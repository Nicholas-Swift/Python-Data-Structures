Original Video and Credit: https://www.instagram.com/p/BMjKkr0AoIt/ This really needs to be upvoted. Thanks for finding it! You're welcome! Hey.... Wait a mi... But your n... Op pls Don't worry, I got you. It's okay. You got this buddy, just use your words. higher please go you Please go you high go high you Please Now we know why the quality was turds. I'm totally in a higher resolution than that, buddy. I was about to start whistling the Battlefield Heroes theme... Thanks, this is better than the 24x24 resolution gif that the OP uploaded. Looks 1,000x better See, this should be the top submission, nevermind the top comment that it. Soon will be StankyShaft. Downvoting OP for potato and upvoting you instead the video has been ripped so many damn times it looks like shit now lol Thats incredible, so much better than the gif. Particularly with the sound. OP it looks like Im watching this through a sheet of wax paper Close. OP had a nylon stocking over his head at the time. Here's what he may have looked like God dammit You should expect it by now. I came here to talk Battlefield. I didn't expect some kind of Spanish Inquisition. NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION! I thought this was going to be the Rick Roll video. It's worth like 6 Rick Rolls Best I can do is 3, but I know a guy who can check it out, lemme give him a call and have him come down, if it's legit maybe we can work something out. I thought it was just gonna be Peyton Manning again. Yeah. I genuinely didn't expect it to be the Spanish Inquisition That's because NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION The Inquisition, what a show, the Inquisition, here we go, we know you're wishing that we'd go awaaaaaay But the Inquisition's here and it's here to staaaaaaay Put her in... THE COMFY CHAIR!!! I still don't know what it is. I expected it, but still clicked. Damn myself. I don't know what I expected, especially with the comment he replied to. Well, if that's not the most appropriate use for that I've ever seen then I'll eat my hat. Fuck now I need to comb thorough all of Reddit just to find a more appropriate use of that just to make u eat ur hat. See u in 64 years. RemindMe! 64 years It's sad that you'll be dead 13 years before this goes off Well 12 years 347 days... but who's counting? Found it!! https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1rynga/my_sister_sent_a_wedding/ :< God. Dammit. Have to ask, did you copy a legit URL for that or did you just make it up? Well played, you got me. cries in corner Hey, what is this meme? I've seen it many times and it's funny even without me knowing the origin or meaning of it. You can read about it here I expected it and you still fuckin got me you piece of shit Truly an impressive piece of fabric, his nylon. Nowhere is safe. I still don't know what this is :( Wow, it's actually way funnier when you see the rest of the video. And in watchable quality too. It's the best way to get color on those old television sets. Maybe he had an old B&W television and just wanted to see it in color. Maybe he dropped a jolly rancher in his PS4 That's because this is real found footage from WW1. A prototype camera that films in color! With futuristic Virtual Reality HUD capabilities. Nah it's just on a console. That's what it looks like. Nintendo DS version. Somehow it looks better on imgur instead of embedded here. I think reddit stretched it a bit, causing additional artifacting or something. The source is still low-res, but it doesn't have those dots at least. This nearly made me rage quit my ISP. #SayNoToPotatoes Op recorded this with the I-potato. his pc could only download and repost the gif in 240p Consoles are getting worse than we ever imagined http://i.imgur.com/DqJWQlm.gifv http://i.imgur.com/TeI03gL.gifv https://gfycat.com/IllustriousQuarrelsomeDunlin https://gfycat.com/DefinitiveMessyAsp Other team player waves "Hello!" "Hiya!" Welp, he's not a threat /r/gamersbeingbros I'm strangely disappointed that this isn't a thing. Edit: Now they've gone and done it! and now it is r/gamersbeingbros Im apart of history now. Being apart would suggest you've been removed from history, which is quite scary. Are you sure you wouldn't rather be a part of history? I'm proud of you. Nice! When I get a pc again I'll try to salvage some old disks... I have a few (very old) WoW screenshots that will fit right in over there! This is awesome It can be if you believe. And make it one. That would actually be a really cool sub In Planetside 2, me and one guy from the other team were capping the same location. We probably capped the place about 5 times each, back to back. I was cloaked the whole time but I started to feel that we had an understanding. When I intentionally revealed my self right in front of him, he killed me. We had something going there, but he blew it. I like sneaking up on enemy snipers and then sniping with them until they notice me. Sometimes it's pistols at dawn, and sometimes, just sometimes, you compete to see who can get the highest score while batting off derogatory comments from your own teams. ;) This is fantastic. I remember doing this in BF4 but I need to try it in BF1. Tends to work a little better in Planet Side because there's 3 factions, so it's entirely possible you'll both be shooting the same people so neither of you feels obligated to protect targets. There is no brotherhood in that game without a harasser. The number of times I've been solo harassering, bumped into another, then had an impromptu race (because fuck the war) So disappoointed :( /r/canadiansgaming include me in the screencap Edit: nevermind, made my own I'm glad that this is a thing You basically created a sub. Ugh.. I NEED MORE! I felt like being nice once. Then I noticed my Ult was charged. Hahaha, that's awesome Or the double honk in GTA:O. This guy be creepin', though. Well that dude is pretty ~chill~ tranquil. I'd kick it in the back of his truck for a bit. Embrace Tranquility Gaze into the anus That anus is heinous. They hate us cuz they anus. We disdain 'em cuz we stain 'em A very HeinusSprainusAnus, in fact. Say heinus anus one too many times and he appears like candyman /r/wehaveseenthebutthole um wot How do we identify the Almighty Butthole? Relevant username. Experience Tranquility Tranquility intensifies *Tankquility LOL. It's awesome how he just looks back at his team like, "Uh, guys? Shit they're gone..." When this came up a while ago, folk were saying "Why didn't he warn the guys?!" but he likely couldn't even if he wanted to. I mean, he could have saved his team by shooting the guy, but the dude got into a position to watch at least three guys walk by obliviously so yeah, maybe he deserves this gimme. Aren't you that guy who fucks cats or something? See, I thought he was a goat fucker too. But I had him tagged. Now I don't. So... this may be a different guy. But he has so much karma Can someone explain to me why you wouldn't just kill these guys? Edit: Okay guys I get it. I was just thinking there was more to it then that. Please don't kill me. Because they asked them not to. Don't kill me pls Cause they're having fun with each other? I play video games and Magic: The Gathering. Sometimes it's more fun to leave the guy who's derping around so he can learn how to play properly. Sometimes it's easier to kill them instantly, but then the fun is one-sided. I do this on overwatch a lot. I like being roadhog, using my hook on a mercy to pull her close, then just wave at them and walk away. I like you. Weapons dealers hate him! I would laugh my ass off if that happened to me. I really want to get better with Hog so I can justify doing that. And then she kills you with her pistol that does a... Damage that is surprising? Hahahaha that's brilliant. Gonna do this to someone. You should make a montage of that. Obviously does not play magic competitively. 5-0s and 3-0s. I play Limited now, hosting Phantom Drafts with all the original Zendikar and Innistrad packs i saved up. Brag over: Casual EDH is not so fun when the same jackass plays Lighthouse Chronologist in MonoU - i'll bin off that guy all day long just to see Little Ben pull of a janky combo with cheap cards he got from his brother. for me, this is like trying to read chinese. Lol I have no idea what you just said That's when you pull out the Phelddagrif EDH deck and hug them. To death. ಠ_ಠ Could be worse. Could be Geist. It would be terribly impolite. Impolite Unnice I mean, neither are wrong. One's just less unwrong than the other. nonpolite Antifriendship Imirony Hi Irony, I'm Dad. Well m'memed. Because it's a nice experience to have shared with another player. Because they're being peaceful and just wave at you? I think our explanations would be wasted on you, evil one. I think it's just a gesture of good sportsmanship. Most of these people are in no position to fight back, so it's just to be friendly. IKR?! If you kill the dude with the pea-shooter he'll just respawn at the start again and the whole trek would be wasted. I once didn't shoot someone in the face during a game of r/Outside paintball and they took the flag. I mean, would you shoot someone 10ft away if only their face was showing? (Yeah, me too, i shot that guy in the face...) "You play to win the game!" - Herm Edwards Cuz it's funny not to Does your username work? lolol Haha no ;-; I feel your pain :( Asking that question already makes you unworthy. Also, if you kill someones who shakes at you, i automatically assume youre inbred. Like the tryhard Symmetras in Skirmish. It's always the Symmetras and Pharahs for some reason. Why won't they let me sit and wave in peace? Also Mccree, it's why I usually skirmish as Ana so at least I can put them to sleep and wave at my leisure. the pirate's code! for the lulz Omnics deserve the right to exist as well. They said not to. What are you? Some kind of rape-murder? What kind of sick fuck kills someone without their consent. Because chivalry is not dead. There's something magical to the sudden break in the mindless shooting to realize that there's another person on the other end. Also, like the Borg not bothering with someone that isn't really a threat -- not worth the ammo or being a dick. Sad! What game is that? Overwatch this is easy to do. i once got all random people to stop fighting and chill on the objective the whole game edit: https://youtu.be/IG5KsOpTobw?t=1m38s Did you reply to yourself? sometimes Extra karma. They save gifs like these for multiplayer game threads They save relevance to add more relevance to the thread. I appreciate it. Better than seeing .gifs fractured all over the place. Sometimes fractured .gifs are relevant Tank you Noooo the gif cuts off the part where the terrorist drops a smoke so the CT can ninja-defuse! I picture the same tank driving doing all of these Reminds me of knife fights in cs. You'd swish your knife out and stab the air. If the other was not craven, you got yourself a good, clean knife fight. Rare, but fun :D This shit taught kids about honor back in the days. If someone swishes his knife, you either swish yours to confirm the duel, or fire a round to deny the challenge. Such are the rules. It is known. These are the ways of the dothraki. It is known. And if you had no honor, you were TKed next round. At the first 0.05 seconds of next round. These are the rules of the duel? Yeah. Break a deal, face the wheel. I remember in smash brothers we would taunt to show we were ready if we were done practicing or trying out a new combo. It was on after that taunt. If you hit me in an opening round taunt, I will do everything in my pathetic skill range to demoralise, humiliate and destroy you. CSGO. It was down to 1v1, me and the CT's last guy. I pulled my knife and swished.... Then heard him do it across the map. Shit was on. We found each other and we're strafing and trying to slash each other for a solid minute. Then he pulled his gun and killed me and won for his team. I don't like csgo. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/bDW7DCG Apparently Harrison Ford was really ill during that scene, and he and Spielberg just agreed that he should "just shoot the son of a bitch". He told that story on his Reddit AMA actually... Also Steve Buscemi was a K9 firefighter on 9/11 after Seth Macfarlane accidentally missed his flight. On the internet, nobody knows you're a K9 firefighter. K9/11 fire fighter jet fuel can't melt steel beams Kind of shitty. That wasn't even a random guy they cut. Apparently he had trained for it for months. I don't see how it's shitty. That's probably one of the most famous movie scenes ever. It's been shown and referenced far more than any generic action movie fight scene would have been. That scene has a funny backstory. They were supposed to have this awesome fight scene between Indy with his whip and the guy with the sword. Harrison Ford was very sick the day the scene was supposed to be shot and suggested Indy just shooting the guy instead. Which is funny, because I really feel like that scene did a good job of definiting Indy's personality. what an ass Something something dysentery. I just described this scene to OP without realizing it's what you posted. I read that Ford was feeling sick that day and didn't want to do the whole scene. I think you forgot this. Get rekt noob! and also the 'Cyka idiot why knif omg noob retard Blyat' get rekt knoob FTFY "NO HONOR" I did something similar once. It was down to 1v1 in a medieval CS-like game (M&B:Warband). I asked the guy in chat where he was from and while he was typing I threw a javelin in his face. Felt bad, but couldn't stop laughing. ...You're a monster. You bastard In the original Gears of War, people would signal to each other from across the map that they wanted to have a good clean shotgun fight, no lancers or pistols. Ugh, I LOVED shotgun fights in the original GoW. There was an art to the roll and blast. They nerfed it in the second one, and I havent played any of them since to see if it's improved. Seriously. That shit was the best part of the game. They somewhat brought it back by Gears 3 after everyone kept complaining (haven't played the 4th) but it was never the same, especially after they made the lancer bullets stop you in your fucking tracks. I honestly thought Gears 3 had much better multiplayer than 1 or 2. It was the first one I could actually play for hours/routinely like a CoD/Halo and still felt fun. Taking away the ability to shoot/roll simultaneously killed the franchise for me. The online in GoW2 was terrible, GoW3 was an improvement and still pretty fun, and then Judgment was legitimately one of the worst games I've ever bought. I traded it in for Halo 4 after two weeks. all i remember is getting stunned for 2 full seconds while swinging out in the open trying to signal them One shot stir fry was my favourite weapon too to play with. i remember you had to stab at the walls to let them hear the knife so that they knew it was time for a knife fight. Ah I miss these days of gamer integrity. Almost forgot about the good ole CS knife fights There was a old map with an Aztec temple and there was a two story room surrounded in pillars. Everyone would sit on the second level... Swoosh knife to declare a challenge, then those two would jump into the pit and fight to the death as everyone watched. Some of the most fun I've had. I have an irrational love for the word craven. I wish I remembered to capture it, but last night I was playing casual overwatch. Jumped over a building as Winston and just happened to land in between a Mercy and her team. None of her team had noticed me. I started to shock the shit out of her, but then she started mashing crouch so hard I couldn't help laughing. I did the "Hello" voiceline and she replied "Thank You". I jumped away and her team never even knew I was there. This is why I love Overwatch but you also have the meis and mccrees who shoot my tracer in the face during skirmish after first sitting around emoting and helloing for a minute. those fuckers. Then you want to make them pay. You put your mlg face on and go out. You take your first perfect shot... they found a game and disappeared. Fuck hold me. now kiss This is why I love gaming in general, such as TF2 FTFY My last skirmish, I was a Bastion, just roaming around and waving hello to the enemy. A Genji came up to me and started saying hello, but everytime I looked away, he would melee me and say hello again. So after a few times I got a little fed up and changed to turret form and he backed away, but I waved the little self healing arm at him and he came back. I started turning away and he moved forward to hit me and I spun and unloaded about 300 dps in his face. It was beautiful Is this a shooters thing? I think you will find this behavior in most games that have no means of communication between teams. That is one of the few understandable actions you can do to get your point across. Reminds me of that scene in Fury I feel like I could literally watch that all day these are amazing lol Is there a subreddit for these? /r/gamersbeingbros was just started as a result of this thread What type of savage has screen capture abilities with the Ps4 or XB1, and uses a potato to record instead? I don't get it. It drives me insane. For that WW1 feel. Where did you get this real footage? OP's is just colourized and sharpened. I hit ctl-z twice. That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about video editing to dispute you. He's lying. Open the gif in a new window and hit alt+F4 to see. *new tab Wake up! Tabs are so 2016. is nothing sacred to hipsters?! In that case, if you're on google chrome, open that gif in a new tab then hit ctrl + w to see This trick only works if you delete your system32 folder first though. I tried to do that but I'm on a mac. How do I delete the System32 folder on a mac? (edit: I love that I got serious replies to this. Reddit so helpful) Don't forget to delete system32 Amateur video editor here, I can assure you that's how it works.

They have strict rules against using magic in the library Significantly better than actual footage I have seen from the era. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSwGT_-WrhE This footage is from Wings (1927). It depicts the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and used over 3500 extras. Edit: misspell This footage is from Wings (1990). It features stock plane footage and kept a bunch of d-list celebrities employed for seven years. This footage is from the wing (1963) It features a gremlin on the wing. This footage is from Gremlins 2 (1990). It features a gremlin with wings. 4:45 minute mark... Start there... Actually pretty funny dialog. I ended up watching the whole episode. Wings isn't too bad. Was that the movie made by Howard Hughes? (The guy that The Aviator was about) This is Wings with an ex-Beatle My lord this is crazy If this is real, it's the best WWI footage I've ever seen. There's a great documentary series using tons of coloured footage from WW1 that's amazingly well done. I believe it's called Apocalypse: World War One using tons of coloured footage from WW1 WW1 in color? Footage of an unnamed war hero bravely defending his battalion from tank fire. Circa 1915 the renault ft was made from 1917-1949. I've read about this moment in history books. Do I look like I know what a daguerreotype is? I just want a picture of a got dang leberwurst. Fake, they didn't have pixels back then. It was the past. If anything there were more pixels around because we hadn't yet started using them all up. That's why old games look pixely. But now we're starting to run out of this natural resource. In twenty years we won't be able to blur out anyone's face for their protection. They'll be forced to wear a bit of frosted glass over their head. Since when has WW1 era film looked like compressed black and white video? WW1 footage wouldn't have those box-shaped digital artifacts muh jpegs! I feel like I've poured soup into my eyes OP has a starch addiction. OP must be a berserk fan. I think we all know his favorite character. Rape Horse? No silly, Casca. :( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH-hXK__zyI He needed external hardware to capture all 30 polygons at once. Its been badly ripped off of the original source. I have seen this clip in hd. Can you direct me to the original clip please? http://coub.com/view/gh5as Couldn't find the one I saw but here is one with a clearer quality. Someone found the original Instagram submission. What's a potato? You know... Po-tay-toes. Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew. https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2tdbig/tifu_by_enraging_the_parents_of_my_girlfriend_by/ It's an older reference, sir, but it checks out I believe Drughi23 is referring to the TIFU where a man pretended not to know what a potato was as a joke and it went terribly wrong It makes it look more cinematic But my phone can record 4k. I'm pretty sure it was just shot in p... That's what I was thinking >.< Why share in HD when you can share a grainy Nokia recording? Its the GIF quality too you dildo Wait, this is B1? I thought it was an N64 game. Jesus OP, get your shit together. Soldier no. SOLIDER YES! SOLDIER, NO! SOLDIER YES!! I teleported bread. How Much? You told me to...

Relevant xkcd https://xkcd.com/1053/ i can never not watch this when it's posted. what a time to be alive! This the best video I've ever seen While high? Maybe This one is so much better than the usual JPEG one. The important question here is, "Why is the rum gone?" My ears..... send help you got more of them pixels? Cmon man you gotta link it! You have to buy 2 consoles and fuse them together https://i.gyazo.com/041dc1ad8f2cbe19d49a4449a3f6fc5a.png Okay guys this one isn't Manning Don't listen to him I love how he turns away at the end I can end you right here, you little shit. You must like warthunder Is that an enemy tank? It's a little hard to see. It's funny however. I love moments of this in Battlefield. It actually reminds me of the Christmas Truce during World War 1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce I seriously hope they do a snowball fight on Christmas in BF1. Just some fun and games between the teams, to simulate the truce. Fuck snowballs. A nice game of association football. Fuck yes! And let us make presents out of brass and stuff. Just let the fighting end for a week or two. Brass snowballs. Happy now? Oh am I :D even better, lets shoot snowballs from cannons and move them! Oh wait thats a tank oh shit, did we just go full circle and start the war again? I guess so. Unless that gif repeats at all times "BF1 Christmas event! For one week, the game will be updated to become Rocket League." Battlefield 1 becomes FIFA 17 for a day You turn on BF1 and you are redirected to the FIFA 17 main menu. The twist is that France is not a playable team. Doughboys ain't gonna like that. "Of course I remember it, I was never offside, that was an appalling decision..." That's what they do in Verdun, a WWI based fps Yeah I've heard of Verdun. Didn't know they did that though. Here's hoping we get something cool as well. Well, there were snowball fights in BF4 for Christmas, so I think our chances are good. Thank you for your service. Joyeux Noel Yep it's an enemy tank. I've seen higher quality Gifs in 2004 post em. This is actually one of the oldest gifs from my meme folder, 2006 That was 2006? Fuck, Zidane jokes are ten years old... this is one of my favorites from years ago Here's an actual gif from 2004 I just got played twice in a row I should have read this and known, known! http://i.imgur.com/o536nVm.gifv God damnit I need to reevaluate my life. I thought "maybe this will be different, maybe it'll actually be a gif from '04". Nope. I got ruined again Holy shit, twice in one thread and neither times I saw it coming. How the fuck did you get such terrible quality from a brand new game. The mind boggles. op (/u/Cyrellis) pretty much everyone on this thread has asked you this question so u need to go ahead and come back to your thread and answer it thx in adv. Possible answer: their internet connection is shit and thus would make a full-quality or even decent-quality video take far too long to reasonably upload, so they compressed the shit out of it to remedy that issue. Believe me, it's possible (my internet is garbage--0.8 Mbps up if I'm lucky and have zero download utilization). What do you pay for your service, if I may ask? Too fucking much for 1.5 Mbps down. Was paying around $35/month, but that pricing has since ended and it seems it's now up to $44/month. Unfortunately the wiring in my damned apartment is too garbage to do much better, and this is the cheapest pricing available here. I pay for 50mbps down, but actually get around 34. I pay $45 a month lol I'd happily trade up for that! OP stole the video. Original vid is found above^ I love the "Let's be friends!" via shaking heads and rapidly jumping. What is this, TF2? More air got blown out of my nose then usual. I concur. No! DON'T TOUCH THAT! W H A T A R E Y O U D O I N G T H R O W I T O N H I M N O T M E T H R O W I T A T H I M N O T M E Don't let your kids watch it! when was battlefield released for the original nes Wow hey! Don't touch me! Good old Brak. Top kek! Must have been so fun to make that show. Soldier: Imma hit it! Tank: Don't you do it! Soldier: IMMA DO IT! Tank: DON'T YOU DO IT! I laughed at this more that I thought I would. This looks like it has some sort of filter to make the game look like an oil on canvas that somebody left outside on a foggy day by accident. Hey. Stop it. If I had a dollar for every pixel in this video, I would have 76 cents Recorded with my Verizon Chocolate Touch Like a toddler temper tantrum Which pixel is the tank? You told me to. I have done nothing but teleport bread for three days. My favorite thing to do in this game is standing on top of a landship and hammer it with a wrench, and since they can't aim up they are forced to walk out of the vehicle to defend it or they'll explode. This works for approximately 5 seconds and then you're shot by one of the 20 enemy snipers. Contender for worst quality gif in history That's hilarious Reminds me of one of those constantly pissed off teachers who just looks down at you from the teachers desk, shaking their head in disappointment. is this 1p resolution most likely a fraction of that. 1/4p maybe? Battlefield 1 looks great! Turn up the jpegs I never laughed so hard watching a gif pretty funny but I was still able to see something in this gif, could you maybe lower the quality a little? Don't make me blast you, man. Oh no... Oh yes... This shit, i love this shit. PLEASE DON'T The quality is so bad, I genuinely thought this was from battlefield heroes. Canadian forces? French actually, the tank in the gif is a Renault FT, developed by the French and widely used by many of the allied powers during ww1, the insignia on the tank is used by the French for armoured vechicles. So your hitting your own tank? what does this help? It increases the tank's velocity by small increments, overtime though this adds up. Check the top and the roundel. thats hard to tell on that quality. if you are on diffrent teams, then how the fuck didnt he just blast you? Battlefield is a magical game with magical players. I would have blasted you. I'm not magical. Remember that opening cinematic where the two guys don't shoot eachother? It's kind of like that. I suck so bad I'll grab any chance to improve my stats In Overwatch apparently there is an unwritten rule that if someone from the other team comes over and emotes, you don't kill them. I always kill them. So you're the son of a bitch that kills me when I'm just trying to dab with genji. It comes from TF2. Please don't kill them. If you wanna go full serious, just say hello and then walk away ignoring them. Some people just want to have some different fun once in a while. You NEVER and I mean NEVER kill the spy crab they're a rare and endangered species!! Rules are boring. Games are best when you break the rules. In skirmish at the very least. never kill a man in skirmish Oh, so you're that asshole. Op is not the player I can't tell anything, the quality is to low Would have been good if it wasn't recorded with a 2001 flipphone. i thought this was a ps1 game at first and i was trying to figure out what game. but then i realized... Damn is this what the PS4Pro looks like? Did you record this on VHS by chance? r I believe I've never seen a gif with such low quality as this. Recorded with the worlds finest potato. I love watching gameplay of BF1 and I have no intention on buying it I can count the pixel in this gif "No! Bad Ottoman!" I wanted the tank to fire. What is this? Battlefield Potato cam. I'd love to upvote this, too bad you don't have the game in the title :( Crash Bandicoot Racing Battlefield 1 Dark souls 3 I didn't know a tank could be cute! It's not No - Yes!!! - Nooo! You need to start recording with a better potato. HIT THE OBVIOUS WEAK SPOT!!!!!! I laughed; a lot. I'm at work. Good thing I'm the only one on this floor over the weekend. I snorted. I couldn't stop laughing lol, don't know why I found this so funny. Thanks OP! :) Recorded on a potato? In a game? this entire post just made my day The quality is so poor I thought this was Battlefield 1942 If you're going to steal someone's video, at least steal it the correct way lol The amount of "puckering up" his butthole did when the head of the tank turned around is probably hilarious on it own but that was just gold man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos [deleted] https://gfycat.com/ShockedIllinformedBug no.no. you stop that. ok. I never thought that someone could make a gif look like a jpg, but somehow op, you managed it. Anyone else see the crocodile mouth at the tail of the tank? I can't unsee it now. If that was me I would have been killed instantly He's not mad, he's just disappointed. Came to comments section expecting 99% to be about the quality of the gif. Was not disappointed. One of my favorite moments was when I was in a squad with randoms and we were doing amazing at silent teamwork. As we were moving to the next objective we came across a heavy tank with no side gunners. None of us had explosives so we climbed on top and started to beat the tank with our melee weapons. ...want to get blown up? ...because that's how you get blown up... This would be 10x funnier if it didn't look like it was recorded during WWI. WW1 had better quality then that potato This made me laugh harder than I expected. No! You do not get to blow me up. Good day sir. I said good day! Set GFX to potato for that authentic underwater-without-googles-getting-chlorine-in-the-eyes effect 10/10 too funny Battlefield at its best. TIL that WWI was pretty damn adorable. I love these fucking videos xD. No! Yes! No! Yes! not today, pal Just because the game is set in WW1 doesn't mean your gif has to be too This was actually filmed during WW1 judging from the quality I see you used the ww1 camera to fit the apnosphere. This really needs to be upvoted. Thanks for finding it! You're welcome! Hey.... Wait a mi... But your n... Op pls Don't worry, I got you. It's okay. You got this buddy, just use your words. higher please go you Please go you high go high you Please Now we know why the quality was turds. I'm totally in a higher resolution than that, buddy. I was about to start whistling the Battlefield Heroes theme... Thanks, this is better than the 24x24 resolution gif that the OP uploaded. Looks 1,000x better See, this should be the top submission, nevermind the top comment that it. Soon will be StankyShaft. Downvoting OP for potato and upvoting you instead the video has been ripped so many damn times it looks like shit now lol Thats incredible, so much better than the gif. Particularly with the sound. You're welcome! Hey.... Wait a mi... But your n... Op pls Don't worry, I got you. It's okay. You got this buddy, just use your words. Hey.... Wait a mi... But your n... Op pls Don't worry, I got you. It's okay. You got this buddy, just use your words. Don't worry, I got you. It's okay. You got this buddy, just use your words. Please go you high go high you Please go high you Please I'm totally in a higher resolution than that, buddy. I was about to start whistling the Battlefield Heroes theme... Close. OP had a nylon stocking over his head at the time. Here's what he may have looked like God dammit You should expect it by now. I came here to talk Battlefield. I didn't expect some kind of Spanish Inquisition. NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION! I thought this was going to be the Rick Roll video. It's worth like 6 Rick Rolls Best I can do is 3, but I know a guy who can check it out, lemme give him a call and have him come down, if it's legit maybe we can work something out. I thought it was just gonna be Peyton Manning again. Yeah. I genuinely didn't expect it to be the Spanish Inquisition That's because NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION The Inquisition, what a show, the Inquisition, here we go, we know you're wishing that we'd go awaaaaaay But the Inquisition's here and it's here to staaaaaaay Put her in... THE COMFY CHAIR!!! I still don't know what it is. I expected it, but still clicked. Damn myself. I don't know what I expected, especially with the comment he replied to. Well, if that's not the most appropriate use for that I've ever seen then I'll eat my hat. Fuck now I need to comb thorough all of Reddit just to find a more appropriate use of that just to make u eat ur hat. See u in 64 years.

I still don't know what this is :( Wow, it's actually way funnier when you see the rest of the video. And in watchable quality too. It's the best way to get color on those old television sets. Maybe he had an old B&W television and just wanted to see it in color. Maybe he dropped a jolly rancher in his PS4 That's because this is real found footage from WW1. A prototype camera that films in color! With futuristic Virtual Reality HUD capabilities. Nah it's just on a console. That's what it looks like. Nintendo DS version. Somehow it looks better on imgur instead of embedded here. I think reddit stretched it a bit, causing additional artifacting or something. The source is still low-res, but it doesn't have those dots at least. This nearly made me rage quit my ISP. #SayNoToPotatoes Op recorded this with the I-potato. his pc could only download and repost the gif in 240p Consoles are getting worse than we ever imagined Here's what he may have looked like God dammit You should expect it by now.

Welp, he's not a threat /r/gamersbeingbros I'm strangely disappointed that this isn't a thing. Edit: Now they've gone and done it! and now it is r/gamersbeingbros Im apart of history now. Being apart would suggest you've been removed from history, which is quite scary. Are you sure you wouldn't rather be a part of history? I'm proud of you. Nice! When I get a pc again I'll try to salvage some old disks... I have a few (very old) WoW screenshots that will fit right in over there! This is awesome It can be if you believe. And make it one. That would actually be a really cool sub In Planetside 2, me and one guy from the other team were capping the same location. We probably capped the place about 5 times each, back to back. I was cloaked the whole time but I started to feel that we had an understanding. When I intentionally revealed my self right in front of him, he killed me. We had something going there, but he blew it. I like sneaking up on enemy snipers and then sniping with them until they notice me. Sometimes it's pistols at dawn, and sometimes, just sometimes, you compete to see who can get the highest score while batting off derogatory comments from your own teams. ;) This is fantastic. I remember doing this in BF4 but I need to try it in BF1. Tends to work a little better in Planet Side because there's 3 factions, so it's entirely possible you'll both be shooting the same people so neither of you feels obligated to protect targets. There is no brotherhood in that game without a harasser. The number of times I've been solo harassering, bumped into another, then had an impromptu race (because fuck the war) So disappoointed :( /r/canadiansgaming include me in the screencap Edit: nevermind, made my own I'm glad that this is a thing You basically created a sub. Ugh.. I NEED MORE! I felt like being nice once. Then I noticed my Ult was charged. Hahaha, that's awesome Or the double honk in GTA:O. This guy be creepin', though. Well that dude is pretty ~chill~ tranquil. I'd kick it in the back of his truck for a bit. Embrace Tranquility Gaze into the anus That anus is heinous. They hate us cuz they anus. We disdain 'em cuz we stain 'em A very HeinusSprainusAnus, in fact. Say heinus anus one too many times and he appears like candyman /r/wehaveseenthebutthole um wot How do we identify the Almighty Butthole? Relevant username. Experience Tranquility Tranquility intensifies *Tankquility LOL. It's awesome how he just looks back at his team like, "Uh, guys? Shit they're gone..." When this came up a while ago, folk were saying "Why didn't he warn the guys?!" but he likely couldn't even if he wanted to. I mean, he could have saved his team by shooting the guy, but the dude got into a position to watch at least three guys walk by obliviously so yeah, maybe he deserves this gimme. Aren't you that guy who fucks cats or something? See, I thought he was a goat fucker too. But I had him tagged. Now I don't. So... this may be a different guy. But he has so much karma Can someone explain to me why you wouldn't just kill these guys? Edit: Okay guys I get it. I was just thinking there was more to it then that. Please don't kill me. Because they asked them not to. Don't kill me pls Cause they're having fun with each other? I play video games and Magic: The Gathering. Sometimes it's more fun to leave the guy who's derping around so he can learn how to play properly. Sometimes it's easier to kill them instantly, but then the fun is one-sided. I do this on overwatch a lot. I like being roadhog, using my hook on a mercy to pull her close, then just wave at them and walk away. I like you. Weapons dealers hate him! I would laugh my ass off if that happened to me. I really want to get better with Hog so I can justify doing that. And then she kills you with her pistol that does a... Damage that is surprising? Hahahaha that's brilliant. Gonna do this to someone. You should make a montage of that. Obviously does not play magic competitively. 5-0s and 3-0s. I play Limited now, hosting Phantom Drafts with all the original Zendikar and Innistrad packs i saved up. Brag over: Casual EDH is not so fun when the same jackass plays Lighthouse Chronologist in MonoU - i'll bin off that guy all day long just to see Little Ben pull of a janky combo with cheap cards he got from his brother. for me, this is like trying to read chinese. Lol I have no idea what you just said That's when you pull out the Phelddagrif EDH deck and hug them. To death. ಠ_ಠ Could be worse. Could be Geist. It would be terribly impolite. Impolite Unnice I mean, neither are wrong. One's just less unwrong than the other. nonpolite Antifriendship Imirony Hi Irony, I'm Dad. Well m'memed. Because it's a nice experience to have shared with another player. Because they're being peaceful and just wave at you? I think our explanations would be wasted on you, evil one. I think it's just a gesture of good sportsmanship. Most of these people are in no position to fight back, so it's just to be friendly. IKR?! If you kill the dude with the pea-shooter he'll just respawn at the start again and the whole trek would be wasted. I once didn't shoot someone in the face during a game of r/Outside paintball and they took the flag. I mean, would you shoot someone 10ft away if only their face was showing? (Yeah, me too, i shot that guy in the face...) "You play to win the game!" - Herm Edwards Cuz it's funny not to Does your username work? lolol Haha no ;-; I feel your pain :( Asking that question already makes you unworthy. Also, if you kill someones who shakes at you, i automatically assume youre inbred. Like the tryhard Symmetras in Skirmish. It's always the Symmetras and Pharahs for some reason. Why won't they let me sit and wave in peace? Also Mccree, it's why I usually skirmish as Ana so at least I can put them to sleep and wave at my leisure. the pirate's code! for the lulz Omnics deserve the right to exist as well. They said not to. What are you? Some kind of rape-murder? What kind of sick fuck kills someone without their consent. Because chivalry is not dead. There's something magical to the sudden break in the mindless shooting to realize that there's another person on the other end. Also, like the Borg not bothering with someone that isn't really a threat -- not worth the ammo or being a dick. Sad! What game is that? Overwatch this is easy to do. i once got all random people to stop fighting and chill on the objective the whole game edit: https://youtu.be/IG5KsOpTobw?t=1m38s Did you reply to yourself? sometimes Extra karma. They save gifs like these for multiplayer game threads They save relevance to add more relevance to the thread. I appreciate it. Better than seeing .gifs fractured all over the place. Sometimes fractured .gifs are relevant Tank you Noooo the gif cuts off the part where the terrorist drops a smoke so the CT can ninja-defuse! I picture the same tank driving doing all of these Reminds me of knife fights in cs. You'd swish your knife out and stab the air. If the other was not craven, you got yourself a good, clean knife fight. Rare, but fun :D This shit taught kids about honor back in the days. If someone swishes his knife, you either swish yours to confirm the duel, or fire a round to deny the challenge. Such are the rules. It is known. These are the ways of the dothraki. It is known. And if you had no honor, you were TKed next round. At the first 0.05 seconds of next round. These are the rules of the duel? Yeah. Break a deal, face the wheel. I remember in smash brothers we would taunt to show we were ready if we were done practicing or trying out a new combo. It was on after that taunt. If you hit me in an opening round taunt, I will do everything in my pathetic skill range to demoralise, humiliate and destroy you. CSGO. It was down to 1v1, me and the CT's last guy. I pulled my knife and swished.... Then heard him do it across the map. Shit was on. We found each other and we're strafing and trying to slash each other for a solid minute. Then he pulled his gun and killed me and won for his team. I don't like csgo. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/bDW7DCG Apparently Harrison Ford was really ill during that scene, and he and Spielberg just agreed that he should "just shoot the son of a bitch". He told that story on his Reddit AMA actually... Also Steve Buscemi was a K9 firefighter on 9/11 after Seth Macfarlane accidentally missed his flight. On the internet, nobody knows you're a K9 firefighter. K9/11 fire fighter jet fuel can't melt steel beams Kind of shitty. That wasn't even a random guy they cut. Apparently he had trained for it for months. I don't see how it's shitty. That's probably one of the most famous movie scenes ever. It's been shown and referenced far more than any generic action movie fight scene would have been. That scene has a funny backstory. They were supposed to have this awesome fight scene between Indy with his whip and the guy with the sword. Harrison Ford was very sick the day the scene was supposed to be shot and suggested Indy just shooting the guy instead. Which is funny, because I really feel like that scene did a good job of definiting Indy's personality. what an ass Something something dysentery. I just described this scene to OP without realizing it's what you posted. I read that Ford was feeling sick that day and didn't want to do the whole scene. I think you forgot this. Get rekt noob! and also the 'Cyka idiot why knif omg noob retard Blyat' get rekt knoob FTFY "NO HONOR" I did something similar once. It was down to 1v1 in a medieval CS-like game (M&B:Warband). I asked the guy in chat where he was from and while he was typing I threw a javelin in his face. Felt bad, but couldn't stop laughing. ...You're a monster. You bastard In the original Gears of War, people would signal to each other from across the map that they wanted to have a good clean shotgun fight, no lancers or pistols. Ugh, I LOVED shotgun fights in the original GoW. There was an art to the roll and blast. They nerfed it in the second one, and I havent played any of them since to see if it's improved. Seriously. That shit was the best part of the game. They somewhat brought it back by Gears 3 after everyone kept complaining (haven't played the 4th) but it was never the same, especially after they made the lancer bullets stop you in your fucking tracks. I honestly thought Gears 3 had much better multiplayer than 1 or 2. It was the first one I could actually play for hours/routinely like a CoD/Halo and still felt fun. Taking away the ability to shoot/roll simultaneously killed the franchise for me. The online in GoW2 was terrible, GoW3 was an improvement and still pretty fun, and then Judgment was legitimately one of the worst games I've ever bought. I traded it in for Halo 4 after two weeks. all i remember is getting stunned for 2 full seconds while swinging out in the open trying to signal them One shot stir fry was my favourite weapon too to play with. i remember you had to stab at the walls to let them hear the knife so that they knew it was time for a knife fight. Ah I miss these days of gamer integrity. Almost forgot about the good ole CS knife fights There was a old map with an Aztec temple and there was a two story room surrounded in pillars. Everyone would sit on the second level... Swoosh knife to declare a challenge, then those two would jump into the pit and fight to the death as everyone watched. Some of the most fun I've had. I have an irrational love for the word craven. I wish I remembered to capture it, but last night I was playing casual overwatch. Jumped over a building as Winston and just happened to land in between a Mercy and her team. None of her team had noticed me. I started to shock the shit out of her, but then she started mashing crouch so hard I couldn't help laughing. I did the "Hello" voiceline and she replied "Thank You". I jumped away and her team never even knew I was there. This is why I love Overwatch but you also have the meis and mccrees who shoot my tracer in the face during skirmish after first sitting around emoting and helloing for a minute. those fuckers. Then you want to make them pay. You put your mlg face on and go out. You take your first perfect shot... they found a game and disappeared. Fuck hold me. now kiss This is why I love gaming in general, such as TF2 FTFY My last skirmish, I was a Bastion, just roaming around and waving hello to the enemy. A Genji came up to me and started saying hello, but everytime I looked away, he would melee me and say hello again. So after a few times I got a little fed up and changed to turret form and he backed away, but I waved the little self healing arm at him and he came back. I started turning away and he moved forward to hit me and I spun and unloaded about 300 dps in his face. It was beautiful Is this a shooters thing? I think you will find this behavior in most games that have no means of communication between teams. That is one of the few understandable actions you can do to get your point across. Reminds me of that scene in Fury I feel like I could literally watch that all day these are amazing lol Is there a subreddit for these? /r/gamersbeingbros was just started as a result of this thread https://gfycat.com/IllustriousQuarrelsomeDunlin https://gfycat.com/DefinitiveMessyAsp Other team player waves "Hello!"

I mean, he could have saved his team by shooting the guy, but the dude got into a position to watch at least three guys walk by obliviously so yeah, maybe he deserves this gimme. Aren't you that guy who fucks cats or something? See, I thought he was a goat fucker too. But I had him tagged. Now I don't. So... this may be a different guy. But he has so much karma Can someone explain to me why you wouldn't just kill these guys? Edit: Okay guys I get it. I was just thinking there was more to it then that. Please don't kill me. Because they asked them not to. Don't kill me pls Cause they're having fun with each other? I play video games and Magic: The Gathering. Sometimes it's more fun to leave the guy who's derping around so he can learn how to play properly. Sometimes it's easier to kill them instantly, but then the fun is one-sided. I do this on overwatch a lot. I like being roadhog, using my hook on a mercy to pull her close, then just wave at them and walk away. I like you. Weapons dealers hate him! I would laugh my ass off if that happened to me. I really want to get better with Hog so I can justify doing that. And then she kills you with her pistol that does a... Damage that is surprising? Hahahaha that's brilliant. Gonna do this to someone. You should make a montage of that. Obviously does not play magic competitively. 5-0s and 3-0s. I play Limited now, hosting Phantom Drafts with all the original Zendikar and Innistrad packs i saved up. Brag over: Casual EDH is not so fun when the same jackass plays Lighthouse Chronologist in MonoU - i'll bin off that guy all day long just to see Little Ben pull of a janky combo with cheap cards he got from his brother. for me, this is like trying to read chinese. Lol I have no idea what you just said That's when you pull out the Phelddagrif EDH deck and hug them. To death. ಠ_ಠ Could be worse. Could be Geist. It would be terribly impolite. Impolite Unnice I mean, neither are wrong. One's just less unwrong than the other. nonpolite Antifriendship Imirony Hi Irony, I'm Dad. Well m'memed. Because it's a nice experience to have shared with another player. Because they're being peaceful and just wave at you? I think our explanations would be wasted on you, evil one. I think it's just a gesture of good sportsmanship. Most of these people are in no position to fight back, so it's just to be friendly. IKR?! If you kill the dude with the pea-shooter he'll just respawn at the start again and the whole trek would be wasted. I once didn't shoot someone in the face during a game of r/Outside paintball and they took the flag. I mean, would you shoot someone 10ft away if only their face was showing? (Yeah, me too, i shot that guy in the face...) "You play to win the game!" - Herm Edwards Cuz it's funny not to Does your username work? lolol Haha no ;-; I feel your pain :( Asking that question already makes you unworthy. Also, if you kill someones who shakes at you, i automatically assume youre inbred. Like the tryhard Symmetras in Skirmish. It's always the Symmetras and Pharahs for some reason. Why won't they let me sit and wave in peace? Also Mccree, it's why I usually skirmish as Ana so at least I can put them to sleep and wave at my leisure. the pirate's code! for the lulz Omnics deserve the right to exist as well. They said not to. What are you? Some kind of rape-murder? What kind of sick fuck kills someone without their consent. Because chivalry is not dead. There's something magical to the sudden break in the mindless shooting to realize that there's another person on the other end. Also, like the Borg not bothering with someone that isn't really a threat -- not worth the ammo or being a dick. Sad! What game is that? Overwatch this is easy to do. i once got all random people to stop fighting and chill on the objective the whole game edit: https://youtu.be/IG5KsOpTobw?t=1m38s Did you reply to yourself? sometimes Extra karma. They save gifs like these for multiplayer game threads They save relevance to add more relevance to the thread. I appreciate it. Better than seeing .gifs fractured all over the place. Sometimes fractured .gifs are relevant Tank you Noooo the gif cuts off the part where the terrorist drops a smoke so the CT can ninja-defuse! I picture the same tank driving doing all of these Reminds me of knife fights in cs. You'd swish your knife out and stab the air. If the other was not craven, you got yourself a good, clean knife fight. Rare, but fun :D This shit taught kids about honor back in the days. If someone swishes his knife, you either swish yours to confirm the duel, or fire a round to deny the challenge. Such are the rules. It is known. These are the ways of the dothraki. It is known. And if you had no honor, you were TKed next round. At the first 0.05 seconds of next round. These are the rules of the duel? Yeah. Break a deal, face the wheel. I remember in smash brothers we would taunt to show we were ready if we were done practicing or trying out a new combo. It was on after that taunt. If you hit me in an opening round taunt, I will do everything in my pathetic skill range to demoralise, humiliate and destroy you. CSGO. It was down to 1v1, me and the CT's last guy. I pulled my knife and swished.... Then heard him do it across the map. Shit was on. We found each other and we're strafing and trying to slash each other for a solid minute. Then he pulled his gun and killed me and won for his team. I don't like csgo. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/bDW7DCG Apparently Harrison Ford was really ill during that scene, and he and Spielberg just agreed that he should "just shoot the son of a bitch". He told that story on his Reddit AMA actually... Also Steve Buscemi was a K9 firefighter on 9/11 after Seth Macfarlane accidentally missed his flight. On the internet, nobody knows you're a K9 firefighter. K9/11 fire fighter jet fuel can't melt steel beams Kind of shitty. That wasn't even a random guy they cut. Apparently he had trained for it for months. I don't see how it's shitty. That's probably one of the most famous movie scenes ever. It's been shown and referenced far more than any generic action movie fight scene would have been. That scene has a funny backstory. They were supposed to have this awesome fight scene between Indy with his whip and the guy with the sword. Harrison Ford was very sick the day the scene was supposed to be shot and suggested Indy just shooting the guy instead. Which is funny, because I really feel like that scene did a good job of definiting Indy's personality. what an ass Something something dysentery. I just described this scene to OP without realizing it's what you posted. I read that Ford was feeling sick that day and didn't want to do the whole scene. I think you forgot this. Get rekt noob! and also the 'Cyka idiot why knif omg noob retard Blyat' get rekt knoob FTFY "NO HONOR" I did something similar once. It was down to 1v1 in a medieval CS-like game (M&B:Warband). I asked the guy in chat where he was from and while he was typing I threw a javelin in his face. Felt bad, but couldn't stop laughing. ...You're a monster. You bastard In the original Gears of War, people would signal to each other from across the map that they wanted to have a good clean shotgun fight, no lancers or pistols. Ugh, I LOVED shotgun fights in the original GoW. There was an art to the roll and blast. They nerfed it in the second one, and I havent played any of them since to see if it's improved. Seriously. That shit was the best part of the game. They somewhat brought it back by Gears 3 after everyone kept complaining (haven't played the 4th) but it was never the same, especially after they made the lancer bullets stop you in your fucking tracks. I honestly thought Gears 3 had much better multiplayer than 1 or 2. It was the first one I could actually play for hours/routinely like a CoD/Halo and still felt fun. Taking away the ability to shoot/roll simultaneously killed the franchise for me. The online in GoW2 was terrible, GoW3 was an improvement and still pretty fun, and then Judgment was legitimately one of the worst games I've ever bought. I traded it in for Halo 4 after two weeks. all i remember is getting stunned for 2 full seconds while swinging out in the open trying to signal them One shot stir fry was my favourite weapon too to play with. i remember you had to stab at the walls to let them hear the knife so that they knew it was time for a knife fight. Ah I miss these days of gamer integrity. Almost forgot about the good ole CS knife fights There was a old map with an Aztec temple and there was a two story room surrounded in pillars. Everyone would sit on the second level... Swoosh knife to declare a challenge, then those two would jump into the pit and fight to the death as everyone watched. Some of the most fun I've had. I have an irrational love for the word craven. I wish I remembered to capture it, but last night I was playing casual overwatch. Jumped over a building as Winston and just happened to land in between a Mercy and her team. None of her team had noticed me. I started to shock the shit out of her, but then she started mashing crouch so hard I couldn't help laughing. I did the "Hello" voiceline and she replied "Thank You". I jumped away and her team never even knew I was there. This is why I love Overwatch but you also have the meis and mccrees who shoot my tracer in the face during skirmish after first sitting around emoting and helloing for a minute. those fuckers. Then you want to make them pay. You put your mlg face on and go out. You take your first perfect shot... they found a game and disappeared. Fuck hold me. now kiss This is why I love gaming in general, such as TF2 FTFY My last skirmish, I was a Bastion, just roaming around and waving hello to the enemy. A Genji came up to me and started saying hello, but everytime I looked away, he would melee me and say hello again. So after a few times I got a little fed up and changed to turret form and he backed away, but I waved the little self healing arm at him and he came back. I started turning away and he moved forward to hit me and I spun and unloaded about 300 dps in his face. It was beautiful Is this a shooters thing? I think you will find this behavior in most games that have no means of communication between teams. That is one of the few understandable actions you can do to get your point across. Reminds me of that scene in Fury https://gfycat.com/DefinitiveMessyAsp Other team player waves "Hello!" "Hiya!" Welp, he's not a threat /r/gamersbeingbros I'm strangely disappointed that this isn't a thing. Edit: Now they've gone and done it! and now it is r/gamersbeingbros Im apart of history now. Being apart would suggest you've been removed from history, which is quite scary. Are you sure you wouldn't rather be a part of history? I'm proud of you. Nice! When I get a pc again I'll try to salvage some old disks... I have a few (very old) WoW screenshots that will fit right in over there! This is awesome It can be if you believe. And make it one. That would actually be a really cool sub In Planetside 2, me and one guy from the other team were capping the same location. We probably capped the place about 5 times each, back to back. I was cloaked the whole time but I started to feel that we had an understanding. When I intentionally revealed my self right in front of him, he killed me. We had something going there, but he blew it. I like sneaking up on enemy snipers and then sniping with them until they notice me. Sometimes it's pistols at dawn, and sometimes, just sometimes, you compete to see who can get the highest score while batting off derogatory comments from your own teams. ;) This is fantastic. I remember doing this in BF4 but I need to try it in BF1. Tends to work a little better in Planet Side because there's 3 factions, so it's entirely possible you'll both be shooting the same people so neither of you feels obligated to protect targets. There is no brotherhood in that game without a harasser. The number of times I've been solo harassering, bumped into another, then had an impromptu race (because fuck the war) So disappoointed :( /r/canadiansgaming include me in the screencap Edit: nevermind, made my own I'm glad that this is a thing You basically created a sub. Ugh.. I NEED MORE! I felt like being nice once. Then I noticed my Ult was charged. Hahaha, that's awesome Or the double honk in GTA:O. This guy be creepin', though.

I do this on overwatch a lot. I like being roadhog, using my hook on a mercy to pull her close, then just wave at them and walk away. I like you. Weapons dealers hate him! I would laugh my ass off if that happened to me. I really want to get better with Hog so I can justify doing that. And then she kills you with her pistol that does a... Damage that is surprising? Hahahaha that's brilliant. Gonna do this to someone. You should make a montage of that. Obviously does not play magic competitively. 5-0s and 3-0s. I play Limited now, hosting Phantom Drafts with all the original Zendikar and Innistrad packs i saved up. Brag over: Casual EDH is not so fun when the same jackass plays Lighthouse Chronologist in MonoU - i'll bin off that guy all day long just to see Little Ben pull of a janky combo with cheap cards he got from his brother. for me, this is like trying to read chinese. Lol I have no idea what you just said That's when you pull out the Phelddagrif EDH deck and hug them. To death. ಠ_ಠ Could be worse. Could be Geist. It would be terribly impolite. Impolite Unnice I mean, neither are wrong. One's just less unwrong than the other. nonpolite Antifriendship Imirony Hi Irony, I'm Dad. Well m'memed. Because it's a nice experience to have shared with another player. Because they're being peaceful and just wave at you? I think our explanations would be wasted on you, evil one. I think it's just a gesture of good sportsmanship. Most of these people are in no position to fight back, so it's just to be friendly. IKR?! If you kill the dude with the pea-shooter he'll just respawn at the start again and the whole trek would be wasted. I once didn't shoot someone in the face during a game of r/Outside paintball and they took the flag. I mean, would you shoot someone 10ft away if only their face was showing? (Yeah, me too, i shot that guy in the face...) "You play to win the game!" - Herm Edwards Cuz it's funny not to Does your username work? lolol Haha no ;-; I feel your pain :( Asking that question already makes you unworthy. Also, if you kill someones who shakes at you, i automatically assume youre inbred. Like the tryhard Symmetras in Skirmish. It's always the Symmetras and Pharahs for some reason. Why won't they let me sit and wave in peace? Also Mccree, it's why I usually skirmish as Ana so at least I can put them to sleep and wave at my leisure. the pirate's code! for the lulz Omnics deserve the right to exist as well. They said not to. What are you? Some kind of rape-murder? What kind of sick fuck kills someone without their consent. Because chivalry is not dead. There's something magical to the sudden break in the mindless shooting to realize that there's another person on the other end. Also, like the Borg not bothering with someone that isn't really a threat -- not worth the ammo or being a dick. Sad! Don't kill me pls I play video games and Magic: The Gathering.

Sometimes fractured .gifs are relevant Sometimes fractured .gifs are relevant This shit taught kids about honor back in the days. If someone swishes his knife, you either swish yours to confirm the duel, or fire a round to deny the challenge. Such are the rules. It is known. These are the ways of the dothraki. It is known. And if you had no honor, you were TKed next round. At the first 0.05 seconds of next round. These are the rules of the duel? Yeah. Break a deal, face the wheel. I remember in smash brothers we would taunt to show we were ready if we were done practicing or trying out a new combo. It was on after that taunt. If you hit me in an opening round taunt, I will do everything in my pathetic skill range to demoralise, humiliate and destroy you. CSGO. It was down to 1v1, me and the CT's last guy. I pulled my knife and swished.... Then heard him do it across the map. Shit was on. We found each other and we're strafing and trying to slash each other for a solid minute. Then he pulled his gun and killed me and won for his team. I don't like csgo. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/bDW7DCG Apparently Harrison Ford was really ill during that scene, and he and Spielberg just agreed that he should "just shoot the son of a bitch". He told that story on his Reddit AMA actually... Also Steve Buscemi was a K9 firefighter on 9/11 after Seth Macfarlane accidentally missed his flight. On the internet, nobody knows you're a K9 firefighter. K9/11 fire fighter jet fuel can't melt steel beams Kind of shitty. That wasn't even a random guy they cut. Apparently he had trained for it for months. I don't see how it's shitty. That's probably one of the most famous movie scenes ever. It's been shown and referenced far more than any generic action movie fight scene would have been. That scene has a funny backstory. They were supposed to have this awesome fight scene between Indy with his whip and the guy with the sword. Harrison Ford was very sick the day the scene was supposed to be shot and suggested Indy just shooting the guy instead. Which is funny, because I really feel like that scene did a good job of definiting Indy's personality. what an ass Something something dysentery. I just described this scene to OP without realizing it's what you posted. I read that Ford was feeling sick that day and didn't want to do the whole scene. I think you forgot this. Get rekt noob! and also the 'Cyka idiot why knif omg noob retard Blyat' get rekt knoob FTFY "NO HONOR" I did something similar once. It was down to 1v1 in a medieval CS-like game (M&B:Warband). I asked the guy in chat where he was from and while he was typing I threw a javelin in his face. Felt bad, but couldn't stop laughing. ...You're a monster. You bastard In the original Gears of War, people would signal to each other from across the map that they wanted to have a good clean shotgun fight, no lancers or pistols. Ugh, I LOVED shotgun fights in the original GoW. There was an art to the roll and blast. They nerfed it in the second one, and I havent played any of them since to see if it's improved. Seriously. That shit was the best part of the game. They somewhat brought it back by Gears 3 after everyone kept complaining (haven't played the 4th) but it was never the same, especially after they made the lancer bullets stop you in your fucking tracks. I honestly thought Gears 3 had much better multiplayer than 1 or 2. It was the first one I could actually play for hours/routinely like a CoD/Halo and still felt fun. Taking away the ability to shoot/roll simultaneously killed the franchise for me. The online in GoW2 was terrible, GoW3 was an improvement and still pretty fun, and then Judgment was legitimately one of the worst games I've ever bought. I traded it in for Halo 4 after two weeks. all i remember is getting stunned for 2 full seconds while swinging out in the open trying to signal them One shot stir fry was my favourite weapon too to play with. i remember you had to stab at the walls to let them hear the knife so that they knew it was time for a knife fight. Ah I miss these days of gamer integrity. Almost forgot about the good ole CS knife fights There was a old map with an Aztec temple and there was a two story room surrounded in pillars. Everyone would sit on the second level... Swoosh knife to declare a challenge, then those two would jump into the pit and fight to the death as everyone watched. Some of the most fun I've had. I have an irrational love for the word craven. It is known. These are the ways of the dothraki. It is known. And if you had no honor, you were TKed next round.

This is why I love Overwatch but you also have the meis and mccrees who shoot my tracer in the face during skirmish after first sitting around emoting and helloing for a minute. those fuckers. Then you want to make them pay. You put your mlg face on and go out. You take your first perfect shot... they found a game and disappeared. Fuck hold me. now kiss This is why I love gaming in general, such as TF2 FTFY My last skirmish, I was a Bastion, just roaming around and waving hello to the enemy. A Genji came up to me and started saying hello, but everytime I looked away, he would melee me and say hello again. So after a few times I got a little fed up and changed to turret form and he backed away, but I waved the little self healing arm at him and he came back. I started turning away and he moved forward to hit me and I spun and unloaded about 300 dps in his face.

There's a great documentary series using tons of coloured footage from WW1 that's amazingly well done.

Just let the fighting end for a week or two. Brass snowballs. Happy now? Oh am I :D even better, lets shoot snowballs from cannons and move them! Oh wait thats a tank oh shit, did we just go full circle and start the war again? I guess so. Unless that gif repeats at all times "BF1 Christmas event! For one week, the game will be updated to become Rocket League." Battlefield 1 becomes FIFA 17 for a day You turn on BF1 and you are redirected to the FIFA 17 main menu. The twist is that France is not a playable team. Doughboys ain't gonna like that. "Of course I remember it, I was never offside, that was an appalling decision..." That's what they do in Verdun, a WWI based fps Yeah I've heard of Verdun. Didn't know they did that though. Here's hoping we get something cool as well.

Possible answer: their internet connection is shit and thus would make a full-quality or even decent-quality video take far too long to reasonably upload, so they compressed the shit out of it to remedy that issue. Believe me, it's possible (my internet is garbage--0.8 Mbps up if I'm lucky and have zero download utilization). What do you pay for your service, if I may ask? Too fucking much for 1.5 Mbps down. Was paying around $35/month, but that pricing has since ended and it seems it's now up to $44/month. Unfortunately the wiring in my damned apartment is too garbage to do much better, and this is the cheapest pricing available here. I pay for 50mbps down, but actually get around 34. I pay $45 a month lol I'd happily trade up for that! OP stole the video.

French actually, the tank in the gif is a Renault FT, developed by the French and widely used by many of the allied powers during ww1, the insignia on the tank is used by the French for armoured vechicles. It increases the tank's velocity by small increments, overtime though this adds up.

God save us all lol Edit... I'll add this in case it gives anyone a laugh. Right around the time I saw big dog (years ago) I had been searching for robots/mechs around the world and had come across this guy as well... Lol... I present to you the Land Walker ! Again... 50 of those would be terrifying (on a flat surface) but they're so not sneaking up on you :) That's exactly why Boston Dynamics lost their DARPA contract. They couldn't figure how how to make the robots silent while still meeting the required specs. Did they try transmuting them with humans? That's probably classified. Think about it though. The videos you've seen are the unclassified ones. They almost certainly have better technology. Classified: https://youtu.be/CPkwbSW1Evg No worries just ask Hillary. Let me shoot over an email, hold for response I'll check on Wikileaks in a week. We didn't start a war with Ishval Iraq for human transmutation subjects, don't be crazy. Someone should cross reference sites of major battles with a pentagram to be sure. With the sheer amount of warfare that's happened in the world you probably could just by drawing one randomly and googling if there's been a battle at each point. [deleted] that's not a pentagram... that's Texas That's not a pentagram, that's a pentagon Somewhere in the distance, Nina cries daaaaddyyyy "ed.. oni.. chan" Ouch... you punched me right in that feels, man That's taboo! "AAAALLLLLLLLL" - Edward Elric Interesting... where can I read more about this? Was another company able to get the DARPA contract in their place? Google I guess. The assignment was to build a robotic load bearing platform that could accompany Rangers and such on recon missions. That meant something that could silently carry heavy loads long distances. Battery tech isn't advanced enough yet that the robots could manage the weight across long distances and combustion engines can't do so quietly. So the project got shelved. Battery technology is a huge bottleneck for progress in general. It's not really a failure on Boston Dynamics part, the conclusion was simply that it can't be done yet. Failure doesn't need to have such negative connotation around it. They absolutely failed at the assignment, but it's OK. Not really. Boston Dynamics could happily keep going. The robot works, there's room for improvement. The power source is outside the boundaries of their assignment, they just use what's available. They build a working robot that gets as close to the set criteria as possible. Not close enough for DARPA's needs. Rather than wait for battery tech to catch up, the contract was ended. This. I've been doing some reading on this topic for the past few hours. The original comment makes it seem like BD failed and couldn't produce something which is why they lost their contract. They didn't "lose" a contract. It was terminated due to technical limitations provided. VERY different, but I mean, who gives a fk on the internet right? That's still failure. That's the point Marty is making: failure isn't completely negative. it's short for Martin. The did still lose the contract. They had a contract, which was then terminated. ipso facto they lost it. A lost contract does not imply that someone else was contracted instead. i think boston dynamics actually was bought/absorbed by google, if i remember correctly. They were (and are currently for up for sale again) but that's an entirely different subject. No- they stopped working for DARPA shortly after being acquired by Google, as Google doesn't want DoD $$. However, they've kept developing their concepts, which appear to be both capable and silent (but no word on battery life..) Wow..that thing is straight out of Silent Hill, visually and aurally. Yikes. Super-cool, though. ...I would probably pee myself if that thing came up to me in the woods at night. I never had a fear of machines until the Big Dog video came out. Now it is all I think about. Despite the newer videos they've released, this one has always been my favorite due to the ice slipping clip. It's recovery looks 100% organic. I like the spot mini one, too: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7IEVTDjng They have it slip on some banana peels. Result is not quite as elegant the banana peel part is awesome. Does the same thing my actual dogs do when they fall - just sort of curl up in a shame ball before getting back up By using their articulated giraffe necks to push themselves up by their skulls. Adorable. your dogs dont do that? You feel so bad for the lil pupper when the bad man kicks it and then they film it slipping and falling :( The big dog looks like two people facing each other while carrying something really big and heavy on their shoulders Did you watch the parody?? Oh my God, how have I never seen that parody before, that is so funny. http://i.imgur.com/zwYkKtF.gifv Huh, maybe we shouldn't be worried about them taking over. HAHA THAT IS CORRECT, FELLOW HUMAN.

I AM SO SAD I FEAR SALT WATER WILL SOON EMANATE FROM EYE SENSORS BALLS. cue laugh track Bing Bang theme song begins playing In college, I had a project with a few friends where we built a robotic hand using shape-memory metals, specifically Nitinol (Nickel Titanium alloy). I don't know if the diaelectric elastomers are any better, but the problem is that to make such materials work, they are crazy thin usually. They often aren't all that strong, and if you want any amount of force behind them, you seem to be better off with the traditional servos and pneumatics. We even tried making "bundles" of these Nitinol wires to simulate a sort of "muscle" design (at like $500 a bundle) rather than just individual fibers, and it doesn't give you enough of an increase in strength to matter, especially because it made controlling individual temperature gradients of individual wires even harder which is key to fine dexterity. Maybe with more money someone else could make it work, I dunno, but this doesn't really seem like the "Holy Grail" described in that article if you want to create robots that can actually do any practice physical work. That move's called the bus-diver "Now watch me whip" "Now watch me..." ERROR Yeah! "You know what, robot? You get an A for effort." That was an oddly accurate description of how the hangover I woke up with yesterday felt. Chappie after a big night Looks like the years haven't been kind to buzz lightyear The things humanity can build and accomplish is simply extraordinary. The exceptionally complicated devices and pieces of technology we have developed in such a short span of time is incredible. Our species as a whole is so intelligent it boggles the mind. We are beyond impressive. And then sometimes we aren't. This is one of those times. I am not a programmer, but wouldn't you want some sort of if-then statement like "If I grab this material, but I don't feel it, then I don't execute the turning action" Especially considering this robot is worth more than my house The robot probably doesn't have pressure sensors in its hand, especially since that one is designed to work in fire fighting. couldn't it use spacial coordinates based on the amount of extension is in the fingers/arm? That would remove the need for pressure sensors Spacial coordinates doesn't let the robot know if it's grabbing something or not (feedback like that is actually pretty hard to implement, especially in such advanced robots). As far as this robot knows, it grabbed the wheel and did its job perfectly. Absolutely flawless You're thinking of standard programming, rather than AI. AI generally tries not to just tell it what to do in every situation, but to let it learn using things like genetic algorithms. You see a robot making a mistake, and that's what's happened. What's not pictured is the generic algorithm processing the failure and thousands of other failures and successes to learn what went wrong and what went right. It's going to learn how not to grasp the valve, and how not to stance itself in case the valve isn't there. And on successes, it will compare that and learn how to avoid failures. Tl;dr, without failures, it won't learn what not to do. So failures are okay. Turn down for what! #feelsbadman Those things fall over more than an infant and it's just as funny. Whipped so hard he died https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crg9t7NKvLo This just made me realize that Vine is just a more contemporary YTMND. Oh. Oh my god. Thank you Yooooo wtf was that robot baby Oh mai gawd Poor robot doggo. What's a robot doggo? A big ol' pupperbot What's a pupperbot? A tiny robot doggo FUCK.exe I think this may be my new favorite video. 1 second longer is all it would've taken *Spartans. There is but one "Master Chief." It's actually pluralized "Masters Chief", like mothers-in-law or Whoppers, Jr. Hey look, something else high school never taught me! Also those were Master Chief, Spartan Locke, and a SPARTAN-IV wearing Protector Variant MJOLNIR armor. Though technically they were all a bunch of nerdy goofballs. In theory the UNSC Navy would have many Master Chief Petty Officers, but only one who completed the Spartan program. Don't the branches of the military have a single highest ranking non commissioned officer, too? Like the Marines have a Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, so I'd assume the navy has an equivalent, A Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy or something. So maybe Master Chief isn't just a MCPO, maybe he's the MCPO? EDIT: got a thing wrong. This is in fact John's rank http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Chief_Petty_Officer_of_the_Navy He's basically an enlisted vice admiral https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXI4WWhPn-U I am so sad to say I didn't realize they were two dudes bending over until roughly 1 minute in. /r/nocontext Thank goodness I wasn't the only one... It was the kick that did it for me. Lmao, thanks for the laugh Ones actually Locke, not Master Chief I clicked the gif before reading the title and actually thought this is what it was. Only one of them is. The rest don't know though. quick, kick them in the chest!! "Oh my God, you know the thing!?" "I know the thing!" "Lets do the thing!!!" "Zhu Li, do the thing!" I'm afraid there are no more things to do but she ended up doing the thing for the rest of their lives :) I'm never not upvoting Zhu Li. Her and Verrick are what made the humor come back. Made it feel way more ATLA I really enjoyed Bumi too. I just finished that series the other day after putting it off since the first season. "We're walking in circles. I've seen that same Spirit Mushroom five times!" "That's not the same mushroom." "Yes I am" I say this all the time and no one gets it. I guess people on reddit, and /r/gaming , are geekier than the norm :) Then strap them down in front of a computer and leave them there until they've seen the whole thing. If I had gold to give, it would be yours for this Korra reference I use very often myself 😀👍 Numfar! Do the dance of joy! Reminds me of that episode of Dexters lab where he makes the dog talk Source And what its based on Source 2 This was the first one I saw.....I lost it. The cardio work out this must give. I'm jelly. I tried to do that walk in my room and came to the conclusion I have no rhythm or stamina that white guy didn't have any rhythm either, but didn't stop him from having a good time It's not just rhythm but what he's doing with his arms. He's not even matching what they're doing. He's just flapping them around. The more of these I watched, the more I think that his asynchronous movements were intentional. I just watched the other 3. I think it's intentional now. I thought that was the point? He's just doing his own thing but it works for him. I think it's the hat bouncing on his head and the big beard. Edit: I figured it out. It's that massive smile he has going on. https://media0.giphy.com/media/GanoN3G2lOUvu/giphy.gif I know that's sped up, but I'd really like to see the source for that. It's too hilarious not to. me irl For real, my shoulders burn just watching this. And my stomach. And my cheeks. How many cheeks? Two cheeks Turkish WHATS HAPPENIN WITH THEM CHEEKS, CHARLIE? Five cheeks, Turkish. ye said 2 cheeks 5 cheeks ago! Why are you jealous of a thing you could do right now? I think he's jealous because it's a thing he's unable to do This is correct. I could do it at thirty seconds tops. It just gets better the more I watch it. marlon webbs videos are all amazing Watermeeellllloooonnnnn Still one of the greatest vine compilations I've ever seen ... I just... I want that white guy to raise his arms. Is that too much to ask? :( I found it hilarious that the white dude was doing it completely different than the others. White people can't dance, you'll have to excuse him Looking forward to more of this dankness in the future. I really want to see /u/TheTerryCrews getting in on these video. The white guy never quite gets the arms moving right. I'm Tyrone! And FUCK this weakling lookin motherfucker! I'm here to fuck your wife! Long dick sty--- Will Source 3 ever come out? I lost it It's right there in your comment, though! I wanted it to be this I am sad. You gotta really admire the differences in technique. more like the white dude is just really bad at it. Nah cause the third guy comes in and he's got his own spin on it too It might be intentional? They clearly took care of detail. I think they would have caught that. Definitely intentional, but their attention to the tempo is actually really good. Someone was there with a metronome (or the song) making sure they were on tempo for every shot. I thought his was the funniest, tbh. Next to the main guy. And here's part 2 Ohmygod there's a part 3 And now part 4 hahahahaha girls only Somehow that's not as satisfying. It's the 'me too!' mentality. It's like that friend that repeats a joke everyone in the room just heard. it's not that as so much as i can see these girls doing it. with marion and his crew it's out of place. They're all part of the same crew, I believe. This is just a version with the girls only. I've seen at least one video with all of them. That being said, Marion and the white bearded dude just look way more hilarious doing this, hands down. they're out of sync for one but i think a lot of the funny comes from the faces which the girls aren't pulling off as well. i still like how their arms are up instead of down though. Her legs barely go up. I call bullshit This had potential, but their feet stomps usually don't match the beat. That's one of the cores of the videos, I think. Yep. Marion and the beardy white guy pull it off way better. First they ruined Ghostbusters and now this. They're not really pulling off the walk Part 5! Unspoken rule is that you must watch the entire thing if you click on it. You know the rules, and so do I. Favorite one so far! Well fuck both of you Part 4 when. It's already released: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxg9vACeqjU More As you wish. MORE http://i.imgur.com/UB9rTcS.gifv This is how I know it's almost Monday... I appreciate that they don't stray from formula At this point they can keep making them and I would never stop watching them. Well that explains everything, and nothing. Oh my god that's hilarious At 55 seconds when the dudes hat becomes enchanted I lost it. i cant see it try starting the video at 52 seconds, at about 53 seconds the white guy's hat starts bouncing on his head while miraculously not falling off completely. Saw it as well, it was pure gold. Wish he kept it going, because it was magical. How can you tell it's enchanted? Because of the way it is. That's pretty neat Remind me of this. Or this, if you're of the wild sort. the hell did I just watch A preview of tonight's nightmares. You're welcome. I was gonna say Is that Marlon Webb? Yep! Yep Marlon Webb is so goddamn funny. I got into watching Vine compilations recently and most stuff is already dragging on me pretty hard but his stuff is always hilarious. I like how he does social commentary without being a pretentious knob about it. His watermelone bits kill me My favorite one is when they break into the guys house to rob him and find out he's poor too. "Take these n**** come with us." Or "I got my eyes on you." It is my firm believe that there are some things that will always be funny, and silly walking is one of them Isn't there one that's like "when you and your friends have dates" that's similar to this? Thank you for posting the sauce, the music made it infinitely better! That source's source. I lost it when they got Tyrone in on it. Thats the sequel to the Source's Source. Happy happy joy joy This was funnier than the source. My street cred tells me. That White dude is to be feared. Always watch the one white dude in the midst of a bunch of black dudes. He did something to earn that shit. I too watch Dave Chappelle You mean like, talked to them & was a cool guy? The OG master chief is just too good at that. i like it ! Reminds me when a player and an invader do ridiculous gestures in a Dark Souls game, and then a 3rd shows up and joins in. VERY GOOD! HELLLLOOO! 5 minutes later. I'M SORRYYYY! Lmfao. THANK YOOUUU! Praise the sun! \[T]/ Praise the SSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!! One does not simply praise the sun. Don't ever praise me or my sun again. https://youtu.be/8I6fmvp37TU I was exploring in WoW once and I came across a Tauren and a Night Elf dancing at a crossroad in Mullgore, the Tauren starting place.

This is what I tell my wife all the time. 3" of fury is better than no inches. --- my gf That's what she said That's more physical activity than I thought was possible at a game convention. It makes me tired just watching that Made me sweaty. It made my knees weak. It made my arms heavy. It made me vomit on my sweater... Mom's spaghetti. It made me nervous. But what about on the surface? Nah, on the surface I looked calm and ready. To drop bombs Moms spaghetti? don't underestimate a skinny nerd full of Code Red. I was around his booth when master chief took his helmet off, and he was pretty handsome The skinny Master Chiefs legs are in danger of snapping. The heavy armor didn't increase that risk already? It's actually RTX! A little bit different than a gaming convention Is that a gamer mating ritual its like when dogs sniff each others booty holes except with people Spartan mating ritual Sounds like an oxymoron Master Chief was always socially awkward... This has to be so exhausting. In a hot convention with a suit on? Definitely That woman's reaction was the best part. A perfect mix of confusion and amusement. The best part is that was at RTX and the people in yellow shirts were the guardians volunteering there to make sure things went smoothly, she's just doing her job and bam that happens haha Confusement This girl is actually a member in an organization I'm in at my school. She wasn't a guardian last year but always told me stories about how she hung out with them. I was so jealous when I found out she was one this year!! "This is weird, but not the weirdest thing I've seen all weekend." I was really hoping to see a continuing congo line. Hey this is at RTX! Yeah it is! I was there this year. Did you get to go? I did and I can't believe I didn't see this happen while I was there. I saw these two Spartans in the hall but how did I miss this?! I made it, bringing my million dollars but game was the best idea I ever had, played it in 4-5 lines. Lotta money. I've really tried, but I can't for the life of me make sense of this sentence. "Million Dollars But..." is a card game where you try to come up with ridiculous scenarios for your friends to do for a million dollars. At RTX each panel had like a 1-3 hour line so you had a lot of time to kill and the card game was actually invented specifically "for people to have something to do in lines at RTX" Mate! You deserve a trophy. Thanks for making me less clueless. are their legs ridiculously skinny or is it just the black leggings? edit: grammar I think they must be pretty tall, and probably don't squat, or maybe the armour is thinner than it looks. yeah, very lanky The first one is lanky as fuck. Yeah they're all tall and lanky dudes. One was my roommate and I promise he's never done a squat in his life. how much does he weigh? like 110? 120 tops? holy crap. I'm just surprised because to have that little muscle mass must mean that he barely moves. Probably doesn't help with the apparent size that they're wearing the costumes with large plastic armor plates. It's probably actually foam, not plastic. That's how most of these Spartan armour sets are made. Kinda like a large scale papercraft, except using sheets of sturdy yet lightweight foam. that's what i thought at first too, but compare the guy in the orange helmet with the other cosplayers and then also compare his thighs WITH armor with the girl in the blue jeans.

I'm more confused Me too I love the third guy in yellow that just seems to join in at the end I like to think he's not with them, just saw them dancing and joined in.

Yeah, someone always says that a dog has a disease or fucked up when they do silly things like this. My dogs are 100% healthy but do silly dances if I scratch their back or if I have treats and they get super excited. Normal dogs DO THIS. I've owned akitas. They arent normal dogs. Now you made me feel bad for laughing and singing "HUMBAYALA HUMBAYALA HUMBAYALA" in a chant to the dog's moving. You're awesome! Im hoping this continues and we get a whole line of happy dancing loons Imagine if everyone at gaming conventions walked like this Everyone would be fit as fuck But no one would fit Everyone would be lanky as fuck ftfy Are their movements a shout out to Marlin webs video? Marlin Webb 'take on me' video thing not sure I've seen that kinda thing before this (other than some really old school cartoons or something) That was the absolute best thing I've seen. Holy crap!

Check r/all to see if there have been any more large-scale tragedies since last time I checked, because I feel like there must've been. I feel so down, it's got to be a disturbance in the force, right? It can't just be all in me. See this post. Laugh with unexpected joy. Laugh til I cry. Cry it all out, like sudden diarrhea of the soul. Takes like three minutes. Some of that time pushing just to be sure, as one does. It's all out. There's nothing left but a faint warmth and (finally) the ability to sleep. This isn't what I came here for, but this is what I come here for. Sleep tight man, everything's all good. You've earned it. As long as you came it's all that matters. Get back to work. Fantastic post Take care and be good to yourself. Hang in there.

One girl for 2 seconds. Your hormones are all over the place, aren't they? I thought he meant the looks she gives the dancing peeps. At this time of year, definitely. mating season? Already? 2 seconds is all he needs Wow this is a real treat. Weve stumbled upon two wild spartans performing a mating dance. Its incredibly rare to find a pair of these creatures in the wild since they are usually very secluded animals. Watch as they meet up in the middle of the area here. You can see after they get close enough, one initiates the process with a distinctive wave and the other accepts. Now they follow one another to their final mating place, or what we like to call "getting a room". We best leave them be now. Wouldnt want to disturb the process of these beautiful creatures. It has to be so akward once they stop that This is basically how I've made my friends. The guys limbs in the Chief costume look so...unnatural. The third guy that joins them absolutely slayed me. So good. "Oh boy oh boy" Looks about right. so catchy even Bumblebee has to join in. TAAAAAAKE I'd be able to do this for maybe a minute before I get tired and have to stop. This is the most beautiful GIF I've ever seen. Is there an entire video of this pls? Master Chief on the left has some sick moves Well this is a great video to wake up to For a second I thought I was watching another Japanese robot demonstration Ooga ooga! This just made me soo happy, it's kinda adorable. I was seriously hoping for more to join in. Does this work in real life? If its better with sound, why link a gif?

They've come a long day, I remember their earlier big dog video and the parody someone made lol. I can just imagine being on the battlefield and hearing 50 of those things coming my way..... God save us all lol Edit... I'll add this in case it gives anyone a laugh. Right around the time I saw big dog (years ago) I had been searching for robots/mechs around the world and had come across this guy as well... Lol... I present to you the Land Walker ! Again... 50 of those would be terrifying (on a flat surface) but they're so not sneaking up on you :) That's exactly why Boston Dynamics lost their DARPA contract. They couldn't figure how how to make the robots silent while still meeting the required specs. Did they try transmuting them with humans? That's probably classified. Think about it though. The videos you've seen are the unclassified ones. They almost certainly have better technology. Classified: https://youtu.be/CPkwbSW1Evg No worries just ask Hillary. Let me shoot over an email, hold for response I'll check on Wikileaks in a week. We didn't start a war with Ishval Iraq for human transmutation subjects, don't be crazy. Someone should cross reference sites of major battles with a pentagram to be sure. With the sheer amount of warfare that's happened in the world you probably could just by drawing one randomly and googling if there's been a battle at each point. [deleted] that's not a pentagram... that's Texas That's not a pentagram, that's a pentagon Somewhere in the distance, Nina cries daaaaddyyyy "ed.. oni.. chan" Ouch... you punched me right in that feels, man That's taboo! "AAAALLLLLLLLL" - Edward Elric Interesting... where can I read more about this? Was another company able to get the DARPA contract in their place? Google I guess. The assignment was to build a robotic load bearing platform that could accompany Rangers and such on recon missions. That meant something that could silently carry heavy loads long distances. Battery tech isn't advanced enough yet that the robots could manage the weight across long distances and combustion engines can't do so quietly. So the project got shelved. Battery technology is a huge bottleneck for progress in general. It's not really a failure on Boston Dynamics part, the conclusion was simply that it can't be done yet. Failure doesn't need to have such negative connotation around it. They absolutely failed at the assignment, but it's OK. Not really. Boston Dynamics could happily keep going. The robot works, there's room for improvement. The power source is outside the boundaries of their assignment, they just use what's available. They build a working robot that gets as close to the set criteria as possible. Not close enough for DARPA's needs. Rather than wait for battery tech to catch up, the contract was ended. This. I've been doing some reading on this topic for the past few hours. The original comment makes it seem like BD failed and couldn't produce something which is why they lost their contract. They didn't "lose" a contract. It was terminated due to technical limitations provided. VERY different, but I mean, who gives a fk on the internet right? That's still failure. That's the point Marty is making: failure isn't completely negative. it's short for Martin. The did still lose the contract. They had a contract, which was then terminated. ipso facto they lost it. A lost contract does not imply that someone else was contracted instead. i think boston dynamics actually was bought/absorbed by google, if i remember correctly. They were (and are currently for up for sale again) but that's an entirely different subject. No- they stopped working for DARPA shortly after being acquired by Google, as Google doesn't want DoD $$. However, they've kept developing their concepts, which appear to be both capable and silent (but no word on battery life..) Wow..that thing is straight out of Silent Hill, visually and aurally. Yikes. Super-cool, though. ...I would probably pee myself if that thing came up to me in the woods at night. I never had a fear of machines until the Big Dog video came out. Now it is all I think about. Despite the newer videos they've released, this one has always been my favorite due to the ice slipping clip. It's recovery looks 100% organic. I like the spot mini one, too: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7IEVTDjng They have it slip on some banana peels. Result is not quite as elegant the banana peel part is awesome. Does the same thing my actual dogs do when they fall - just sort of curl up in a shame ball before getting back up By using their articulated giraffe necks to push themselves up by their skulls. Adorable. your dogs dont do that? You feel so bad for the lil pupper when the bad man kicks it and then they film it slipping and falling :( The big dog looks like two people facing each other while carrying something really big and heavy on their shoulders Did you watch the parody?? Oh my God, how have I never seen that parody before, that is so funny. http://i.imgur.com/zwYkKtF.gifv Huh, maybe we shouldn't be worried about them taking over. HAHA THAT IS CORRECT, FELLOW HUMAN.

I AM SO SAD I FEAR SALT WATER WILL SOON EMANATE FROM EYE SENSORS BALLS. cue laugh track Bing Bang theme song begins playing In college, I had a project with a few friends where we built a robotic hand using shape-memory metals, specifically Nitinol (Nickel Titanium alloy). I don't know if the diaelectric elastomers are any better, but the problem is that to make such materials work, they are crazy thin usually. They often aren't all that strong, and if you want any amount of force behind them, you seem to be better off with the traditional servos and pneumatics. We even tried making "bundles" of these Nitinol wires to simulate a sort of "muscle" design (at like $500 a bundle) rather than just individual fibers, and it doesn't give you enough of an increase in strength to matter, especially because it made controlling individual temperature gradients of individual wires even harder which is key to fine dexterity. Maybe with more money someone else could make it work, I dunno, but this doesn't really seem like the "Holy Grail" described in that article if you want to create robots that can actually do any practice physical work. That move's called the bus-diver "Now watch me whip" "Now watch me..." ERROR Yeah! "You know what, robot? You get an A for effort." That was an oddly accurate description of how the hangover I woke up with yesterday felt. Chappie after a big night Looks like the years haven't been kind to buzz lightyear The things humanity can build and accomplish is simply extraordinary. The exceptionally complicated devices and pieces of technology we have developed in such a short span of time is incredible. Our species as a whole is so intelligent it boggles the mind. We are beyond impressive. And then sometimes we aren't. This is one of those times. I am not a programmer, but wouldn't you want some sort of if-then statement like "If I grab this material, but I don't feel it, then I don't execute the turning action" Especially considering this robot is worth more than my house The robot probably doesn't have pressure sensors in its hand, especially since that one is designed to work in fire fighting. couldn't it use spacial coordinates based on the amount of extension is in the fingers/arm? That would remove the need for pressure sensors Spacial coordinates doesn't let the robot know if it's grabbing something or not (feedback like that is actually pretty hard to implement, especially in such advanced robots). As far as this robot knows, it grabbed the wheel and did its job perfectly. Absolutely flawless You're thinking of standard programming, rather than AI. AI generally tries not to just tell it what to do in every situation, but to let it learn using things like genetic algorithms. You see a robot making a mistake, and that's what's happened. What's not pictured is the generic algorithm processing the failure and thousands of other failures and successes to learn what went wrong and what went right. It's going to learn how not to grasp the valve, and how not to stance itself in case the valve isn't there. And on successes, it will compare that and learn how to avoid failures. Tl;dr, without failures, it won't learn what not to do. So failures are okay. Turn down for what! #feelsbadman Those things fall over more than an infant and it's just as funny.

It's actually pluralized "Masters Chief", like mothers-in-law or Whoppers, Jr. Hey look, something else high school never taught me! Also those were Master Chief, Spartan Locke, and a SPARTAN-IV wearing Protector Variant MJOLNIR armor. Though technically they were all a bunch of nerdy goofballs. In theory the UNSC Navy would have many Master Chief Petty Officers, but only one who completed the Spartan program. Don't the branches of the military have a single highest ranking non commissioned officer, too? Like the Marines have a Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, so I'd assume the navy has an equivalent, A Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy or something. So maybe Master Chief isn't just a MCPO, maybe he's the MCPO? EDIT: got a thing wrong. This is in fact John's rank http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Chief_Petty_Officer_of_the_Navy He's basically an enlisted vice admiral https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXI4WWhPn-U I am so sad to say I didn't realize they were two dudes bending over until roughly 1 minute in. /r/nocontext Thank goodness I wasn't the only one... It was the kick that did it for me. Lmao, thanks for the laugh Ones actually Locke, not Master Chief I clicked the gif before reading the title and actually thought this is what it was. Only one of them is. The rest don't know though. quick, kick them in the chest!! That's exactly why Boston Dynamics lost their DARPA contract. They couldn't figure how how to make the robots silent while still meeting the required specs. Did they try transmuting them with humans? That's probably classified. Think about it though. The videos you've seen are the unclassified ones. They almost certainly have better technology. Classified: https://youtu.be/CPkwbSW1Evg No worries just ask Hillary. Let me shoot over an email, hold for response I'll check on Wikileaks in a week. We didn't start a war with Ishval Iraq for human transmutation subjects, don't be crazy. Someone should cross reference sites of major battles with a pentagram to be sure. With the sheer amount of warfare that's happened in the world you probably could just by drawing one randomly and googling if there's been a battle at each point.

"AAAALLLLLLLLL" - Edward Elric Interesting... where can I read more about this? Was another company able to get the DARPA contract in their place? Google I guess. The assignment was to build a robotic load bearing platform that could accompany Rangers and such on recon missions. That meant something that could silently carry heavy loads long distances. Battery tech isn't advanced enough yet that the robots could manage the weight across long distances and combustion engines can't do so quietly. So the project got shelved. Battery technology is a huge bottleneck for progress in general. It's not really a failure on Boston Dynamics part, the conclusion was simply that it can't be done yet. Failure doesn't need to have such negative connotation around it. They absolutely failed at the assignment, but it's OK. Not really. Boston Dynamics could happily keep going. The robot works, there's room for improvement. The power source is outside the boundaries of their assignment, they just use what's available. They build a working robot that gets as close to the set criteria as possible. Not close enough for DARPA's needs. Rather than wait for battery tech to catch up, the contract was ended. This. I've been doing some reading on this topic for the past few hours. The original comment makes it seem like BD failed and couldn't produce something which is why they lost their contract. They didn't "lose" a contract. It was terminated due to technical limitations provided. VERY different, but I mean, who gives a fk on the internet right? That's still failure. That's the point Marty is making: failure isn't completely negative. it's short for Martin. The did still lose the contract. They had a contract, which was then terminated. ipso facto they lost it. A lost contract does not imply that someone else was contracted instead. i think boston dynamics actually was bought/absorbed by google, if i remember correctly. They were (and are currently for up for sale again) but that's an entirely different subject. No- they stopped working for DARPA shortly after being acquired by Google, as Google doesn't want DoD $$. However, they've kept developing their concepts, which appear to be both capable and silent (but no word on battery life..) Wow..that thing is straight out of Silent Hill, visually and aurally. Yikes. Super-cool, though. ...I would probably pee myself if that thing came up to me in the woods at night. I never had a fear of machines until the Big Dog video came out. Now it is all I think about. Despite the newer videos they've released, this one has always been my favorite due to the ice slipping clip. It's recovery looks 100% organic. I like the spot mini one, too: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7IEVTDjng They have it slip on some banana peels. Result is not quite as elegant the banana peel part is awesome. Does the same thing my actual dogs do when they fall - just sort of curl up in a shame ball before getting back up By using their articulated giraffe necks to push themselves up by their skulls. Adorable. your dogs dont do that? You feel so bad for the lil pupper when the bad man kicks it and then they film it slipping and falling :( The big dog looks like two people facing each other while carrying something really big and heavy on their shoulders Did you watch the parody??

I AM SO SAD I FEAR SALT WATER WILL SOON EMANATE FROM EYE SENSORS BALLS. cue laugh track Bing Bang theme song begins playing In college, I had a project with a few friends where we built a robotic hand using shape-memory metals, specifically Nitinol (Nickel Titanium alloy). I don't know if the diaelectric elastomers are any better, but the problem is that to make such materials work, they are crazy thin usually. They often aren't all that strong, and if you want any amount of force behind them, you seem to be better off with the traditional servos and pneumatics. We even tried making "bundles" of these Nitinol wires to simulate a sort of "muscle" design (at like $500 a bundle) rather than just individual fibers, and it doesn't give you enough of an increase in strength to matter, especially because it made controlling individual temperature gradients of individual wires even harder which is key to fine dexterity. Maybe with more money someone else could make it work, I dunno, but this doesn't really seem like the "Holy Grail" described in that article if you want to create robots that can actually do any practice physical work. That move's called the bus-diver "Now watch me whip" "Now watch me..." ERROR Yeah! "You know what, robot? You get an A for effort." That was an oddly accurate description of how the hangover I woke up with yesterday felt. Chappie after a big night Looks like the years haven't been kind to buzz lightyear The things humanity can build and accomplish is simply extraordinary. The exceptionally complicated devices and pieces of technology we have developed in such a short span of time is incredible. Our species as a whole is so intelligent it boggles the mind. We are beyond impressive. And then sometimes we aren't. This is one of those times. I am not a programmer, but wouldn't you want some sort of if-then statement like "If I grab this material, but I don't feel it, then I don't execute the turning action" Especially considering this robot is worth more than my house The robot probably doesn't have pressure sensors in its hand, especially since that one is designed to work in fire fighting. couldn't it use spacial coordinates based on the amount of extension is in the fingers/arm? That would remove the need for pressure sensors Spacial coordinates doesn't let the robot know if it's grabbing something or not (feedback like that is actually pretty hard to implement, especially in such advanced robots). As far as this robot knows, it grabbed the wheel and did its job perfectly. Absolutely flawless You're thinking of standard programming, rather than AI. AI generally tries not to just tell it what to do in every situation, but to let it learn using things like genetic algorithms. You see a robot making a mistake, and that's what's happened. What's not pictured is the generic algorithm processing the failure and thousands of other failures and successes to learn what went wrong and what went right. It's going to learn how not to grasp the valve, and how not to stance itself in case the valve isn't there. And on successes, it will compare that and learn how to avoid failures. Tl;dr, without failures, it won't learn what not to do. So failures are okay. Turn down for what! #feelsbadman Those things fall over more than an infant and it's just as funny.

I don't know if the diaelectric elastomers are any better, but the problem is that to make such materials work, they are crazy thin usually. They often aren't all that strong, and if you want any amount of force behind them, you seem to be better off with the traditional servos and pneumatics. We even tried making "bundles" of these Nitinol wires to simulate a sort of "muscle" design (at like $500 a bundle) rather than just individual fibers, and it doesn't give you enough of an increase in strength to matter, especially because it made controlling individual temperature gradients of individual wires even harder which is key to fine dexterity. Maybe with more money someone else could make it work, I dunno, but this doesn't really seem like the "Holy Grail" described in that article if you want to create robots that can actually do any practice physical work.

ERROR Yeah! The robot probably doesn't have pressure sensors in its hand, especially since that one is designed to work in fire fighting. couldn't it use spacial coordinates based on the amount of extension is in the fingers/arm? That would remove the need for pressure sensors Spacial coordinates doesn't let the robot know if it's grabbing something or not (feedback like that is actually pretty hard to implement, especially in such advanced robots). As far as this robot knows, it grabbed the wheel and did its job perfectly. Absolutely flawless You're thinking of standard programming, rather than AI. AI generally tries not to just tell it what to do in every situation, but to let it learn using things like genetic algorithms. You see a robot making a mistake, and that's what's happened. What's not pictured is the generic algorithm processing the failure and thousands of other failures and successes to learn what went wrong and what went right. It's going to learn how not to grasp the valve, and how not to stance itself in case the valve isn't there. And on successes, it will compare that and learn how to avoid failures. Tl;dr, without failures, it won't learn what not to do. So failures are okay. couldn't it use spacial coordinates based on the amount of extension is in the fingers/arm?

Also those were Master Chief, Spartan Locke, and a SPARTAN-IV wearing Protector Variant MJOLNIR armor. Though technically they were all a bunch of nerdy goofballs. In theory the UNSC Navy would have many Master Chief Petty Officers, but only one who completed the Spartan program. Don't the branches of the military have a single highest ranking non commissioned officer, too? Like the Marines have a Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, so I'd assume the navy has an equivalent, A Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy or something. So maybe Master Chief isn't just a MCPO, maybe he's the MCPO? EDIT: got a thing wrong. This is in fact John's rank http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Chief_Petty_Officer_of_the_Navy He's basically an enlisted vice admiral Hey look, something else high school never taught me!

I'm afraid there are no more things to do but she ended up doing the thing for the rest of their lives :) I'm never not upvoting Zhu Li. Her and Verrick are what made the humor come back. Made it feel way more ATLA I really enjoyed Bumi too. I just finished that series the other day after putting it off since the first season. "We're walking in circles. I've seen that same Spirit Mushroom five times!" "That's not the same mushroom." "Yes I am" I say this all the time and no one gets it. I guess people on reddit, and /r/gaming , are geekier than the norm :) Then strap them down in front of a computer and leave them there until they've seen the whole thing. If I had gold to give, it would be yours for this Korra reference I use very often myself 😀👍 Numfar! Do the dance of joy!

And what its based on Source 2 This was the first one I saw.....I lost it. The cardio work out this must give. I'm jelly. I tried to do that walk in my room and came to the conclusion I have no rhythm or stamina that white guy didn't have any rhythm either, but didn't stop him from having a good time It's not just rhythm but what he's doing with his arms. He's not even matching what they're doing. He's just flapping them around. The more of these I watched, the more I think that his asynchronous movements were intentional. I just watched the other 3. I think it's intentional now. I thought that was the point? He's just doing his own thing but it works for him. I think it's the hat bouncing on his head and the big beard. Edit: I figured it out. It's that massive smile he has going on. https://media0.giphy.com/media/GanoN3G2lOUvu/giphy.gif I know that's sped up, but I'd really like to see the source for that. It's too hilarious not to. me irl For real, my shoulders burn just watching this. And my stomach. And my cheeks. How many cheeks? Two cheeks Turkish WHATS HAPPENIN WITH THEM CHEEKS, CHARLIE? Five cheeks, Turkish. ye said 2 cheeks 5 cheeks ago! Why are you jealous of a thing you could do right now? I think he's jealous because it's a thing he's unable to do This is correct. I could do it at thirty seconds tops. It just gets better the more I watch it. marlon webbs videos are all amazing Watermeeellllloooonnnnn Still one of the greatest vine compilations I've ever seen ... I just... I want that white guy to raise his arms. Is that too much to ask? :( I found it hilarious that the white dude was doing it completely different than the others. White people can't dance, you'll have to excuse him Looking forward to more of this dankness in the future. I really want to see /u/TheTerryCrews getting in on these video. The white guy never quite gets the arms moving right. I'm Tyrone! And FUCK this weakling lookin motherfucker! I'm here to fuck your wife! Long dick sty--- Will Source 3 ever come out? I lost it It's right there in your comment, though! I wanted it to be this I am sad. You gotta really admire the differences in technique. more like the white dude is just really bad at it. Nah cause the third guy comes in and he's got his own spin on it too It might be intentional? They clearly took care of detail. I think they would have caught that. Definitely intentional, but their attention to the tempo is actually really good. Someone was there with a metronome (or the song) making sure they were on tempo for every shot. I thought his was the funniest, tbh. Next to the main guy. And here's part 2 Ohmygod there's a part 3 And now part 4 hahahahaha girls only Somehow that's not as satisfying. It's the 'me too!' mentality. It's like that friend that repeats a joke everyone in the room just heard. it's not that as so much as i can see these girls doing it. with marion and his crew it's out of place. They're all part of the same crew, I believe. This is just a version with the girls only. I've seen at least one video with all of them. That being said, Marion and the white bearded dude just look way more hilarious doing this, hands down. they're out of sync for one but i think a lot of the funny comes from the faces which the girls aren't pulling off as well. i still like how their arms are up instead of down though. Her legs barely go up. I call bullshit This had potential, but their feet stomps usually don't match the beat. That's one of the cores of the videos, I think. Yep. Marion and the beardy white guy pull it off way better. First they ruined Ghostbusters and now this. They're not really pulling off the walk Part 5! Unspoken rule is that you must watch the entire thing if you click on it. You know the rules, and so do I. Favorite one so far! Well fuck both of you Part 4 when. It's already released: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxg9vACeqjU More As you wish. MORE http://i.imgur.com/UB9rTcS.gifv This is how I know it's almost Monday... I appreciate that they don't stray from formula At this point they can keep making them and I would never stop watching them. Well that explains everything, and nothing. Oh my god that's hilarious At 55 seconds when the dudes hat becomes enchanted I lost it. i cant see it try starting the video at 52 seconds, at about 53 seconds the white guy's hat starts bouncing on his head while miraculously not falling off completely. Saw it as well, it was pure gold. Wish he kept it going, because it was magical. How can you tell it's enchanted? Because of the way it is. That's pretty neat Remind me of this. Or this, if you're of the wild sort. the hell did I just watch A preview of tonight's nightmares. You're welcome. I was gonna say Is that Marlon Webb? Yep! Yep Marlon Webb is so goddamn funny. I got into watching Vine compilations recently and most stuff is already dragging on me pretty hard but his stuff is always hilarious. I like how he does social commentary without being a pretentious knob about it. His watermelone bits kill me My favorite one is when they break into the guys house to rob him and find out he's poor too. "Take these n**** come with us." Or "I got my eyes on you." It is my firm believe that there are some things that will always be funny, and silly walking is one of them Isn't there one that's like "when you and your friends have dates" that's similar to this? Thank you for posting the sauce, the music made it infinitely better! That source's source. I lost it when they got Tyrone in on it. Thats the sequel to the Source's Source. Happy happy joy joy This was funnier than the source. My street cred tells me. That White dude is to be feared. Always watch the one white dude in the midst of a bunch of black dudes. He did something to earn that shit. I too watch Dave Chappelle You mean like, talked to them & was a cool guy? The OG master chief is just too good at that. i like it !

Spartan mating ritual In a hot convention with a suit on? Definitely The best part is that was at RTX and the people in yellow shirts were the guardians volunteering there to make sure things went smoothly, she's just doing her job and bam that happens haha Confusement This girl is actually a member in an organization I'm in at my school. She wasn't a guardian last year but always told me stories about how she hung out with them. I was so jealous when I found out she was one this year!! "This is weird, but not the weirdest thing I've seen all weekend." Yeah it is! I was there this year. Did you get to go? I did and I can't believe I didn't see this happen while I was there. I saw these two Spartans in the hall but how did I miss this?! I made it, bringing my million dollars but game was the best idea I ever had, played it in 4-5 lines. Lotta money. I've really tried, but I can't for the life of me make sense of this sentence. "Million Dollars But..." is a card game where you try to come up with ridiculous scenarios for your friends to do for a million dollars. At RTX each panel had like a 1-3 hour line so you had a lot of time to kill and the card game was actually invented specifically "for people to have something to do in lines at RTX" Mate! You deserve a trophy. Thanks for making me less clueless. I did and I can't believe I didn't see this happen while I was there. I saw these two Spartans in the hall but how did I miss this?!

I think they must be pretty tall, and probably don't squat, or maybe the armour is thinner than it looks. yeah, very lanky The first one is lanky as fuck. Yeah they're all tall and lanky dudes. One was my roommate and I promise he's never done a squat in his life. how much does he weigh? like 110? 120 tops? holy crap. I'm just surprised because to have that little muscle mass must mean that he barely moves. Probably doesn't help with the apparent size that they're wearing the costumes with large plastic armor plates. It's probably actually foam, not plastic. That's how most of these Spartan armour sets are made. Kinda like a large scale papercraft, except using sheets of sturdy yet lightweight foam. that's what i thought at first too, but compare the guy in the orange helmet with the other cosplayers and then also compare his thighs WITH armor with the girl in the blue jeans. His thighs WITH armor are still thinner. yeah, very lanky how much does he weigh? like 110? 120 tops? holy crap.

Chief spotted his dear dear friend Jameson Locke from across the room and they decided to reminisce about all their great times together. Yes Well, I'm never gonna unsee that.

Already? Already? "What 'celebrity' shall we call, to make a 1 minute advert with good CGI, followed by 2 seconds of game footage....on a tablet that's filmed from far away?" It's always the same base/tower defense game too, just reskinned. Yet people keep playing them. I don't blame the developers/marketers. I don't blame the developers that make those games, I see tons of people playing slot machine games on their phones so the bar is set pretty low. I do wish I could find a single decent mobile game through all the shit, though. I have pretty much given up on mobile gaming, I just emulate SNES and Game boy games because at least I know they will entertain me without trying to con me into spending fucktons of money on bullshit. One guy with money, invited me, the guy with coding skills, to make the games he couldn't find for his children (he had a 3 year old boy and a just-born girl). We made good games, no ads, no microtransactions, and so on. Reviews from specialized media, and the public, were usually above 4.5 (my guess is that our average across all games is 4.7) Yet... we didn't sold much, and while looking for our own games in the store, we finally found lots of other good ones. We found out that what is going on, is that the games that get in the "top list" or are scammy (many lists are organized by earning/time, and a good way to hit the top, is do outright scammy things, for example a popular game in my country had invisible banners, thus it racked millions in fraudulent money and shoot up to the first spot... Apple then returned all the advertisers money, and banned the guy from the store, but he was already famous after hitting the first spot, and the clones of his game became a new genre of sorts) or they belong to companies that are media, or have connections with media (example: my biggest competitors were Disney, that has connections with media, and Toca-Boca, that is owned by a multi-billion sized media company named Bonnier Group). Or they had friends on Google and Apple HQ (the HQ! I for example had a Google Brazil employee talk to us, review our game formally, recommend for the HQ to put it in the recommended front page, yet we never made it, instead lots of shitty stuff made it, that had authors that were ex Google HQ employees or friends of Google HQ employees). So... we gave up, the games are still up, and sometimes we update them, but it is not profitable the effort to make good games, at least not without deep media connections, and since we don't have those... (if you are curious: http://www.kidoteca.com) Why not start a mobile game review website dedicated to finding quality games? That's the part of the ecosystem that we're missing. There's no good "app/game review" website that's ubiquitous. I would use this. It's hard finding actual games for mobile. What a shame. I'm sorry you couldn't attain the success you deserved for being willing to stray from the pack. That kind of attitude should always be rewarded. Try Auralux, Pocket Mortys, and Evil Apples. Also you can play the entirety of Knights of the Old Republic on your phone so Fart of the Poopy is good, too. I like Diddle of the Pokemans try Pixel Dungeon What's up with that game? I download it, try it, can't get past the 3rd floor of the first level, get mad and uninstall it. Like is it just me or is that game really fucking hard? It's a roguelike game, they tend to be pretty tricky. Try using the wiki, trial and error. The genre is not for everyone. Its a rougelike so yeah its really hard. You're supposed to play it over and over again and get a bit further every time. The most important part is to never go to the next level before you have explored pretty much everything on the level you are at, because you need everything you find to survive later. Puzzle and Dragons is a top tier mobile game (just hit 1000 days) that you can progress forever in without spending a dollar. Oh, seriously? I saw all their ads and it looked like one of those shitty "match 3" clones that are everywhere think of it more as a match 3 RPG game with elements similar to pokemon and that's pretty much what puzzles and dragons is Not that it's a guarantee of quality, but it does have 2 3DS games. And, apparently, an anime. So... yeah. Is this one of those "you could theoretically go on forever for free, but practically speaking all of the high level content is time gated behind ridiculous timers unless you spend real money"? Ooh, I only need 1,000 Potato points for this final tier power, but free players only get a 33% chance at one potato per day... I wonder how much budget goes into advertising versus actual game. Enough to impress me that they make that much money for those kinds of advertising. Every game I've seen with a high budget commercial like that then stayed number 1 on the app store for quite a while [deleted] What? No no no, commercials work by subconsciously subverting your free will and tricking you into giving your money to some shadowy company. I learned that on Reddit. smoke. Are you smoking yet?? I still can't believe Arnold agreed to basically be the face of a game like Mobile Strike. Money must be tight. the former governor of California is the face of a mobile phone game. Just think about that They probably paid him $1 million and only need to turn up for 1 day of shooting. Even if you already have $100m, it would be tempting. If I had $100m I would still feel stupid if I didn't do a day's worth of work for another million There is not much I wouldn't do for 1 million :/ Can we get Sandra Bullock to endorse Diddle of Sadness? That was me when she took off her wildcats sweater in Speed One with big tits. Don't forget "saga" at the end of it. Also relevant. > 5 million Downloads ಠ_ಠ To be fair, lots of people buy downloads to boost their popularity on the app stores these days for free games along with positive reviews that are like 1 liner 5 star reviews. Google said they have 1.4 billion Android users, while Apple has at something around 500m. To be fairer, publishers put ads in their previous hit game about their new game Doing this costs nothing You're right. But they go far beyond that. Download the new game and get X premium currency/one time loot rewards! how I'm pretty sure that there's some sort of sketchy Chinese pay-to-download shenanigans in the Play Store I'm not so sure, there are 1+ billion active Android devices, so a free game downloaded by 5+ million people is more than possible, though probably most people just download it and delete it within 2 minutes. Where did you get 1+ billion devices? Genuinely interested, that's pretty staggering I'm not them, but here's something from Google from a year ago saying there's 1.4 billion active Android devices.

Honestly the line between bootleg and "real" games is so blurry now. I remember it used to be NES games at the flea market with sprites/text clumsily swapped out; now it's pretty much entire high-quality games built from the ground up but they're still called "Man Of BartleMdoernWar 2 Kart". [deleted] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU6WC4dpaHM Ah yes Call of Modern War: Warfare Duty The game where you go to your 9-5 job as a subcontractor for the military monitoring drones. This is the story of a soldier named Stanley. Stanley worked for the military in a big building where he was Soldier #427. Soldier #427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a joystick. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buildings to blow up, when to blow them up, and in what order. This is what Soldier #427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy. And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley; something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi.' Never in all his years in the military had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office. And then was shot by the enemy drone operator The flying kind or the office kind? Drone Dronefare This one sounds good as well. And all those idiots naming everything flappy, crossy or angry thinking their is going to sell because of that thinking They do sell. It's mostly because the title generates the most weight on search traffic. It's why you will see loaded app titles with a ton of keywords in them. And believe me it works. When the app is in front of more people chances are it'll be downloaded more. That's just how it is. >5 million downloads.

Diddle of Poopy [deleted] Attack on Poopy I remember when the app store was filled with all these neat little games in the first 2-3 years of its inception. Then IAP became a thing and it all went to shit. Relevant call of duty. Am i doin this right?

Launch of the Poopy Angry Turds Why is this so far down? Was getting so hopeful that no one else thought of that. Fart of Betrayal is actually has a good mix of horror and suspense elements.

I'd play Diddle Wizard. Diddle the Wizard I put on my robe and wizard hat You need the middle part...though "Diddle of the Wizzard" sounds like a very different game "Clash Attack of War Someshit" Sometimes funny, sometimes emotional, always gritty, this instant classic (lol, marketing) from the same studio that brought us "Frustrating Puzzle Thing Damn" follows generic protagonist Guy Armiguy as he resolves a war that he honestly couldn't care or know less about. We were not originally sold play testing a recent press demo of the title, but once we saw our hero shrug and casually walk past the first level boss because he (and we quote), "don't need this shit today", we were hooked. The graphics are ... okay. We don't remember the soundtrack. What really stuck out in our minds was the scene where Guy tells the UN Security Council, "Damnit, can't you fuckers just stop with the war bullshit already? I got shit to do." Rating: M for "meh" Score: 4/5 Shrugs (We have that one guy who's really into this kind of thing. You know the type. Overly enthusiastic, likes everything and everyone, can't think of a way to insult a woman who looks like Terry Crews but with a mustache, while she mugs him with her fists. This actually happened. Our office manager, Sue, voted "Shrug".) Developer Quote: "Fine, fine, FINE! We'll order a subscription if you just mention a blurb. Damn! Tell them it's a blaster shooter action thing or whatever, I don't care. Just stop calling our office already. I was asleep. It's one PM, for crying out loud! Shit. Hang on. Okay, tell them it has desert planets and that you can do everything." It... uh... has desert planets, we guess? And you can do everything in this game. Whatever will make you money faucets preorder this thing. Three more weeks before I can finally retire from this mendacious glory hole journalism. Here's your fucking deadline, Susan, so stop punching my car. it said pick two, not four. No, no, they paid pre-development microtransactions for the extra words so it's okay. Diddle of the Carrots.

I don't blame the developers/marketers. I don't blame the developers that make those games, I see tons of people playing slot machine games on their phones so the bar is set pretty low. I do wish I could find a single decent mobile game through all the shit, though. I have pretty much given up on mobile gaming, I just emulate SNES and Game boy games because at least I know they will entertain me without trying to con me into spending fucktons of money on bullshit. One guy with money, invited me, the guy with coding skills, to make the games he couldn't find for his children (he had a 3 year old boy and a just-born girl). We made good games, no ads, no microtransactions, and so on. Reviews from specialized media, and the public, were usually above 4.5 (my guess is that our average across all games is 4.7) Yet... we didn't sold much, and while looking for our own games in the store, we finally found lots of other good ones. We found out that what is going on, is that the games that get in the "top list" or are scammy (many lists are organized by earning/time, and a good way to hit the top, is do outright scammy things, for example a popular game in my country had invisible banners, thus it racked millions in fraudulent money and shoot up to the first spot... Apple then returned all the advertisers money, and banned the guy from the store, but he was already famous after hitting the first spot, and the clones of his game became a new genre of sorts) or they belong to companies that are media, or have connections with media (example: my biggest competitors were Disney, that has connections with media, and Toca-Boca, that is owned by a multi-billion sized media company named Bonnier Group). Or they had friends on Google and Apple HQ (the HQ! I for example had a Google Brazil employee talk to us, review our game formally, recommend for the HQ to put it in the recommended front page, yet we never made it, instead lots of shitty stuff made it, that had authors that were ex Google HQ employees or friends of Google HQ employees). So... we gave up, the games are still up, and sometimes we update them, but it is not profitable the effort to make good games, at least not without deep media connections, and since we don't have those... (if you are curious: http://www.kidoteca.com) Why not start a mobile game review website dedicated to finding quality games? That's the part of the ecosystem that we're missing. There's no good "app/game review" website that's ubiquitous. I would use this. It's hard finding actual games for mobile. What a shame. I'm sorry you couldn't attain the success you deserved for being willing to stray from the pack. That kind of attitude should always be rewarded. Try Auralux, Pocket Mortys, and Evil Apples. Also you can play the entirety of Knights of the Old Republic on your phone so Fart of the Poopy is good, too. I like Diddle of the Pokemans try Pixel Dungeon What's up with that game? I download it, try it, can't get past the 3rd floor of the first level, get mad and uninstall it. Like is it just me or is that game really fucking hard? It's a roguelike game, they tend to be pretty tricky. Try using the wiki, trial and error. The genre is not for everyone. Its a rougelike so yeah its really hard. You're supposed to play it over and over again and get a bit further every time. The most important part is to never go to the next level before you have explored pretty much everything on the level you are at, because you need everything you find to survive later. Puzzle and Dragons is a top tier mobile game (just hit 1000 days) that you can progress forever in without spending a dollar. Oh, seriously? I saw all their ads and it looked like one of those shitty "match 3" clones that are everywhere think of it more as a match 3 RPG game with elements similar to pokemon and that's pretty much what puzzles and dragons is Not that it's a guarantee of quality, but it does have 2 3DS games. And, apparently, an anime. So... yeah. Is this one of those "you could theoretically go on forever for free, but practically speaking all of the high level content is time gated behind ridiculous timers unless you spend real money"? Ooh, I only need 1,000 Potato points for this final tier power, but free players only get a 33% chance at one potato per day... I wonder how much budget goes into advertising versus actual game. Enough to impress me that they make that much money for those kinds of advertising. Every game I've seen with a high budget commercial like that then stayed number 1 on the app store for quite a while [deleted] What? No no no, commercials work by subconsciously subverting your free will and tricking you into giving your money to some shadowy company. I learned that on Reddit. smoke. Are you smoking yet?? I still can't believe Arnold agreed to basically be the face of a game like Mobile Strike. Money must be tight. the former governor of California is the face of a mobile phone game. Just think about that They probably paid him $1 million and only need to turn up for 1 day of shooting. Even if you already have $100m, it would be tempting. If I had $100m I would still feel stupid if I didn't do a day's worth of work for another million There is not much I wouldn't do for 1 million :/ Can we get Sandra Bullock to endorse Diddle of Sadness? That was me when she took off her wildcats sweater in Speed One with big tits. Yet people keep playing them. I don't blame the developers/marketers.

[deleted] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU6WC4dpaHM Ah yes Call of Modern War: Warfare Duty The game where you go to your 9-5 job as a subcontractor for the military monitoring drones. This is the story of a soldier named Stanley. Stanley worked for the military in a big building where he was Soldier #427. Soldier #427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a joystick. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buildings to blow up, when to blow them up, and in what order. This is what Soldier #427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy. And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley; something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi.' Never in all his years in the military had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office. And then was shot by the enemy drone operator The flying kind or the office kind? Drone Dronefare This one sounds good as well. And all those idiots naming everything flappy, crossy or angry thinking their is going to sell because of that thinking They do sell.

And what he's called around the world https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F#International_editions Yup, also Wally here in poland! Way better name imo. Wally's the original name, I have no idea why they changed it into Waldo for Americans They also changed: Colour > Color Mum > Mom Aluminium > Aluminum Aeroplane > Airplane "Philosopher's Stone" > "Sorcerer's Stone" Fringe > Bangs Maths > Math Language is an odd thing... P.S. Nothing against Americans, or their language, just an observation of differences. Hey fucker you changed our airplanes into aeroplanes. My face when Americans call a beef Wellington ensemble with lettuce a "burger." Waldo was even in a couple of old games. The first was by Bethesda! He was in Morrowind, right? Someone should draw a scene with only Waldos, but one of them is someone else. A twist... Actually, the final scene in "The Great Waldo Search" is a group of Waldos. The only way you can find the true Waldo? You'll have to pay close attention to the hair... See here: http://i.imgur.com/UGtew0g.jpg I'd buy this.

It's my passion to be a drummer but I don't have a drum set. What's your article say about that. Hey, I bought my first drum set used from a buddy for 80 bucks, and the rest was (unknown) history. It definitely became a passion. You never know! That's inspiration man. I have $80 to spare.. check out your local pawn shops. they can be a treasure trove in terms of used instruments. He should get gold internet points. Feel free to give him some Did you draw this? Holy smokes, either way. Kudos on the excellent product! Yeah pencil, ink, then scanned and touched up a tad for contrast and then colored digitally. (I used reference pictures to sample the right colors) Holy shit you are a great artist,congrats this looks really good. as an artist i cant even imagine how much time this would take to make...also i like how you put in alot of classic characters and some that most people forget like wart for example(when i saw him i was like oh he did king k.rool awesome!...oh thats wart oops). nontheless great job EDIT: i just spotted king k.rool on the right side....you are amazing...i dont know how i missed it and thank you for not forgetting him like most people do including nintendo themselves Dude what are you doing, you uploaded an UNwater marked high res version!! Someone is going to steal this and reproduce it. It's fucking awesome, but seriously reduce the resolution The t-shirts are already printing. its too late This is impressive stuff man. How long did it take for both pencil and colouring? probably around 30 hours all said and done? I don't really time it or anything. That's it? Shit, that seems like not that much, considering how awesome it is. Not taking away from OP at all, this is amazing stuff. But assuming he has a job/other responsibilities. That's probably about two hours a day for a couple weeks. Not just sitting down for two days straight and not stopping Sell 50 copies at $20 a pop and that 30 hour "hobbie" seems like quite a nice side job. Minus cost of printing on nice paper in a large size and plus the time it takes to make the prints and ship out an order Well from what I'm seeing, it certainly resulted in some good work. I can draw a straight line... no wait a minute, I can't. This is amazing. Can I print a copy for my next road trip with the kids? I'm not gonna stop you. This version is slightly lower quality but it should work fine for that. I am working on figuring out if I can sell prints online somehow that would be using the full res versions but I don't know if/when that would be up. I really don't mind if you print your own, but I did set them up for sale if you're interested. Let me know if this works: http://www.zazzle.ca/alandercoloringpages/products Getting 'no products' on that page edit: Not sure why they aren't showing up but I think I can link to each poster individually. Colored version of gaming poster Uncolored Version of gaming poster Sci-fi vs Fantasy poster Random poster I see the uncolored and colored poster from this post, opened on mobile. I love some of your pattern decisions. Like, for example, Pac-Man's smile serves to make him part of two different elements. His upper side is the Windows corner and his lower side is the Nintendo corner. A lot of other ingenious little things. And Spirited Away is I suppose like a non-gaming Easter egg. I feel like ratchet and clank is super underrated. With that said, thank you for putting quark on this Clank is in there too, a little to the left of Qwark I love you Clank, Qwark but no Ratchet to be seen :( Colorizebot Wouldn't have any effect on the B/W version as it's only black and white. It lacks the grayscale information necessary for colorization purposes. u/pm_me_your_bw_pics Colorizebot has been banned from this sub. There is a full list here Have you made any other posters of this kind? I think more of your art would be appreciated. Truly amazing achievement. (Also, why no Klei? D: ) Two others so far: http://imgur.com/a/NOyLJ And I was going to put don't starve but I plum forgot :/ am i looking over solid snake? didn't end up getting him in this one but he's in the sci-fi fantasy one I did here http://imgur.com/a/NOyLJ :_( Snake...? SNAKE...?! SNAAAAAAAKEE!!!!! Dark wallpaper version if you're interested: 3840 x 2160 HQ Pretty impressive. What was your inspiration for this? A friend of mine does a crative night where they like to do crafts and color so we came up with the idea of me drawing coloring posters for them. This was the first one. I got them to give me ideas of stuff to add so it's less pop culture and more people I know and inside jokes. But it was well received so I decided to do more with themes. The second one was Sci-fi vs Fantasy themed, and this gaming one is the third now. IS THAT MOTHER FUCKING BIKER MICE FROM MARS. When I get home expect gold sir! ITS BEEN 3 hours and HE STILL HAS NO GOLD! xxYINKxx is a phony! A GOD DAMN FRAUD I was at work lol but a Lannister always pays his debts Wow thanks! :D Biker Mice are a forgotten American treasure. Thank you for keeping their memory alive. Wow. These are all incredible, dude... thanks for sharing. I miss creative nights. We should start them again when summer insanity is over. Also you're Internet famous now. Right on! Honestly, I find these two more incredible than the one you've just posted. Even though the logos, once colored, are incredible—the amount of detail in these two are remarkable. Dude you are an artistic god...wow. Hey i love these and was wondering if you could do a coloured version of these two, I would definitely buy them! Holy crap this is well done. ayy Professor Layton I didn't even bother looking for him because he's never in these sort of things and then bam, right in the middle of the coloured version. Made me very happy. It's such an underrated game imo. Definitely! I'm a huge fan of the series and I've gotten quite a few people into it over the years. And I'm delighted about the fact we have a new game arriving soon, even if he isn't the direct protagonist. Honest question about you artist that can draw this kind of stuff. Did you envisioned it all ahead or just go on a whim. For me even then, you still have to think what to draw next to make it look uniform. It takes a lot of planning. Get the basic idea in mind but then that's why you do everything in pencil first It's not even just grouping characters by their color. It's all of the characters in between and the way that they're oriented to align with the lines. Well done, this is incredible! its amazing. i wish it had Klonoa though :( That's exactly what I was thinking. Would've loved to have seen Parappa there too. WAHOO! Christ you even got Caithe in from GW2 No love for the Master Chief or Halo? :-( He's in the green part of the windows logo. Don't ask why cause I'm not sure haha FWIW, I don't think you spent too much time on this. I think you spent exactly the right amount of time making something awesome. This is awesome! I wonder if anybody can name every single character within this poster? I can! lol https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MB3j5hQd446YZTzDGqV16EF5isRdX3ljPOmYUTqfh6E I both detest and am envious of your dedication towards this. Knowing me, if I didn't list the character names, I'd put duplicates down. I did get lazy and do one duplicate of the slime from dragon quest haha Amazing I cant even draw a stick figure :/ That's awesome. Like seriously Solid Snake is perfect. Aaaaand it's been downloaded, scaled up and sent for printing :D Colouring pencils are on standby. I'm red-green colorblind, can someone help a brother out? I can see what I think to be a couple but am not sure. Nicely done!! Both the idea and execution are awesome! Well done this is epic. mad props I spent way too much time trying to figure out the colors before realizing a colored version was just a few scrolls away. You should cross post this to r/penmanshipporn or r/doodles Ooooh you should look into lenticular printing these onto one poster! (Those pictures where it looks one way from one angle and a different way from a different angle. Think animorphs cover) Anyone else see Waldo first? Is this like engrained in us from childhood?? Kinda super weird.. stoked to see Yooka made the cut Skullomania's in this! I can't find Phoenix Wright there... Where's he? ...he's there, isn't he? He's working hard for OP. He's about to get sued for this insane poster. What the fuck. How do you make that. pencil, ink, scanner and a lot of time haha You could sell these, if you aren't already. You made this? I can't make a sandwich People would definitely buy both the colored and black and white version. Took the advice and set up a store. Let me know if this works: http://www.zazzle.ca/alandercoloringpages/products edit: Not sure why they aren't showing up but I think I can link to each poster individually. Colored version of gaming poster Uncolored Version of gaming poster Sci-fi vs Fantasy poster Random poster What the fuck man? Are you an escher reincarnation or something? That's pretty cool. That's amazing. [deleted] Found Jebediah Kerman [deleted] Fisto 4 lyfe You mean you spent a great amount of time making something awesome and it turned out great. Amazing! Thank you for this post. You've given me so many new ideas for art projects/presents for people. Very cool. Gotta challenge for you all: In the uncolored version, find waldo! BC represent! Really cool designs. Hopefully you make some more! Props for Yooka Laylee. Color me impressed. That makes my brain freak out. Holy cow. How long did that take?! I was just thinking, this would be amazing with some color... Scrolled to the next image and then bam! Awesome job dude. As a color blind guy: fuck you, but also thank you for including the colored picture! I want you to know that I appreciate your inclusion of rob the robot. Found Harambe bottom right, god bless Sell this on Etsy ;) consistency You're that guy that circles Waldo... There is one of those guys on deviantart [deleted] I would also like to know...for science I don't think you understand science. May he does ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) But it's August! I think they are saying that the experience of finding Waldo prompts them to choke the chicken. I trust this guy's assessment Who ruins the fun for everyone.... Just like the people who write in my monthly Highlights magazine! Is that still around? That was top shelf at the elementary library. Good luck snagging it first during reading time. I remember signing up for Highlights at a book fair just so i could keep up with those two boys.. Terrance and Truent? ........ Goofus and Gallant you motherfucker! When your parents name you "Goofus" you are doomed from birth. And saved me 20 mins Check it again against your list n’ see consistency. He ain't never gonna be president now Have not heard Miranda's rapping since I saw In the Heights like 7 years ago. You mean you've not listened to Hamilton yet? hooooooooooo boy you are in for a treat Um... Please go listen to Hamilton. /r/UnexpectedHamilton I never spent a cent that wasn't mine. God dammit where are the other two in other posters they made before that were mentioned in another comment Ahh, thanks :D You actually looked through the non coloured one? I had such an amazing nostalgia trip looking at this, thank you OP truly I enjoyed looking at this. Im gonna make it my desktop. You're awesome Glad to see super meat boy in there. Very nice work It's so nice to see Strong Bad amongst these more popular faces :) Everyone asks where Waldo is but nobody asks how Waldo is. So sad :'( that empty smile pretty nice? thats a freaking masterpiece. a freaking masterpiece? thats a work of art. A work of art? That's pretty nice. He's called Wally in the UK. And what he's called around the world https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F#International_editions Yup, also Wally here in poland! Way better name imo. Wally's the original name, I have no idea why they changed it into Waldo for Americans They also changed: Colour > Color Mum > Mom Aluminium > Aluminum Aeroplane > Airplane "Philosopher's Stone" > "Sorcerer's Stone" Fringe > Bangs Maths > Math Language is an odd thing... P.S. Nothing against Americans, or their language, just an observation of differences. Hey fucker you changed our airplanes into aeroplanes. My face when Americans call a beef Wellington ensemble with lettuce a "burger." Waldo was even in a couple of old games. The first was by Bethesda! He was in Morrowind, right? Someone should draw a scene with only Waldos, but one of them is someone else. A twist... Actually, the final scene in "The Great Waldo Search" is a group of Waldos. The only way you can find the true Waldo? You'll have to pay close attention to the hair... See here: http://i.imgur.com/UGtew0g.jpg consistency You're that guy that circles Waldo...

(I used reference pictures to sample the right colors) Holy shit you are a great artist,congrats this looks really good. as an artist i cant even imagine how much time this would take to make...also i like how you put in alot of classic characters and some that most people forget like wart for example(when i saw him i was like oh he did king k.rool awesome!...oh thats wart oops). nontheless great job EDIT: i just spotted king k.rool on the right side....you are amazing...i dont know how i missed it and thank you for not forgetting him like most people do including nintendo themselves Holy shit you are a great artist,congrats this looks really good. as an artist i cant even imagine how much time this would take to make...also i like how you put in alot of classic characters and some that most people forget like wart for example(when i saw him i was like oh he did king k.rool awesome!...oh thats wart oops). nontheless great job EDIT: i just spotted king k.rool on the right side....you are amazing...i dont know how i missed it and thank you for not forgetting him like most people do including nintendo themselves The t-shirts are already printing. its too late probably around 30 hours all said and done? I don't really time it or anything. That's it? Shit, that seems like not that much, considering how awesome it is. Not taking away from OP at all, this is amazing stuff. But assuming he has a job/other responsibilities. That's probably about two hours a day for a couple weeks. Not just sitting down for two days straight and not stopping Sell 50 copies at $20 a pop and that 30 hour "hobbie" seems like quite a nice side job.

Not just sitting down for two days straight and not stopping Sell 50 copies at $20 a pop and that 30 hour "hobbie" seems like quite a nice side job. Minus cost of printing on nice paper in a large size and plus the time it takes to make the prints and ship out an order Well from what I'm seeing, it certainly resulted in some good work.

This version is slightly lower quality but it should work fine for that. I am working on figuring out if I can sell prints online somehow that would be using the full res versions but I don't know if/when that would be up. I really don't mind if you print your own, but I did set them up for sale if you're interested.

SNAKE...?! SNAAAAAAAKEE!!!!! :_( A friend of mine does a crative night where they like to do crafts and color so we came up with the idea of me drawing coloring posters for them. This was the first one. I got them to give me ideas of stuff to add so it's less pop culture and more people I know and inside jokes. But it was well received so I decided to do more with themes. The second one was Sci-fi vs Fantasy themed, and this gaming one is the third now. IS THAT MOTHER FUCKING BIKER MICE FROM MARS. When I get home expect gold sir!

I didn't even bother looking for him because he's never in these sort of things and then bam, right in the middle of the coloured version. Made me very happy. It's such an underrated game imo. Definitely! I'm a huge fan of the series and I've gotten quite a few people into it over the years. And I'm delighted about the fact we have a new game arriving soon, even if he isn't the direct protagonist. It's such an underrated game imo. Definitely!

Colored version of gaming poster Uncolored Version of gaming poster Sci-fi vs Fantasy poster Random poster Fisto 4 lyfe It would actually be really dope if a game used clay graphics, kinda like how cuphead uses it's old school animations. Edit: thanks for all the recommendations guys :) The Neverhood aka one of the greatest puzzle adventure comedies of all time. I remember getting stuck on that game and never being able to finish it. I was too young to know I could just look up the damn answer. Looking that up back in 97 wasn't that easy. I got stuck as well and ended up calling people who had finished it to fish for answers. "Calling" people? I don't understand... You would use the landline in your parents' house to call other landlines where your friends' parents would pick up. You would then proceed to ask if your friend could come to the phone so you could fish for answers. Alternatively you'd take the bus into town, pick up some games magazine and pray to Jesus that it contained a walkthrough or some cheat codes. I got kicked out of the local Blockbuster because I would go in and copy cheat codes from the code books. There I was, flying down on my stomach, pencil in hand, transcribing the entire book by hand like a Franciscan monk. I'm imagining a young person laying down on a skateboard "flying" around the blockbuster while copying down cheat codes. That's exactly how the 90's were. Everyone just belly flying on skateboards. Only 90's kids remeber When they weren't slamming pogs on their friends punk asses you mean... Blockbuster had cheat codes? I remember the game consoles, but actual cheat books seem out of place. Yeah, have you never seen a comprehensive cheat book? They used to be everywhere even up to the early 2000's. They had nearly every mainstream game in them separated out by console with all the cheat codes. Still have an old game Genie book for the NES. Pages and pages of arcane incantations (aka strings of hex) to make everything easier. Are you sure you weren't kicked out for flying inside the store? Other customers kinda don't appreciate kids whizzing around the place. Every christmas on my list was for a year subscription to NINTENDO POWER for that reason! The fuck is a landline? Basically two cans connected by a piece of string. Connected by a series of tubes. Tangled up tubes. It puts the lotion on its skin.... A cellphone without a battery, so it has to be plugged in 24/7. Finally! I don't have to lug this cell phone around. Next thing you're gonna tell me is that there is some kind of booth with the landline inside in public areas. Oh, Hermes... Sounds awful Should we tell him about how rotary phones worked? it gets worse. you couldn't plug it in the mains socket, it had special wires with special electricity in them. Yep, in the South if your friend was a Jr. You'd ask for 'Little <insert name here>" Is John there? Big or Little? Little. Little john? Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah! WHHHHAAAT? I'm so glad that the elder millennials showed up to this thread to comment. The struggle was real. I'm old enough to remember what the world was like before being able to just Google an answer. But young enough to have been shown how to use the new technologies as they developed. I was about to rant like this so hard. Doesn't it feel like we were shown how hard life was and then they just internet-ed our life into the new century? -Born 1990 kid I'm glad I got through high school without social media being a thing. I can only imagine the idiotic "deep" shit my 15 year old self would have written. I hope my high school Myspace blogs are buried so deep in the net that they can never be found again. I have so much idiotic shit to atone for that randomly crops up on my time hop. Count your blessings. Yeah, I get why your saying. I think us older millennials appreciate the technology more because we remember life without it. Some of these younger kids now just take it for granted. "Meh, kids these days! They take everything for granted!" -us Damn son, I guess we old as fuck now. Dude, yes. I couldn't agree more. I'll never forget getting on AOL for the first time lol (1993) this is the part of my childhood i really do not miss. I remember when GTA Vice City came out. I made a promise to myself never to use a cheat code ever again. After I beat it, I knew I could do anything. Then GTA: SA came out and that goddamn dirtbike could never keep up with that train no matter what i did. I don't play video games anymore, but I did beat 4 and 5 on my own just to maintain some sort of balance inside my head that I don't need no Gamepro magazine to help me through life. Yeah. I remember running out to my dad as he came home from work yelling and bragging that I had beaten Quake 1 before him. I had used /impulse9 (all weapons) and /noclip (run through walls). He was not impressed. You'd have to wait until someone was off the dialup internet first. You could even call a tip hotline. The number was usually printed on the manual of the game somewhere. For under $1.00/minute, you could call the hotline and they would help you solve the more difficult puzzles. Being a gamer in the 90's was hard work. I miss it, though. Before you could Google (or rather, AskJeeves or Yahoo or Lycos) how to beat a game, you had to figure it out. And it was super-satisfying to know you'd figured it out yourself. Many games were hard too, you get get stuck for hours or days. It's a shame now that any bit you can't beat in a game is solved by a quick search. Now everything has a waypoint system as well, making finding important locations trivial. I remember a quest back in vanilla WoW that gave info on landmarks you had to follow to find a NPC somewhere in the woods. Now it just puts a marker on the map. You'd lift the receiver off the hook, give the magneto generator a few cranks, then, speaking clearly into the transmitter, politely introduce yourself to Marjorie the operator and ask to be connected to Geoffrey person-to-person. It's not hard. Automated switching happened because the guy who invented it ran a funeral parlor and the operator kept connecting people to his competitor because operator was competetor's relative. That's great ingenuity. A lot of people would just sue. Not invent. Oh, man... This brings back memories of adventure games back in the 1980's. Zork, Ultima, that sort of thing. If you got stuck, you had to rely on hint books that game developers published. Two stories here: (1) InvisiClues - a series of hint books that used invisible ink to hide the answers. You used a special marker to reveal them, but only for questions that you really needed answered. The authors would load up the books with red-herring questions and nonsensical answers to deter cheating. Lots of fun. (2) A gaming hint book compendium - basically, people bundled up hints for solving lots of games, and sold them together. My family had a computer and some games, but not much disposable income - not enough to blow on those kinds of books. So whenever I ran into an unsolvable puzzle, I'd wait for the next trip to the mall, then visit the bookstore and get the hint I needed from the hint book on the shelf. My old man played that game and as I was only around five or six I'd sit in a dining room chair at his side and watch him navigate through it, solving the puzzles like a champ and laughing at the hilarious plot/cinematics. The point of me telling you this is b/c I can remember he was stuck on a puzzle for days, maybe weeks. Just plain stumped. Had to arrange colored lights in a certain way to solve the thing but there was no clear indication of the order they should go in and the combinations were too many to solve through process of elimination. Written above the puzzle was this: B.O.B.B.Y. So I says, "Blue Orange Blue Blue Yellow" and the old man looks at me, smiling a smile that says no son, it can't be that easy... It was the combination of course and the puzzle was solved and we could finally move on. Now I'm 26 and we still every once and a while come back to that game and that moment--still laugh and say, "BOBBY -- BLue Orange Blue Blue Yellow! Klog go all stinky bad! OMFG I you just brought back so many memories. I loved this game as a kid and couldn't remember what it was called! member Clayfighter? Oh yeah I member. Loved that game. The Snowman is the character that sticks out in my memory. Here's something for the nostalgia trip. Neverhood's Soundtrack Thank so much for this bro, I just got crazy chills listening to that. The crazy thing is I remember each track and know where a few of them play specifically in the map haha. Fuck they need to rerelease The Neverhood. I just found a spiritual successor to The Neverhood, it's called Armikrog and it's on Steam and this console gen, too It's terrible and buggy, huge disappointment. That's too bad, because I was hoping for better, also I really like Rob Paulson. Super nice guy. I was too. Read the steam reviews for the game, they are pretty accurate. http://store.steampowered.com/app/334120/ Holy crap thanks for this! This game horrified me as a child. I don't know where I'd be without Neverhood and Myst / Riven. Those games teach more thinking skills to kids than all the years of school put together. Interestingly enough the models in the original Dooms were made out of clay. Here's a photo of Adrian Carmack sculpting one, which would then be photographed, rescaled, recoloured and then animated for the game. Here's a real life spider mastermind. That is pretty interesting If you want to know more: John Carmack created a program called "Fuzzy Pumper Pallete Shop" which the artists used to manipulate video of the models. From the DoomWik: "This program was initially used by Adrian Carmack to capture the eight needed rotation frames of his hand-sculpted clay models. The model would be placed inside a brightly lit white box on a rotating modeling stand and then captured through video into the program. The resulting images were "distorted,"[1] and in substantial need of touch-ups. When the clay modeling process proved too slow to be practical, the program still proved itself useful for capturing images of the metal-and-latex miniatures created by Gregor Punchatz. Other items captured included shots of Kevin Cloud wielding various plastic toy guns which became the basis of Doom's weapons, Tom Hall's girlfriend's Eager Beaver chainsaw, a pair of snake skin boots, and a bloody scab on Kevin's knee - the latter two became parts of various wall textures." If you are interested in the making of Doom and the history of id software I can't recommend the book Masters of Doom enough. I never realized those spider masterminds had hands. It must suck to have an itch I did not know this, wow! That mane tho Thanks for sharing this, pretty cool! This is often done in animation, but more as a reference model than an actual product that gets photographed. Kirby and the rainbow curse! So, Kiby's made of clay, Yoshi's made of yarn, Mario's made of paper... has someone at Nintendo accidentally locked themselves in an arts and crafts store and this is their way of asking for help? We need a tin toy zelda game Actually, Yoshi has a game where he is made of wool (Yoshi's Wooly World), and Kirby had the game where he was yarn (Kirby's Epic Yarn). Platypus ClayFighter When I first got my N64 the only two games I had for so long were Mario 64 and Clayfighter. I put so many hours into Clay Fighter do you still have the 64 version? worth a penny now I believe Just checked it on Amazon. Pretty cheap if you don't care about the box or the special edition. Special edition is $3000 with the box. I'm not sure if I should pick up the SNES or the 64 version though. The sculptors cut was exclusive to blockbuster. I have the Sculptor's Cut version. Don't have the box, unfortunately. I had no idea what it was worth until recently! Clay fighter was the fucking tits Let's get ready to cruuumble! God I miss that game First thing I thought of....Bad Mr. Frosty 4 lyfe Git em kitty! Clayfighter was awesome! Hell yes. I remember my uncle getting me that for my birthday and how pissed my mother was. Good times. Wow! Thanks for Platypus I totally forgot about this game and I played it alot long time ago! Never had clayfighters but I had biofreaks. I remember it being awesome. It's not:( Skull monkeys The Swapper uses clay and it's pretty amazing! Whaaaaaat, I had no idea that was the case! I haven't finished the game but came atleast halfway before real life interrupted me! The Neverhood, great claymation game. There are! Clay Fighter (1, 2, 63 1/3), Clay Jam... and I can't remember the rest. Lol There was an iOS game from way back when that used clay graphics, it was about a ball rolling down a hill if I remember correctly. Clay Jam! It was actually pretty good for a mobile game It's incredible, and you can still download it today, at least on Android. BombSquad! Came here to say this! For those who don't know, it's really cool because people can join the game with a smartphone as their controller. I believe you can even play 2 players using just one keyboard, or you can also add players using their phone as a controller (if they get the app which is pretty small I think). So it's kind of a cool idea; you can use a laptop and get a sweet party game going wherever. I've used it a couple times with my team on road trips. A lot of claymation games I know of have already been mentioned, but I'd also recommend the crazy, out-of-this-world RPG Hylics. That game is one of the trippiest I've ever seen. Gang beasts is kind of clay-like. And hilarious. The things I'd do for a new ClayFighter... Bringing back memories of playing Claymations on the SNES! You mean Claymates? I'd play it. Take my money! I'd definitely contribute to a crowdsourcing campaign. As long as I can just hit a button to donate and that's the end of it. Even if a full game doesn't get made it would be worth it as long as he releases tonnes of new animations. I've been burned a few times getting too personally involved in online creative investments and find the best way is to just donate a hundred bucks and forget about it for a year and hope you're pleasantly surprised. Otherwise you find yourself refreshing updates 10 times a day and getting way too stressed out and it just takes over your life. Its a bit like when you decide to buy bitcoins locally instead of through an exchange. You message a few people trying to get the best rate and you've finally got 3 who offer you a 5 percent markup. One guy offers a case of homemade port wine as part of the deal and that seals it. You meet of at his gorgeous country estate, give him your address 17q4HGtQSjuthrqWMsPzshyoNKkpmKRyrK and it clears in 10 minutes and you toast each other with a shot of port. The next thing you know you awake in a beautifully furnished but unfamiliar room. You get up and look for the door but find their isn't one. Just then your twin sister groggily comes too and as you lock eyes you hear a voice come over the intercom telling you not to worry. He's going to let you leave but you must pass a simple test, from a standing position you must ejaculate with enough force to touch the ceiling. You nervously laugh and tell him this is funny and all but just let us leave. Suddenly a computerized female voice intones "26" and you hear a moaning of gears and in an instant the walls contract 3 inches on both sides. Hahaha this isn't funny....silence. 3 hours later the voice intones "25" and the room contracts again. Jesus christ, realizing this lunatic is for real you tell your sister to hide her head under her pillow as you open up your laptop and search for "maria ozawa english interview" on youtube. You watch her done up in a classy dress talking about how shes having so much fun doing tv in indonesia and loves her fans, plus some random broll of her on set in between takes laughing with the camera man, you get a crush on her and almost forget the extreme porn she did before going to asiamoviepass and watching the high def preview of her "dream girlfriends" 30 guy bukkake scene and start furiously jacking off as if your life literally depended on it. You time your ejaculation to the exact height of arousal and see your sister hopefully poke a hopeful eye out of her pillow to spy on your ejaculations trajectory. At first there's hope but it stalls 2 feet short before glumly raining down on the marble floor. Over the next 3 days you try every combination of pornography and dark erotic fantasy you can conjure, you even try jumping off the bed as you ejaculate before a voice screams NO!!!! And the female voice intones 17 11 as the room contracts almost 2 feet. Food has been dropped through a hole in the ceiling this time and has enabled you to recover enough to continue ejaculating but by now your room has shrunken from a spacious hotel room to a room young Harry Potter would have found cramped. as the voice now intones "3" Your sister has long since stopped hiding her head and has instead been watching your beat off with intense hope, though you tried to hide it, you've become involuntarily aroused by her attention and even came within 7 inches of the ceiling once. But 7 inches seems like 7 miles and you've now switched from porn to tentacle hentai in a last ditch effort. You're staring intently at the protaganist being penetraded every possible way in the second episode of Angel Blade before a hand reaches out and shuts the laptop screen as another hand grabs your penis. You gasp and nearly ejaculate right there as tears fill your eyes and you shake your head "sis no, no!" It's ok, I'm your sister. I'm your sister, I AM YOUR SISTER. Tears fill her eyes too as she kneels and places your balls in her mouth and she removes her shirt and places your hand on her breast as her eyes beckon towards the ceiling. Your horror gives way to pure pleasure and you feel an intense wave relief "we're going to live".... When you try to tell people to be wary about crowdfunding and then break out into a bitcoin-buying-gone-wrong-now-it's-about-incest story. I laughed, I cried, I came. BITCOIN GONE WRONG. GONE SEXUAL. u/hobdobbly has the best comment history I skipped to the last paragraph when I saw how long this was. Definitely missed something important. You sure did. I had to read it twice through and am still not sure where it went so wrong What? My boner is confused beat it bro Hey you, quit yappin' and keep fappin'! Cum on the ceiling too /r/wincest I hate when that happens Man, don't you hate when you're tryna get some bitcoins and then your sister starts jerkin your gerkin? Dude what the fuck Yeah, it's a bit like that I agree This...things like this is why reddit is amazing I don't know about you, but I just hit the ceiling. I'm pretty sure this qualifies for /r/bestof but I'm not certain.... How it went from donations to incest is beyond me What did i just read. Either a copy-pasta, or the birth of a copy-pasta. I'd definitely contribute to a crowdsourcing campaign. As long as I can just hit a button to donate and that's the end of it.

Otherwise you find yourself refreshing updates 10 times a day and getting way too stressed out and it just takes over your life. Everyone is talking about the weirdness of everything after this bit, but this is absolutely excellent advice for backing Kickstarters. If you find a KS that looks good and think the devs can deliver (be sure to research first!), donate and then just forget about it. You'll either be pleasantly surprised when it finishes or disappointed when it doesn't, but at least you won't be stressed. Yeah, that's..... That's good advice. It's the rest of it that's the worrying part. r/jesuschristreddit Hey man, that's what its like being at the frontline of economic development in an ever more globalized society This is the greatest thing I'll read today. How about all week? I also just read the Anne Frank Prego Porn parody...that was better...but GOD DAMN reddit internet in general, what is wrong with you? Return of Bozarking! Dude what the fuck? That was awesome I looked the about the first two sentences and then skipped to the bottom. I am never going to read the rest so i shall forever be confused. And wonder how it got there. Come on... did you write this yourself or is this just some pasta ?? If not pasta, someone fucking give him his gold already I aspire to write biblical prophecies such as this. My username is relevant! He clearly said episode 2 not one. Calling on /u/Angelblade2 Edit: omg there's actually an account with that name This was fucking amazing. However, I'm not sure what's more frightening.. The fact that this is your imagination or the fact that you actually took the time to write it out. Either way, I am in awe. ok. what just happened? The fuck? Wow. Saved. To people in this thread, this guy's post history is a goldmine/shitshow, depending on your sense of humor. Problem is, it would take hours and hundred of dollars to render each frame. Sounds like a job for Amazon's Mechanical Turk. [deleted] Hah, of course it's by Lee Hardcastle. The guy is awesome. Yeah, I guessed as much as soon as I saw it. If it's claymation and it's disgustingly violent, it's gotta be Lee Hardcastle. I have no idea how that guy cranks this stuff out, either. He's a beast. Have you seen his video for NIGHTMARE? His stuff can get a bit cartoonish at times (intentionally so, I guess), but this one's just excellent. Whoah. That was something else. Check out this one. Always been my favorite. Although all the videos he's done is worth checking out. https://youtu.be/y_z3EBalwI4 mew mew... MEW MEW! Thank you Lee Hardcastle is great. He's done some hilarious and gruesome claymations over the years. All amazing. Just a couple of my favourites The Raid The Thing He originally made "Pingu's The Thing" but the copyright holders for Pingu made him take it down. He also made Frozen The Thing which has been around reddit before. He does good work. But godddamn, if that Simpsons one didn't leave me sick to my stomach. Simpsons couch gag Warning: you think it sounds silly and everyone are just overreacting for the karma. But they're not. Im not going to lie. When i saw that, i felt some of my humanity leave. Am I just dead inside, or was that not as bad as everyone seems to think it is Did nothing for me. Couldn't even get hard. 0/10. Well why the hell did I watch that?! My damned curiosity got the better of me and I regret it. That was awful! I'm assuming it's NSFW It's soft emotional music played over legitimately disturbing gore. So, yes. A simpsons snuff film. Ah fuck. I can't believe you've done this. Classic Chief Wiggum! There is no unseeing that I knew this reminded me of that for a reason. Not much horror stuff really rattles me, but that fucked me up for the night. I've never seen The Thing (saw the prequel though) but I vividly remember the first time watching Claycat's version and being deeply disturbed by the scene where three of them are tied up and one is revealed to be the thing. Holy shit, that would be insane to be tied up to someone and find out that they're a monster! The movie is really good, and horrifying. The mutation effects are extremely well done, along with great scene writing like the one you described. Do yourself a favor and give it a watch sometime, if you can stomach the psychological gore horror. You should see The Thing. It is fantastic; way better than the prequel Yeah I heard, and I'm always down to watch whatever Kurt Russell is starring in. I guess I'll just wait until it's on Netflix again. You should watch the original then. That's the best scene. Oh yea! He's the guy who made one of my favourite music videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0WLFpIQ0o0 edit: this one started playing while I was posting. It's actually fucking awesome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71xpQUFgk_k Not to mention this wicked music video for Gunship - Tech Noir. Now I have to go watch The Raid again. I recommend that movie to everyone and they look at me like I'm retarded or soemthing. They have no taste I guess. Claymation takes some serious time and dedication. Kudos to doing this, it's great Holy seizure juice batman! Under Doom Guy's mask reveals....Wallace. Rip and tear, Gromit! Epilepsy warning!! I knead this game Doughn't tempt me, OP Reminds me of Klay World Now that's a name I haven't heard in years HEY DAVEEEE YOU GONNA EAT THAT SALAD? Source for the gif: https://youtu.be/f8aU4MYDsOQ GEDDUM LITTLE BUDDY Why, Why can I hear the music!? I don't know what it is, but claymations always creeped me out. All the creatures of hell look so adorable in clay form, I kinda feel bad for them This is the tragedy of war. Is this lee hard castle's work? I love the way the shotgun bends when he reloads it. I just want to know why he wasted a chainsaw charge on a possessed scientist A friend of mine does some pretty awesome/brutal claymation. If you like this than check out Mr. Oz' stuff I found the full version. It's by Lee Hardcastle. The Neverhood aka one of the greatest puzzle adventure comedies of all time. I remember getting stuck on that game and never being able to finish it. I was too young to know I could just look up the damn answer. Looking that up back in 97 wasn't that easy. I got stuck as well and ended up calling people who had finished it to fish for answers. "Calling" people? I don't understand... You would use the landline in your parents' house to call other landlines where your friends' parents would pick up. You would then proceed to ask if your friend could come to the phone so you could fish for answers. Alternatively you'd take the bus into town, pick up some games magazine and pray to Jesus that it contained a walkthrough or some cheat codes. I got kicked out of the local Blockbuster because I would go in and copy cheat codes from the code books. There I was, flying down on my stomach, pencil in hand, transcribing the entire book by hand like a Franciscan monk. I'm imagining a young person laying down on a skateboard "flying" around the blockbuster while copying down cheat codes. That's exactly how the 90's were. Everyone just belly flying on skateboards. Only 90's kids remeber When they weren't slamming pogs on their friends punk asses you mean... Blockbuster had cheat codes? I remember the game consoles, but actual cheat books seem out of place. Yeah, have you never seen a comprehensive cheat book? They used to be everywhere even up to the early 2000's. They had nearly every mainstream game in them separated out by console with all the cheat codes. Still have an old game Genie book for the NES. Pages and pages of arcane incantations (aka strings of hex) to make everything easier. Are you sure you weren't kicked out for flying inside the store? Other customers kinda don't appreciate kids whizzing around the place. Every christmas on my list was for a year subscription to NINTENDO POWER for that reason! The fuck is a landline? Basically two cans connected by a piece of string. Connected by a series of tubes. Tangled up tubes. It puts the lotion on its skin.... A cellphone without a battery, so it has to be plugged in 24/7. Finally! I don't have to lug this cell phone around. Next thing you're gonna tell me is that there is some kind of booth with the landline inside in public areas. Oh, Hermes... Sounds awful Should we tell him about how rotary phones worked? it gets worse. you couldn't plug it in the mains socket, it had special wires with special electricity in them. Yep, in the South if your friend was a Jr. You'd ask for 'Little <insert name here>" Is John there? Big or Little? Little. Little john? Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah! WHHHHAAAT? I'm so glad that the elder millennials showed up to this thread to comment. The struggle was real. I'm old enough to remember what the world was like before being able to just Google an answer. But young enough to have been shown how to use the new technologies as they developed. I was about to rant like this so hard. Doesn't it feel like we were shown how hard life was and then they just internet-ed our life into the new century? -Born 1990 kid I'm glad I got through high school without social media being a thing. I can only imagine the idiotic "deep" shit my 15 year old self would have written. I hope my high school Myspace blogs are buried so deep in the net that they can never be found again. I have so much idiotic shit to atone for that randomly crops up on my time hop. Count your blessings. Yeah, I get why your saying. I think us older millennials appreciate the technology more because we remember life without it. Some of these younger kids now just take it for granted. "Meh, kids these days! They take everything for granted!" -us Damn son, I guess we old as fuck now. Dude, yes. I couldn't agree more. I'll never forget getting on AOL for the first time lol (1993) this is the part of my childhood i really do not miss. I remember when GTA Vice City came out. I made a promise to myself never to use a cheat code ever again. After I beat it, I knew I could do anything. Then GTA: SA came out and that goddamn dirtbike could never keep up with that train no matter what i did. I don't play video games anymore, but I did beat 4 and 5 on my own just to maintain some sort of balance inside my head that I don't need no Gamepro magazine to help me through life. Yeah. I remember running out to my dad as he came home from work yelling and bragging that I had beaten Quake 1 before him. I had used /impulse9 (all weapons) and /noclip (run through walls). He was not impressed. You'd have to wait until someone was off the dialup internet first. You could even call a tip hotline. The number was usually printed on the manual of the game somewhere. For under $1.00/minute, you could call the hotline and they would help you solve the more difficult puzzles. Being a gamer in the 90's was hard work. I miss it, though. Before you could Google (or rather, AskJeeves or Yahoo or Lycos) how to beat a game, you had to figure it out. And it was super-satisfying to know you'd figured it out yourself. Many games were hard too, you get get stuck for hours or days. It's a shame now that any bit you can't beat in a game is solved by a quick search. Now everything has a waypoint system as well, making finding important locations trivial. I remember a quest back in vanilla WoW that gave info on landmarks you had to follow to find a NPC somewhere in the woods. Now it just puts a marker on the map. You'd lift the receiver off the hook, give the magneto generator a few cranks, then, speaking clearly into the transmitter, politely introduce yourself to Marjorie the operator and ask to be connected to Geoffrey person-to-person. It's not hard. Automated switching happened because the guy who invented it ran a funeral parlor and the operator kept connecting people to his competitor because operator was competetor's relative. That's great ingenuity. A lot of people would just sue. Not invent. Oh, man... This brings back memories of adventure games back in the 1980's. Zork, Ultima, that sort of thing. If you got stuck, you had to rely on hint books that game developers published. Two stories here: (1) InvisiClues - a series of hint books that used invisible ink to hide the answers. You used a special marker to reveal them, but only for questions that you really needed answered. The authors would load up the books with red-herring questions and nonsensical answers to deter cheating. Lots of fun. (2) A gaming hint book compendium - basically, people bundled up hints for solving lots of games, and sold them together. My family had a computer and some games, but not much disposable income - not enough to blow on those kinds of books. So whenever I ran into an unsolvable puzzle, I'd wait for the next trip to the mall, then visit the bookstore and get the hint I needed from the hint book on the shelf. My old man played that game and as I was only around five or six I'd sit in a dining room chair at his side and watch him navigate through it, solving the puzzles like a champ and laughing at the hilarious plot/cinematics. The point of me telling you this is b/c I can remember he was stuck on a puzzle for days, maybe weeks. Just plain stumped. Had to arrange colored lights in a certain way to solve the thing but there was no clear indication of the order they should go in and the combinations were too many to solve through process of elimination. Written above the puzzle was this: B.O.B.B.Y. So I says, "Blue Orange Blue Blue Yellow" and the old man looks at me, smiling a smile that says no son, it can't be that easy... It was the combination of course and the puzzle was solved and we could finally move on. Now I'm 26 and we still every once and a while come back to that game and that moment--still laugh and say, "BOBBY -- BLue Orange Blue Blue Yellow! Klog go all stinky bad! OMFG I you just brought back so many memories. I loved this game as a kid and couldn't remember what it was called! member Clayfighter? Oh yeah I member. Loved that game. The Snowman is the character that sticks out in my memory. Here's something for the nostalgia trip. Neverhood's Soundtrack Thank so much for this bro, I just got crazy chills listening to that. The crazy thing is I remember each track and know where a few of them play specifically in the map haha. Fuck they need to rerelease The Neverhood. I just found a spiritual successor to The Neverhood, it's called Armikrog and it's on Steam and this console gen, too It's terrible and buggy, huge disappointment. That's too bad, because I was hoping for better, also I really like Rob Paulson. Super nice guy. I was too. Read the steam reviews for the game, they are pretty accurate. http://store.steampowered.com/app/334120/ Holy crap thanks for this! This game horrified me as a child. I don't know where I'd be without Neverhood and Myst / Riven. Those games teach more thinking skills to kids than all the years of school put together. Interestingly enough the models in the original Dooms were made out of clay. Here's a photo of Adrian Carmack sculpting one, which would then be photographed, rescaled, recoloured and then animated for the game. Here's a real life spider mastermind. That is pretty interesting If you want to know more: John Carmack created a program called "Fuzzy Pumper Pallete Shop" which the artists used to manipulate video of the models. From the DoomWik: "This program was initially used by Adrian Carmack to capture the eight needed rotation frames of his hand-sculpted clay models. The model would be placed inside a brightly lit white box on a rotating modeling stand and then captured through video into the program. The resulting images were "distorted,"[1] and in substantial need of touch-ups. When the clay modeling process proved too slow to be practical, the program still proved itself useful for capturing images of the metal-and-latex miniatures created by Gregor Punchatz. Other items captured included shots of Kevin Cloud wielding various plastic toy guns which became the basis of Doom's weapons, Tom Hall's girlfriend's Eager Beaver chainsaw, a pair of snake skin boots, and a bloody scab on Kevin's knee - the latter two became parts of various wall textures." If you are interested in the making of Doom and the history of id software I can't recommend the book Masters of Doom enough. I never realized those spider masterminds had hands. It must suck to have an itch I did not know this, wow! That mane tho Thanks for sharing this, pretty cool! This is often done in animation, but more as a reference model than an actual product that gets photographed. Kirby and the rainbow curse! So, Kiby's made of clay, Yoshi's made of yarn, Mario's made of paper... has someone at Nintendo accidentally locked themselves in an arts and crafts store and this is their way of asking for help? We need a tin toy zelda game Actually, Yoshi has a game where he is made of wool (Yoshi's Wooly World), and Kirby had the game where he was yarn (Kirby's Epic Yarn). Platypus ClayFighter When I first got my N64 the only two games I had for so long were Mario 64 and Clayfighter. I put so many hours into Clay Fighter do you still have the 64 version? worth a penny now I believe Just checked it on Amazon. Pretty cheap if you don't care about the box or the special edition. Special edition is $3000 with the box. I'm not sure if I should pick up the SNES or the 64 version though. The sculptors cut was exclusive to blockbuster. I have the Sculptor's Cut version. Don't have the box, unfortunately. I had no idea what it was worth until recently! Clay fighter was the fucking tits Let's get ready to cruuumble! God I miss that game First thing I thought of....Bad Mr. Frosty 4 lyfe Git em kitty! Clayfighter was awesome! Hell yes. I remember my uncle getting me that for my birthday and how pissed my mother was. Good times. Wow! Thanks for Platypus I totally forgot about this game and I played it alot long time ago! Never had clayfighters but I had biofreaks. I remember it being awesome. It's not:( Skull monkeys The Swapper uses clay and it's pretty amazing! Whaaaaaat, I had no idea that was the case! I haven't finished the game but came atleast halfway before real life interrupted me! The Neverhood, great claymation game. There are! Clay Fighter (1, 2, 63 1/3), Clay Jam... and I can't remember the rest. Lol There was an iOS game from way back when that used clay graphics, it was about a ball rolling down a hill if I remember correctly. Clay Jam! It was actually pretty good for a mobile game It's incredible, and you can still download it today, at least on Android. BombSquad! Came here to say this! For those who don't know, it's really cool because people can join the game with a smartphone as their controller. I believe you can even play 2 players using just one keyboard, or you can also add players using their phone as a controller (if they get the app which is pretty small I think). So it's kind of a cool idea; you can use a laptop and get a sweet party game going wherever. I've used it a couple times with my team on road trips. A lot of claymation games I know of have already been mentioned, but I'd also recommend the crazy, out-of-this-world RPG Hylics. That game is one of the trippiest I've ever seen. Gang beasts is kind of clay-like. And hilarious. The things I'd do for a new ClayFighter... Bringing back memories of playing Claymations on the SNES! You mean Claymates? I remember getting stuck on that game and never being able to finish it. I was too young to know I could just look up the damn answer. Looking that up back in 97 wasn't that easy.

I'm so glad that the elder millennials showed up to this thread to comment. The struggle was real. I'm old enough to remember what the world was like before being able to just Google an answer. But young enough to have been shown how to use the new technologies as they developed. I was about to rant like this so hard. Doesn't it feel like we were shown how hard life was and then they just internet-ed our life into the new century? -Born 1990 kid I'm glad I got through high school without social media being a thing. I can only imagine the idiotic "deep" shit my 15 year old self would have written. I hope my high school Myspace blogs are buried so deep in the net that they can never be found again. I have so much idiotic shit to atone for that randomly crops up on my time hop. Count your blessings. Yeah, I get why your saying. I think us older millennials appreciate the technology more because we remember life without it. Some of these younger kids now just take it for granted. "Meh, kids these days! They take everything for granted!" -us Damn son, I guess we old as fuck now. Dude, yes. I couldn't agree more. I'll never forget getting on AOL for the first time lol (1993) this is the part of my childhood i really do not miss. I remember when GTA Vice City came out. I made a promise to myself never to use a cheat code ever again. After I beat it, I knew I could do anything. Then GTA: SA came out and that goddamn dirtbike could never keep up with that train no matter what i did. I don't play video games anymore, but I did beat 4 and 5 on my own just to maintain some sort of balance inside my head that I don't need no Gamepro magazine to help me through life. Yeah. I remember running out to my dad as he came home from work yelling and bragging that I had beaten Quake 1 before him. I had used /impulse9 (all weapons) and /noclip (run through walls). He was not impressed. You'd have to wait until someone was off the dialup internet first. You could even call a tip hotline. The number was usually printed on the manual of the game somewhere. For under $1.00/minute, you could call the hotline and they would help you solve the more difficult puzzles. Being a gamer in the 90's was hard work. I miss it, though. Before you could Google (or rather, AskJeeves or Yahoo or Lycos) how to beat a game, you had to figure it out. And it was super-satisfying to know you'd figured it out yourself. Many games were hard too, you get get stuck for hours or days. It's a shame now that any bit you can't beat in a game is solved by a quick search. Now everything has a waypoint system as well, making finding important locations trivial. I remember a quest back in vanilla WoW that gave info on landmarks you had to follow to find a NPC somewhere in the woods. Now it just puts a marker on the map. You'd lift the receiver off the hook, give the magneto generator a few cranks, then, speaking clearly into the transmitter, politely introduce yourself to Marjorie the operator and ask to be connected to Geoffrey person-to-person. It's not hard. Automated switching happened because the guy who invented it ran a funeral parlor and the operator kept connecting people to his competitor because operator was competetor's relative. That's great ingenuity. A lot of people would just sue. Not invent. Oh, man... This brings back memories of adventure games back in the 1980's. Zork, Ultima, that sort of thing. If you got stuck, you had to rely on hint books that game developers published. Two stories here: (1) InvisiClues - a series of hint books that used invisible ink to hide the answers. You used a special marker to reveal them, but only for questions that you really needed answered. The authors would load up the books with red-herring questions and nonsensical answers to deter cheating. Lots of fun. (2) A gaming hint book compendium - basically, people bundled up hints for solving lots of games, and sold them together. My family had a computer and some games, but not much disposable income - not enough to blow on those kinds of books. So whenever I ran into an unsolvable puzzle, I'd wait for the next trip to the mall, then visit the bookstore and get the hint I needed from the hint book on the shelf. You would use the landline in your parents' house to call other landlines where your friends' parents would pick up. You would then proceed to ask if your friend could come to the phone so you could fish for answers. Alternatively you'd take the bus into town, pick up some games magazine and pray to Jesus that it contained a walkthrough or some cheat codes. I got kicked out of the local Blockbuster because I would go in and copy cheat codes from the code books. There I was, flying down on my stomach, pencil in hand, transcribing the entire book by hand like a Franciscan monk. I'm imagining a young person laying down on a skateboard "flying" around the blockbuster while copying down cheat codes. That's exactly how the 90's were. Everyone just belly flying on skateboards. Only 90's kids remeber When they weren't slamming pogs on their friends punk asses you mean... Blockbuster had cheat codes? I remember the game consoles, but actual cheat books seem out of place. Yeah, have you never seen a comprehensive cheat book? They used to be everywhere even up to the early 2000's. They had nearly every mainstream game in them separated out by console with all the cheat codes. Still have an old game Genie book for the NES. Pages and pages of arcane incantations (aka strings of hex) to make everything easier. Are you sure you weren't kicked out for flying inside the store? Other customers kinda don't appreciate kids whizzing around the place. Every christmas on my list was for a year subscription to NINTENDO POWER for that reason! The fuck is a landline?

The Snowman is the character that sticks out in my memory. Here's something for the nostalgia trip. Neverhood's Soundtrack Thank so much for this bro, I just got crazy chills listening to that. The crazy thing is I remember each track and know where a few of them play specifically in the map haha. Fuck they need to rerelease The Neverhood. Oh yeah I member. Loved that game.

From the DoomWik: "This program was initially used by Adrian Carmack to capture the eight needed rotation frames of his hand-sculpted clay models. The model would be placed inside a brightly lit white box on a rotating modeling stand and then captured through video into the program. The resulting images were "distorted,"[1] and in substantial need of touch-ups. When the clay modeling process proved too slow to be practical, the program still proved itself useful for capturing images of the metal-and-latex miniatures created by Gregor Punchatz. Other items captured included shots of Kevin Cloud wielding various plastic toy guns which became the basis of Doom's weapons, Tom Hall's girlfriend's Eager Beaver chainsaw, a pair of snake skin boots, and a bloody scab on Kevin's knee - the latter two became parts of various wall textures." If you are interested in the making of Doom and the history of id software I can't recommend the book Masters of Doom enough. I never realized those spider masterminds had hands. It must suck to have an itch I did not know this, wow! That mane tho Thanks for sharing this, pretty cool! This is often done in animation, but more as a reference model than an actual product that gets photographed.

So, Kiby's made of clay, Yoshi's made of yarn, Mario's made of paper... has someone at Nintendo accidentally locked themselves in an arts and crafts store and this is their way of asking for help?

When I first got my N64 the only two games I had for so long were Mario 64 and Clayfighter. I put so many hours into Clay Fighter do you still have the 64 version? worth a penny now I believe Just checked it on Amazon. Pretty cheap if you don't care about the box or the special edition. Special edition is $3000 with the box. I'm not sure if I should pick up the SNES or the 64 version though. The sculptors cut was exclusive to blockbuster. I have the Sculptor's Cut version. Don't have the box, unfortunately. I had no idea what it was worth until recently! Clay fighter was the fucking tits Let's get ready to cruuumble! God I miss that game First thing I thought of....Bad Mr. Frosty 4 lyfe Git em kitty! Clayfighter was awesome! Hell yes. I remember my uncle getting me that for my birthday and how pissed my mother was. Good times. Wow! Thanks for Platypus I totally forgot about this game and I played it alot long time ago! Never had clayfighters but I had biofreaks. I remember it being awesome. It's not:( do you still have the 64 version? worth a penny now I believe Just checked it on Amazon.

I remember my uncle getting me that for my birthday and how pissed my mother was. Good times. Whaaaaaat, I had no idea that was the case! I haven't finished the game but came atleast halfway before real life interrupted me! Clay Jam! It was actually pretty good for a mobile game It's incredible, and you can still download it today, at least on Android. It's incredible, and you can still download it today, at least on Android. Came here to say this! For those who don't know, it's really cool because people can join the game with a smartphone as their controller. I believe you can even play 2 players using just one keyboard, or you can also add players using their phone as a controller (if they get the app which is pretty small I think). So it's kind of a cool idea; you can use a laptop and get a sweet party game going wherever. I've used it a couple times with my team on road trips. You mean Claymates? I'd definitely contribute to a crowdsourcing campaign. As long as I can just hit a button to donate and that's the end of it. Even if a full game doesn't get made it would be worth it as long as he releases tonnes of new animations. I've been burned a few times getting too personally involved in online creative investments and find the best way is to just donate a hundred bucks and forget about it for a year and hope you're pleasantly surprised. Otherwise you find yourself refreshing updates 10 times a day and getting way too stressed out and it just takes over your life. Its a bit like when you decide to buy bitcoins locally instead of through an exchange. You message a few people trying to get the best rate and you've finally got 3 who offer you a 5 percent markup. One guy offers a case of homemade port wine as part of the deal and that seals it. You meet of at his gorgeous country estate, give him your address 17q4HGtQSjuthrqWMsPzshyoNKkpmKRyrK and it clears in 10 minutes and you toast each other with a shot of port. The next thing you know you awake in a beautifully furnished but unfamiliar room. You get up and look for the door but find their isn't one. Just then your twin sister groggily comes too and as you lock eyes you hear a voice come over the intercom telling you not to worry. He's going to let you leave but you must pass a simple test, from a standing position you must ejaculate with enough force to touch the ceiling. You nervously laugh and tell him this is funny and all but just let us leave. Suddenly a computerized female voice intones "26" and you hear a moaning of gears and in an instant the walls contract 3 inches on both sides. Hahaha this isn't funny....silence. 3 hours later the voice intones "25" and the room contracts again. Jesus christ, realizing this lunatic is for real you tell your sister to hide her head under her pillow as you open up your laptop and search for "maria ozawa english interview" on youtube. You watch her done up in a classy dress talking about how shes having so much fun doing tv in indonesia and loves her fans, plus some random broll of her on set in between takes laughing with the camera man, you get a crush on her and almost forget the extreme porn she did before going to asiamoviepass and watching the high def preview of her "dream girlfriends" 30 guy bukkake scene and start furiously jacking off as if your life literally depended on it. You time your ejaculation to the exact height of arousal and see your sister hopefully poke a hopeful eye out of her pillow to spy on your ejaculations trajectory. At first there's hope but it stalls 2 feet short before glumly raining down on the marble floor. Over the next 3 days you try every combination of pornography and dark erotic fantasy you can conjure, you even try jumping off the bed as you ejaculate before a voice screams NO!!!! And the female voice intones 17 11 as the room contracts almost 2 feet. Food has been dropped through a hole in the ceiling this time and has enabled you to recover enough to continue ejaculating but by now your room has shrunken from a spacious hotel room to a room young Harry Potter would have found cramped. as the voice now intones "3" Your sister has long since stopped hiding her head and has instead been watching your beat off with intense hope, though you tried to hide it, you've become involuntarily aroused by her attention and even came within 7 inches of the ceiling once. But 7 inches seems like 7 miles and you've now switched from porn to tentacle hentai in a last ditch effort. You're staring intently at the protaganist being penetraded every possible way in the second episode of Angel Blade before a hand reaches out and shuts the laptop screen as another hand grabs your penis. You gasp and nearly ejaculate right there as tears fill your eyes and you shake your head "sis no, no!" It's ok, I'm your sister. I'm your sister, I AM YOUR SISTER. Tears fill her eyes too as she kneels and places your balls in her mouth and she removes her shirt and places your hand on her breast as her eyes beckon towards the ceiling. Your horror gives way to pure pleasure and you feel an intense wave relief "we're going to live".... When you try to tell people to be wary about crowdfunding and then break out into a bitcoin-buying-gone-wrong-now-it's-about-incest story. I laughed, I cried, I came. BITCOIN GONE WRONG.

I'm pretty sure this qualifies for /r/bestof but I'm not certain.... How it went from donations to incest is beyond me What did i just read. Either a copy-pasta, or the birth of a copy-pasta. I'd definitely contribute to a crowdsourcing campaign. As long as I can just hit a button to donate and that's the end of it. Even if a full game doesn't get made it would be worth it as long as he releases tonnes of new animations. I've been burned a few times getting too personally involved in online creative investments and find the best way is to just donate a hundred bucks and forget about it for a year and hope you're pleasantly surprised. Otherwise you find yourself refreshing updates 10 times a day and getting way too stressed out and it just takes over your life. Everyone is talking about the weirdness of everything after this bit, but this is absolutely excellent advice for backing Kickstarters. If you find a KS that looks good and think the devs can deliver (be sure to research first!), donate and then just forget about it.

If it's claymation and it's disgustingly violent, it's gotta be Lee Hardcastle. I have no idea how that guy cranks this stuff out, either. He's a beast. Have you seen his video for NIGHTMARE? His stuff can get a bit cartoonish at times (intentionally so, I guess), but this one's just excellent. Whoah. That was something else. Check out this one. Always been my favorite. Although all the videos he's done is worth checking out. https://youtu.be/y_z3EBalwI4 mew mew... MEW MEW! Thank you Yeah, I guessed as much as soon as I saw it.

He originally made "Pingu's The Thing" but the copyright holders for Pingu made him take it down. He also made Frozen The Thing which has been around reddit before. He does good work. But godddamn, if that Simpsons one didn't leave me sick to my stomach. Simpsons couch gag Warning: you think it sounds silly and everyone are just overreacting for the karma. But they're not. Im not going to lie. When i saw that, i felt some of my humanity leave. Am I just dead inside, or was that not as bad as everyone seems to think it is Did nothing for me. Couldn't even get hard. 0/10. Well why the hell did I watch that?! My damned curiosity got the better of me and I regret it. That was awful! I'm assuming it's NSFW It's soft emotional music played over legitimately disturbing gore. So, yes. A simpsons snuff film. Ah fuck. I can't believe you've done this. Classic Chief Wiggum! There is no unseeing that I knew this reminded me of that for a reason. Not much horror stuff really rattles me, but that fucked me up for the night. I've never seen The Thing (saw the prequel though) but I vividly remember the first time watching Claycat's version and being deeply disturbed by the scene where three of them are tied up and one is revealed to be the thing. Holy shit, that would be insane to be tied up to someone and find out that they're a monster! The movie is really good, and horrifying. The mutation effects are extremely well done, along with great scene writing like the one you described. Do yourself a favor and give it a watch sometime, if you can stomach the psychological gore horror. You should see The Thing. It is fantastic; way better than the prequel Yeah I heard, and I'm always down to watch whatever Kurt Russell is starring in. I guess I'll just wait until it's on Netflix again. You should watch the original then. That's the best scene. Oh yea! He's the guy who made one of my favourite music videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0WLFpIQ0o0 edit: this one started playing while I was posting. It's actually fucking awesome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71xpQUFgk_k Not to mention this wicked music video for Gunship - Tech Noir. Now I have to go watch The Raid again. I recommend that movie to everyone and they look at me like I'm retarded or soemthing. They have no taste I guess.

Rip and tear, Gromit! Doughn't tempt me, OP Now that's a name I haven't heard in years HEY DAVEEEE YOU GONNA EAT THAT SALAD? This is the tragedy of war. And then we began to wait for 2-3 years for the game to be finished. Bruh im still waiting for the last fucking guardian.... then you only have to wait for 2 more days. I don't think you understand how damaged we have been by Team ICO. yeah nine years really is crazy, the game was supposed to be made for ps3 Well if FFXV is an example the wait will be worht it. Mr. Nukem would like a word with you. Cmon now, this is Team Ico. They have two masterpieces and NOTHING ELSE. First time for everything, lets hope it's not for the Last Guardian. totally agreed there. I really hope it turns out as great as the other two. There's a part of me that's really worried when I see gameplay, though. something just feels slightly... off. hopefully it clicks more once it's in hand. I think linear is the word you're looking for. Tight corridors and bridges is where a lot of the footage takes place. My hope is that the AI will feel real enough so that the world feels organic regardless of your predetermined path. I haven't looked at stuff in a few months because I don't have a ps4, but when I did the movement really bothered me. Walking and running just looks like it would feel awful. Duke Nukem 3D was also a masterpiece of its time. "Shake it baby" space bar "Shake it baby" space bar Mom comes in the room "... shit shit shit shit shit alt tab alt tab alt tab" "You still beating up the bad guys hun?" "Yep sure am. Mmm hmm. Beating them up real good" That game is friggin awesome. Hell, I still play it using Yang. Half Life 3. I probably won't see it before I die and I'm only 23 and in perfect health. I would like a statement from your doctor confirming this. I'm his doctor, can confirm, he will die before Half life 3 is released Hi I am the doctor. Just let me get my gloves. Doom Guy showed Mr. Nukem how to git gud while waiting. Doom guy doesnt give a crap about our opinions idspispopd what you did there. Is that word bubblegum? Thats why I used FFXV (and I secretly liked the part of Forever that I've played sssshhhhhh) I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and i'm all out of gum! I've been exceptionally pleased with FFXV. It really is a Final Fantasy for Fans and First-Timers. I WANT TO RIDE MY CHOCOBO ALL DAY <3 Prompto and his love for Chocobo's. Iwant to know if those have ever been lyrics for it or if he just made up his own lyrics to this song He sings that so often it refuses to leave my head as well. So far, XV hasn't had anything outrageously broken for being in development for 10 years. That's usually not the case. Look at Duke Nukem or Gran Turismo 5. I agree with you about Duke Nukem, but what was wrong with GT5? (I joined in just before update 2.0, by the way. No launch experience) Launch day was sort of... meh. It wasn't boring or completely broken (atleast for me), but the game seemed like there were things missing. One of my favorite parts was the photo mode. A big disappointment about it though was that not all cars would be available in photo mode (c'mon Bugatti) and you couldn't check out the interior. I think the update fixed a lot of things though. 9 years. Cute. Tell us Tool fans about waiting... Hey bro we have to wait 10.000 days in total. So we only have about 2/3 to go Fuck don't say that... Beatles fan here, still waiting... Mega man legends fan here... All I can do is cry I've waited across almost 10 years and two console generations for FF XV (since back when it was called FF vs XIII) and now that it's finally coming out, I'm too broke to afford to buy it Half-Life players still have you beat by 2 years. And that is from a cliffhanger ending. The worst part is that with the portal series they sort of added tiny snippets of seeds of hope into the potential HL3 game. I've held off buying a ps4 for this game.. Looking forward to the ps9 Buy it for Bloodborne You should buy it for Bloodborne. At least you'll be able to enjoy this seven year old penny arcade strip one more time: http://imgur.com/a/AVWqq One more day and then we can all go back to waiting for Half Life 3 At this point? Fuck valve we don't want it anymore. Sometimes I wonder if the Halflife style still would translate or if the hypetrain would derail it like Duke Nukem Forever Half-Life Forever confirmed! The world's first open world, sandbox FPSMMO...with hats! One word friend. Planetside 2! Is Planetside 2 still going? My wife and I had a blast playing it when it first came out - we'd generally run around as a squad of 2 either in a Sunderer or a bike and plant mines on undefended enemy Sunderers until the player base complained that undefended forward spawn points were too easy to kill and fitting mine guard was too hard apparently so Sony nerfed mines into the ground. It was a shame. Apparently telling people to shoot the guys coming to attack the bus was not a viable tactic. I think it would but not necessarily in the way we are used to. Gabe made a comment once about how Valve views their IP as tools in a toolbox to show off other things. I think that's exactly why we haven't had HF3. As great as it would have been it, there is no new technologies or mediums that it could showcase, other than the standard better graphics. I think if and when we do see it, it will be to showcase some new generation defining technology - like the first Source engine defined and created so many games for 10 years plus. Maybe that will be VR, maybe it will be something else. Lets hope that if they make HL3 they would round up the story. This whole thing has been a joke. I waited 10 years for Final Fantasy XV, and it was worth it for me. As long as they get TLG right, I don't mind the wait personally. But the wait is always worth it. Especially since it's Naughty Dog. They make good fucking shit. Uncharted 4 was amazing and they could top TLoU with part II. Seriously I will wait for however long it takes, I wouldn't want to rush the masters at work! Better make it 3-4 years. Gotta factor in wait time for the 40Gb release day patch. You can't rush great games. When ND delays their games, they have the best intentions in mind. If it needs that long to be perfect I'm okay waiting. I can't wait for the post about not pre-ordering. I shit you not morning of the trailers release, open up shop and within 20 mins this teen comes running in asking to preorder last of us 2 and when I told him it wont be in my system considering it was announced fucking 20 minutes ago he asked to leave money behind with his name just in case, like c'mon dude you could pre order it in a year and still have a copy aside It was an IRL 'Shut up and take my money' I'd honor the fuck out of this agreement. I dont pre-order at all any more. mostly because i never have not been able to get a copy of a game in the past few years. they've really got distribution figured out anymore, there's no point. There is if you live in rural areas where they still stock based on pre-orders as a sign of local interest. It doesn't matter everywhere anymore but in many places it still does. Or if the game is a pokemon game. Shit goes out of stock so fast Toys "R" Us is a great place for this. I used to work in the electronics department there and the only game we ever ran out of for the three years I worked there was Super Smash Brothers 3DS. Never ran out of a Pokemon game nor Destiny at release (were were the only store in the city and it's surrounding towns that didn't). Same with Battlefront and Arkham Knight. No one thinks of Toys "R" Us for games, so they usually maintain stock pretty well. Too bad the only close Toys 'R' Us near me turned into a Babies 'R' Us. I still don't understand it, but I guess my area must have a shit ton of couples with nothing better to do Babies "R" Us do better with credit card apps and surprisingly have less theft problems so if a store really suffers there, it's not uncommon for them to change, especially if there's one less than 50 miles away from it. I see this in my local mall as well. The EB Games can be out of a game entirely, but go one level up to the Toys R Us and the shelves are full. TRU can be a hidden gem for finding games. Your local mall has an EB games AND a toys r us? Holy shit Back in the old days, Sears was the secret video game store. I just walked in and bought a PS2 there a couple of weeks after launch even as people were lining up in the early morning hours at Best Buy or EB Games hoping they'd get a shipment. I remember a calamity a few years ago when they had has the 3DS XL mislisted as on sale for $60 and everyone went to us and Best Buy to price match. That was the first time I realized Sears even sold video games. Eh, there are other bonuses. Amazon is 20% new releases with Prime, Best Buy is 20% all with GCU, couple that with most major releases get $10 with preorders and extra dlc. I mean, if it's a dev you trust, has good review scores, and something you are going to buy, why not? Plus if you don't do the whole midnight release thing, Amazon will send the game to your mailbox the day of release. Your first chance to play is typically after work anyway. Or just buy digital. Granted I can understand liking hard copies but unless the bombs drop there's still gonna be plenty of electrons to go around. €69.99 on PSN, €59.90 for a physical copy. Easy choice. The only problem with digital is downloading the thing. For a large game on a shitty network (origin, steam and blizzard apparently have amazing speeds compared to Sony and Microsoft) or your own capped or just plain slow broadband you could buy it and not get to play it until the next day. I preorder cause Amazon gives you 20% off Everybody wants to figurativelyshit on this kid, but sometimes you have the money now and you know you don't have the self control to save it for a year. But if you give it to the store, it's not burning a hole in your pocket. Or you could always be this guy. I don't want to shit on that kid. What if he's into it Pre-orders killed my family. My Documents > Copypastas > Pre-Ordering Honestly, [DEVELOPER] has a pretty clean track record. Just look at [GAME] or [GAME_2] and you'll see that pre-ordering is fine. 2relateable4me I personally still feel confident in pre-ordering from Naughty Dog because their track record is on point. They have never released a buggy unfinished game and they are one of my favorite game companies. I dare say that Naughty Dog of today is what Rare was in its prime. That would be the argument usually. But this was a dope ass first game in reddit's eyes. They are gonna create an exception for this game. Because reddit is filled with hypocrites. Edit: yes, it is hypocrisy because the argument is always "Don't pre-order". There is no tiny clause after stating what companies are good and bad to pre order from. I agree with the developers mentioned below. But it doesn't change the fact of the reddit hive mind on this subject. and all the Uncharteds, and the original Crash Bandicoots. Naughty Dog is a trusted dev who haven't made a bad game. It isn't an exception when they are consistently great. Is this before or after she tripped over Knack 2? Knack is back baby! After. You can see how she carries the disappointment in her eyes over Knack 1, which is only compounded by seeing an announcement for Knack 2. AND THEY'RE MAKING A KNACK 2. HA. NOW WHAT YOU GONNA DO? HA Here comes the money Ha, nice reference. I love how dunkey changed his review of the last of us in his uncharted 4 video. Oh man, $20 says Sony made it because of people making Dunkey references that went straight over their heads. Are we gonna see a direct sequel to Super Mario Brothers 2 soon? We have to hold the beer because she's still not 21 yet. Yeah because in the zombie apocalypse drinking ages are super well enforced Rules are rules mate And those who can't follow the rules get the Iron. I don't ever wanna have to do that again. That iron just got 50% hotter. Did you eat the iron's pussy like a lady? im just fucking with you, irons dont have pussies And those who can't follow the rules get the Iron hose again. I'd rather the hose than those jumper cables I keep hearing about. RIP in piece u/rogersimon10 Shut that shit down http://Imgur.com/a/MY210 http://i.imgur.com/7HwdEOX.jpg I admittedly know very little on how to make gifs. I'm 19 and I can buy legally alcohol, so obviously I'm from Canada. Or Europe, or pretty much anywhere that isn't the states It's pretty mental that you can legally join the army, go shoot someone, come back, run for mayor, star in a bunch of porno films and still not be considered mature enough to drink a beer tbh. So I bought this game last year and when I saw that part II was coming out, I decided to actually sit down and play it. I started playing it at like 3pm yesterday. I stopped at like 5am when I realized I worked in 3 hours. Damn this game is fucking gripping. So fucking awesome. Need to go home right now and finish it :\ Edit: The game is 'The Last of Us' (Playstation Exclusive). The image refers to the teaser of 'The Last Of Us II' now being in development by Naughty Dog. It's a zombie survival game that won like every award on the planet. Wiki Link The multiplayer had surprising immersion to it as well. It's rough now but I hope it comes back with improvements. I liked how appropriately brutal the multiplayer meta game was. "Had a rough day? Not as rough as your clan. They're dead now." Put your Facebook info in and your mom just died because you lost a game. A few years ago my then-girlfriend died from dysentery. My mother was considering cannibalism. Great times. How come you waited a year before playing it? I've been addicted to Destiny since I bought it in 2014, lol. I also bought Arkham Knight when it came out and just got around to that as well. Also a pretty cool game. Yep im in the same boat dude. Got 400 on 3 guys, started batman, beat it. Now on to bloodborne, and playing BF1 also. I also still have just cause 3 in the wrapper from last year.... Is it a long game? 15-18 hours, DLC is 2-3 hours. Surprisingly yea! I have no idea how close I am to the end, but I thought for sure I'd have finished it by now. Everytime I think the game is over (now that I'm know there's a part II I keep expecting the game to end in a cliffhanger), the game keeps going. Some pretty crazy twist and turns plotwise. Also, this is the first ever 'survival' game that I've not used google to solve some puzzles for me. Heh. So that's cool - nothing is too hard to solve. Naughty dog is really, really good at this. This game (along with the whole Uncharted series) just feels like a gigantic movie that you play through. Cinematic details are incredible and the stories really pull you into the world. You forgot KNACK 2 BABY! BAYBEEEEEEEEE! Fixed that for you. Still waiting for kingdomhearts for the PS4. hope you're still in prime shape at 80 years old But "hold my beer" is for prefacing bad decisions.... Or doing something fucking gnarly! Cool. Now I can get a second game on my PS4. Me too! My first was No Mans Sky :( pats back There there. They can't hurt you anymore Where is your Bloodborne or Uncharted 4 buddy? :( lol :(( My PS4 is behind 2 or 3 system updates. In 2 years when this game releases, I might have sold it already. We'll see though. I'll give you the $31 that I have in my wallet Sold At least I can change my ID on Xbox. I'm still stuck with the same name I came up with in high school. That was awhile ago. It's embarrassing now! Let me change my name, Sony! More embarrassing than poopoobagoo? Ffs! I've been waiting to change my name to that! try poopoobagoo420 or poopoobagoo69, those are equally good Needs more X's and underscores. Wait seriously? I borrowed my friends' ps3 in high school and made an account just so I could sign in, and I got a ps4 a little while ago and have yet to bother trying to change the name. Can you really not do it at all? Am I seriously stuck with IM_BATMAANN ? edit: accidentall forgt a ltter Still better then tigerman2013 not_bruce_wayne IM_BATMAANN You are really bad at keeping your identity a secret. But then, I love Batmaann so I ain't complainin' What do you mean? My user name is pretty straight forward. I am Batman but I am not, repeat: am NOT Bruce Wayne. I mean, im buying this game but this post is fucking stupid People who post this type of shit aren't even old enough to drink. Hold my Capri Sun. The vast majority of people who post, vote and comment in this sub aren't old enough to drink. You're posting on an internet forum devoted to video games, cat pictures, and memes. At some point you've got to stop making fun of younger people and realize that maybe you're the one out of place. Look at all these stupid kids in the ball pit! I never understood why fans get involved in the console wars. Both consoles are essentially the same. I own both, because they're both great. I own both RIP Wii U As someone who owns all 3 I don't get that hate on Wii U. It's an amazing shelf warmer. (But seriously Mario cart will always be amazing) I love my Wii U. Wind waker remaster, twilight princess remaster, super mario 3d world was one of the best mario games ever, mario maker is excellent, splatoon is fun, smash bros, and Mario Kart 8. I wish it wasn't dead and didnt have such a horrible life because it was a good console. Here's to hoping there's some "ambassador program" for the wii u on the switch as a thank you for supporting them. I hope the prices go down when the switch is released so I can grab one. For perspective. Splatoon has sold as many copies as Uncharted 4, which is currently the best-selling PS4 game. Splatoon is the sixth best-selling Wii U game. The Wii U certainly didn't sell many machines, but a hell of a lot of people seem to want those games... Wii U and PC are my favorite combination. I feel like I get enough exclusives and it satisfies my console itch. I feel like i see this exact comment every single time i see a thread about console wars pertaining to the X1 and PS4. Probably because X1 and PS4 are both PC-like while Nintendo brings something new to the table, along with a slew of Nintendo exclusives. I haven't had a console in years but bloodborne really makes me sad =( Not everyone has that much money, poeple want the best one for their money, thus debate. I have the Xbox One and the only quarrel I have with it is no Spotify app :( I was a stupid fan boy (of ps2 then xbox 360) until my brother got a ps4 and i gifted him an xbox one. Both are great consoles. If I had to pick one I'd pick xbox, simply because in my house we have a windows 10 computer as a media center in the living room and my bedroom. Point is, yes, the consoles differ a bit. But which console is better for you is entirely subjective. Owning both is also a nice option if the money isn't an issue. Running my comcast cable through my Xbox is the best thing ever. I run a harmony and I can run from a bluray, to cable, to netflix, to streaming music, to youtube videos, all without changing inputs or controllers. It's amazing. But one console has a better controller so obviously everything about that console makes it better. You're talking about the Gamecube, right? Gamesphere* IT'S SPHERICAL Are you saying it with Emphasis? EMPHASIS! No lie, the Gamecube has one of the best controllers. My pointer fingers would like a word with you. I was actually a Sony guy (I still like Xbox, but I thought the PS3/4 exclusives were more interesting) but even I can't deny the Xbox controller is light years better. Now I have a PC and I recently got an Xbox One gamepad and MAN those triggers are nice. Luckily I still have a PS4 collecting dust that I can use when TLOU part 2 is released! The Xbox (and formerly Dreamcast) layout is just more ergonomic. The PS4 controller is just an updated dualshock, which itself was basically a PlayStation 1 controller with two sticks stuck onto the bottom. The prime position on the pad is occupied by the face buttons on the right and the DPAD on the left, which since the invention of sticks has been a secondary input area at best in most genres. On Xbox, your thumbs naturally rest on the two most important control areas in 90% of games - the left stick, which controls movement, and the face buttons which are usually attack/jump/brake/drift/dodge/block/use ability. Well to be fair the 360 controller was awesome in everyway. I enjoy the ps4 controller now but I love having the analog stick higher Meanwhile, Nintendo's like, "It's-a me! Mario 'I'm-sold-out-everywhere-even-though-it's-only-8-bits' Mario!" Which is weird given Project Scorpio is coming out next year. You'd think people would wait and be buying PS4 Pros right now. Well the Scorpio looks to be significantly stronger than the Pro, so who knows what the market will look like in one year's time. i'm never going to understand giving the slightest fuck about which console sells more. facepalm Unless you've actually got shares in either Sony or Microsoft, why do people actually care so much about which multi million pound corporation is making the most money? Is it because of how warm your beer is going to get while it sits in your hand for 3 years before this comes out? Greatness awaits. Who upvotes this garbage low effort shit HI WELCOME TO /R/GAMING Legit question here guys: I have TLoU, but never got around finishing it. I'm still early in the game. Mainly because it got too scary for me at times, all this jump scare shit has always been terrifying to me. Is knowing the fact that the kid doesn't die in it gonna ruin the game for me if I decide to play it? No, understanding why she doesn't die is important. Understanding why she doesn't die is the entire payoff of four seasons of bonding in hell [deleted] I'm easily scared by horror movies and games that's why I couldn't play any longer. Thank you for your answer. So am I, man. But honestly, there's only one scene in this game that really got me - just so you're prepared, turn on all the lights in your house and be ready when you're in a basement at the bottom of an elevator shaft. I've played though the game 3 times now, and that scene makes my heart race every time. Xbox momentum has been such that people seem to be as hyped about Red Dead Redemption and Mass Effect being backwards compatible than new games even like TLoU2 I have a feeling the Scorpio will take the market. Guess I need to read more gaming articles or something to follow along....? Better get ready to hold that beer until 2018/19 🍺 Bruh im still waiting for the last fucking guardian.... then you only have to wait for 2 more days. I don't think you understand how damaged we have been by Team ICO. yeah nine years really is crazy, the game was supposed to be made for ps3 Well if FFXV is an example the wait will be worht it. Mr. Nukem would like a word with you. Cmon now, this is Team Ico. They have two masterpieces and NOTHING ELSE. First time for everything, lets hope it's not for the Last Guardian. totally agreed there. I really hope it turns out as great as the other two. There's a part of me that's really worried when I see gameplay, though. something just feels slightly... off. hopefully it clicks more once it's in hand. I think linear is the word you're looking for. Tight corridors and bridges is where a lot of the footage takes place. My hope is that the AI will feel real enough so that the world feels organic regardless of your predetermined path. I haven't looked at stuff in a few months because I don't have a ps4, but when I did the movement really bothered me. Walking and running just looks like it would feel awful. Duke Nukem 3D was also a masterpiece of its time. "Shake it baby" space bar "Shake it baby" space bar Mom comes in the room "... shit shit shit shit shit alt tab alt tab alt tab" "You still beating up the bad guys hun?" "Yep sure am. Mmm hmm. Beating them up real good" That game is friggin awesome. Hell, I still play it using Yang. Half Life 3. I probably won't see it before I die and I'm only 23 and in perfect health. I would like a statement from your doctor confirming this. I'm his doctor, can confirm, he will die before Half life 3 is released Hi I am the doctor. Just let me get my gloves. Doom Guy showed Mr. Nukem how to git gud while waiting. Doom guy doesnt give a crap about our opinions idspispopd what you did there. Is that word bubblegum? Thats why I used FFXV (and I secretly liked the part of Forever that I've played sssshhhhhh) I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and i'm all out of gum! I've been exceptionally pleased with FFXV. It really is a Final Fantasy for Fans and First-Timers. I WANT TO RIDE MY CHOCOBO ALL DAY <3 Prompto and his love for Chocobo's. Iwant to know if those have ever been lyrics for it or if he just made up his own lyrics to this song He sings that so often it refuses to leave my head as well. So far, XV hasn't had anything outrageously broken for being in development for 10 years. That's usually not the case. Look at Duke Nukem or Gran Turismo 5. I agree with you about Duke Nukem, but what was wrong with GT5? (I joined in just before update 2.0, by the way. No launch experience) Launch day was sort of... meh. It wasn't boring or completely broken (atleast for me), but the game seemed like there were things missing. One of my favorite parts was the photo mode. A big disappointment about it though was that not all cars would be available in photo mode (c'mon Bugatti) and you couldn't check out the interior. I think the update fixed a lot of things though. 9 years. Cute. Tell us Tool fans about waiting... Hey bro we have to wait 10.000 days in total. So we only have about 2/3 to go Fuck don't say that... Beatles fan here, still waiting... Mega man legends fan here... All I can do is cry I've waited across almost 10 years and two console generations for FF XV (since back when it was called FF vs XIII) and now that it's finally coming out, I'm too broke to afford to buy it Half-Life players still have you beat by 2 years. And that is from a cliffhanger ending. The worst part is that with the portal series they sort of added tiny snippets of seeds of hope into the potential HL3 game. I've held off buying a ps4 for this game.. Looking forward to the ps9 Buy it for Bloodborne You should buy it for Bloodborne. At least you'll be able to enjoy this seven year old penny arcade strip one more time: http://imgur.com/a/AVWqq One more day and then we can all go back to waiting for Half Life 3 At this point? Fuck valve we don't want it anymore. Sometimes I wonder if the Halflife style still would translate or if the hypetrain would derail it like Duke Nukem Forever Half-Life Forever confirmed! The world's first open world, sandbox FPSMMO...with hats! One word friend. Planetside 2! Is Planetside 2 still going? My wife and I had a blast playing it when it first came out - we'd generally run around as a squad of 2 either in a Sunderer or a bike and plant mines on undefended enemy Sunderers until the player base complained that undefended forward spawn points were too easy to kill and fitting mine guard was too hard apparently so Sony nerfed mines into the ground. It was a shame. Apparently telling people to shoot the guys coming to attack the bus was not a viable tactic. I think it would but not necessarily in the way we are used to. Gabe made a comment once about how Valve views their IP as tools in a toolbox to show off other things. I think that's exactly why we haven't had HF3. As great as it would have been it, there is no new technologies or mediums that it could showcase, other than the standard better graphics. I think if and when we do see it, it will be to showcase some new generation defining technology - like the first Source engine defined and created so many games for 10 years plus. Maybe that will be VR, maybe it will be something else. Lets hope that if they make HL3 they would round up the story. This whole thing has been a joke. I waited 10 years for Final Fantasy XV, and it was worth it for me. As long as they get TLG right, I don't mind the wait personally. But the wait is always worth it. Especially since it's Naughty Dog. They make good fucking shit. Uncharted 4 was amazing and they could top TLoU with part II. Seriously I will wait for however long it takes, I wouldn't want to rush the masters at work! Better make it 3-4 years. Gotta factor in wait time for the 40Gb release day patch. You can't rush great games. When ND delays their games, they have the best intentions in mind. If it needs that long to be perfect I'm okay waiting. then you only have to wait for 2 more days. I don't think you understand how damaged we have been by Team ICO. yeah nine years really is crazy, the game was supposed to be made for ps3 Well if FFXV is an example the wait will be worht it.

I think linear is the word you're looking for. Tight corridors and bridges is where a lot of the footage takes place. My hope is that the AI will feel real enough so that the world feels organic regardless of your predetermined path. I haven't looked at stuff in a few months because I don't have a ps4, but when I did the movement really bothered me. Walking and running just looks like it would feel awful. Duke Nukem 3D was also a masterpiece of its time. "Shake it baby" space bar "Shake it baby" space bar Mom comes in the room "... shit shit shit shit shit alt tab alt tab alt tab" "You still beating up the bad guys hun?" "Yep sure am. Mmm hmm. Beating them up real good" That game is friggin awesome. Hell, I still play it using Yang. I think linear is the word you're looking for.

I'm his doctor, can confirm, he will die before Half life 3 is released Hi I am the doctor. Just let me get my gloves.

Doom guy doesnt give a crap about our opinions idspispopd what you did there. <3 Prompto and his love for Chocobo's. Iwant to know if those have ever been lyrics for it or if he just made up his own lyrics to this song He sings that so often it refuses to leave my head as well. I agree with you about Duke Nukem, but what was wrong with GT5? (I joined in just before update 2.0, by the way. No launch experience) Launch day was sort of... meh. It wasn't boring or completely broken (atleast for me), but the game seemed like there were things missing. One of my favorite parts was the photo mode. A big disappointment about it though was that not all cars would be available in photo mode (c'mon Bugatti) and you couldn't check out the interior. I think the update fixed a lot of things though.

Hey bro we have to wait 10.000 days in total. So we only have about 2/3 to go Fuck don't say that... Beatles fan here, still waiting... Mega man legends fan here... All I can do is cry Fuck don't say that... Mega man legends fan here... All I can do is cry The worst part is that with the portal series they sort of added tiny snippets of seeds of hope into the potential HL3 game. Buy it for Bloodborne You should buy it for Bloodborne. At this point? Fuck valve we don't want it anymore. Sometimes I wonder if the Halflife style still would translate or if the hypetrain would derail it like Duke Nukem Forever Half-Life Forever confirmed! The world's first open world, sandbox FPSMMO...with hats! One word friend. Planetside 2! Is Planetside 2 still going? My wife and I had a blast playing it when it first came out - we'd generally run around as a squad of 2 either in a Sunderer or a bike and plant mines on undefended enemy Sunderers until the player base complained that undefended forward spawn points were too easy to kill and fitting mine guard was too hard apparently so Sony nerfed mines into the ground. It was a shame. Apparently telling people to shoot the guys coming to attack the bus was not a viable tactic. I think it would but not necessarily in the way we are used to. Gabe made a comment once about how Valve views their IP as tools in a toolbox to show off other things. I think that's exactly why we haven't had HF3. As great as it would have been it, there is no new technologies or mediums that it could showcase, other than the standard better graphics. I think if and when we do see it, it will be to showcase some new generation defining technology - like the first Source engine defined and created so many games for 10 years plus. Maybe that will be VR, maybe it will be something else. Lets hope that if they make HL3 they would round up the story. This whole thing has been a joke.

Seriously I will wait for however long it takes, I wouldn't want to rush the masters at work! You can't rush great games. When ND delays their games, they have the best intentions in mind. I shit you not morning of the trailers release, open up shop and within 20 mins this teen comes running in asking to preorder last of us 2 and when I told him it wont be in my system considering it was announced fucking 20 minutes ago he asked to leave money behind with his name just in case, like c'mon dude you could pre order it in a year and still have a copy aside It was an IRL 'Shut up and take my money' I'd honor the fuck out of this agreement. I dont pre-order at all any more. mostly because i never have not been able to get a copy of a game in the past few years. they've really got distribution figured out anymore, there's no point. There is if you live in rural areas where they still stock based on pre-orders as a sign of local interest. It doesn't matter everywhere anymore but in many places it still does. Or if the game is a pokemon game. Shit goes out of stock so fast Toys "R" Us is a great place for this. I used to work in the electronics department there and the only game we ever ran out of for the three years I worked there was Super Smash Brothers 3DS. Never ran out of a Pokemon game nor Destiny at release (were were the only store in the city and it's surrounding towns that didn't). Same with Battlefront and Arkham Knight. No one thinks of Toys "R" Us for games, so they usually maintain stock pretty well. Too bad the only close Toys 'R' Us near me turned into a Babies 'R' Us. I still don't understand it, but I guess my area must have a shit ton of couples with nothing better to do Babies "R" Us do better with credit card apps and surprisingly have less theft problems so if a store really suffers there, it's not uncommon for them to change, especially if there's one less than 50 miles away from it. I see this in my local mall as well. The EB Games can be out of a game entirely, but go one level up to the Toys R Us and the shelves are full. TRU can be a hidden gem for finding games. Your local mall has an EB games AND a toys r us? Holy shit Back in the old days, Sears was the secret video game store. I just walked in and bought a PS2 there a couple of weeks after launch even as people were lining up in the early morning hours at Best Buy or EB Games hoping they'd get a shipment. I remember a calamity a few years ago when they had has the 3DS XL mislisted as on sale for $60 and everyone went to us and Best Buy to price match. That was the first time I realized Sears even sold video games. Eh, there are other bonuses. Amazon is 20% new releases with Prime, Best Buy is 20% all with GCU, couple that with most major releases get $10 with preorders and extra dlc. I mean, if it's a dev you trust, has good review scores, and something you are going to buy, why not? Plus if you don't do the whole midnight release thing, Amazon will send the game to your mailbox the day of release. Your first chance to play is typically after work anyway. Or just buy digital. Granted I can understand liking hard copies but unless the bombs drop there's still gonna be plenty of electrons to go around. €69.99 on PSN, €59.90 for a physical copy. Easy choice. The only problem with digital is downloading the thing. For a large game on a shitty network (origin, steam and blizzard apparently have amazing speeds compared to Sony and Microsoft) or your own capped or just plain slow broadband you could buy it and not get to play it until the next day. I preorder cause Amazon gives you 20% off Everybody wants to figurativelyshit on this kid, but sometimes you have the money now and you know you don't have the self control to save it for a year. But if you give it to the store, it's not burning a hole in your pocket. Or you could always be this guy. I don't want to shit on that kid. What if he's into it Pre-orders killed my family. My Documents > Copypastas > Pre-Ordering Honestly, [DEVELOPER] has a pretty clean track record. Just look at [GAME] or [GAME_2] and you'll see that pre-ordering is fine. 2relateable4me I personally still feel confident in pre-ordering from Naughty Dog because their track record is on point. They have never released a buggy unfinished game and they are one of my favorite game companies. I dare say that Naughty Dog of today is what Rare was in its prime. That would be the argument usually. But this was a dope ass first game in reddit's eyes. They are gonna create an exception for this game. Because reddit is filled with hypocrites. Edit: yes, it is hypocrisy because the argument is always "Don't pre-order". There is no tiny clause after stating what companies are good and bad to pre order from. I agree with the developers mentioned below. But it doesn't change the fact of the reddit hive mind on this subject. and all the Uncharteds, and the original Crash Bandicoots. Naughty Dog is a trusted dev who haven't made a bad game. It isn't an exception when they are consistently great. It was an IRL 'Shut up and take my money' I'd honor the fuck out of this agreement.

The multiplayer had surprising immersion to it as well. It's rough now but I hope it comes back with improvements. I liked how appropriately brutal the multiplayer meta game was. "Had a rough day? Not as rough as your clan. They're dead now." Put your Facebook info in and your mom just died because you lost a game. A few years ago my then-girlfriend died from dysentery. My mother was considering cannibalism. Great times. How come you waited a year before playing it? I've been addicted to Destiny since I bought it in 2014, lol. I also bought Arkham Knight when it came out and just got around to that as well. Also a pretty cool game. Yep im in the same boat dude. Got 400 on 3 guys, started batman, beat it. Now on to bloodborne, and playing BF1 also. I also still have just cause 3 in the wrapper from last year.... Is it a long game? 15-18 hours, DLC is 2-3 hours. Surprisingly yea! I have no idea how close I am to the end, but I thought for sure I'd have finished it by now. Everytime I think the game is over (now that I'm know there's a part II I keep expecting the game to end in a cliffhanger), the game keeps going. Some pretty crazy twist and turns plotwise. Also, this is the first ever 'survival' game that I've not used google to solve some puzzles for me. Heh. So that's cool - nothing is too hard to solve. Naughty dog is really, really good at this. This game (along with the whole Uncharted series) just feels like a gigantic movie that you play through. Cinematic details are incredible and the stories really pull you into the world.

I also bought Arkham Knight when it came out and just got around to that as well. Also a pretty cool game. Yep im in the same boat dude. Got 400 on 3 guys, started batman, beat it. Now on to bloodborne, and playing BF1 also. I also still have just cause 3 in the wrapper from last year.... Yep im in the same boat dude. Got 400 on 3 guys, started batman, beat it. Now on to bloodborne, and playing BF1 also. I also still have just cause 3 in the wrapper from last year.... 15-18 hours, DLC is 2-3 hours. Surprisingly yea! I have no idea how close I am to the end, but I thought for sure I'd have finished it by now. Everytime I think the game is over (now that I'm know there's a part II I keep expecting the game to end in a cliffhanger), the game keeps going. Some pretty crazy twist and turns plotwise. Also, this is the first ever 'survival' game that I've not used google to solve some puzzles for me. Heh. So that's cool - nothing is too hard to solve. Naughty dog is really, really good at this. This game (along with the whole Uncharted series) just feels like a gigantic movie that you play through. Cinematic details are incredible and the stories really pull you into the world.

Look at all these stupid kids in the ball pit! I own both RIP Wii U As someone who owns all 3 I don't get that hate on Wii U. It's an amazing shelf warmer. (But seriously Mario cart will always be amazing) I love my Wii U. Wind waker remaster, twilight princess remaster, super mario 3d world was one of the best mario games ever, mario maker is excellent, splatoon is fun, smash bros, and Mario Kart 8. I wish it wasn't dead and didnt have such a horrible life because it was a good console. Here's to hoping there's some "ambassador program" for the wii u on the switch as a thank you for supporting them. I hope the prices go down when the switch is released so I can grab one. For perspective. Splatoon has sold as many copies as Uncharted 4, which is currently the best-selling PS4 game. Splatoon is the sixth best-selling Wii U game. The Wii U certainly didn't sell many machines, but a hell of a lot of people seem to want those games... Wii U and PC are my favorite combination. I feel like I get enough exclusives and it satisfies my console itch. I feel like i see this exact comment every single time i see a thread about console wars pertaining to the X1 and PS4. Probably because X1 and PS4 are both PC-like while Nintendo brings something new to the table, along with a slew of Nintendo exclusives. I haven't had a console in years but bloodborne really makes me sad =( Not everyone has that much money, poeple want the best one for their money, thus debate. I have the Xbox One and the only quarrel I have with it is no Spotify app :( I was a stupid fan boy (of ps2 then xbox 360) until my brother got a ps4 and i gifted him an xbox one. Both are great consoles. If I had to pick one I'd pick xbox, simply because in my house we have a windows 10 computer as a media center in the living room and my bedroom. Point is, yes, the consoles differ a bit. But which console is better for you is entirely subjective. Owning both is also a nice option if the money isn't an issue. Running my comcast cable through my Xbox is the best thing ever. I run a harmony and I can run from a bluray, to cable, to netflix, to streaming music, to youtube videos, all without changing inputs or controllers. It's amazing. But one console has a better controller so obviously everything about that console makes it better. You're talking about the Gamecube, right? Gamesphere* IT'S SPHERICAL Are you saying it with Emphasis? EMPHASIS! No lie, the Gamecube has one of the best controllers. My pointer fingers would like a word with you. I was actually a Sony guy (I still like Xbox, but I thought the PS3/4 exclusives were more interesting) but even I can't deny the Xbox controller is light years better. Now I have a PC and I recently got an Xbox One gamepad and MAN those triggers are nice. Luckily I still have a PS4 collecting dust that I can use when TLOU part 2 is released! The Xbox (and formerly Dreamcast) layout is just more ergonomic. The PS4 controller is just an updated dualshock, which itself was basically a PlayStation 1 controller with two sticks stuck onto the bottom. The prime position on the pad is occupied by the face buttons on the right and the DPAD on the left, which since the invention of sticks has been a secondary input area at best in most genres. On Xbox, your thumbs naturally rest on the two most important control areas in 90% of games - the left stick, which controls movement, and the face buttons which are usually attack/jump/brake/drift/dodge/block/use ability. Well to be fair the 360 controller was awesome in everyway. I enjoy the ps4 controller now but I love having the analog stick higher As someone who owns all 3 I don't get that hate on Wii U.

Well the Scorpio looks to be significantly stronger than the Pro, so who knows what the market will look like in one year's time. HI WELCOME TO /R/GAMING No, understanding why she doesn't die is important. Understanding why she doesn't die is the entire payoff of four seasons of bonding in hell [deleted] I'm easily scared by horror movies and games that's why I couldn't play any longer. Thank you for your answer. So am I, man. But honestly, there's only one scene in this game that really got me - just so you're prepared, turn on all the lights in your house and be ready when you're in a basement at the bottom of an elevator shaft. I've played though the game 3 times now, and that scene makes my heart race every time.
