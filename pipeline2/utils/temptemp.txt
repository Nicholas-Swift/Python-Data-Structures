They left those VR goggles on him like removing them would be like pulling the plug while in the Matrix. Cuz if you die in VR you die in real life I almost fell over while playing Job Simulator on PSVR. 

I was running a convenience store. The hot dogs were way too far down and I may have tried to hold on to the counter to balance. 

There was no counter. 

Can't blame me for taking my job seriously.  Every time I see this I wonder why they try to get him on his feet again. "Hahaha! Got ya!"

"..."


"..."



"Dude, you're okay. Stop it now. Please?" What's the likelihood of this being authentic?  I just think of all those kids who will be pleasuring themselves wearing these headsets, oblivious to the fact that mom has entered the bedroom to round up dirty laundry.  "oh this is pretty realistic"

*Gets pushed*

"Holy fuck it's real! I'm not in a mall omg!!!"

Edit /u/drf3boys couldn't handle that i was missing a closing quotation mark [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odax7F3tWhM)



His screams make it so much better I like how that girl at the end just stands perfectly frozen after rushing to the scene... aliens confirmed. Who pressed pause on the girl on the right? "Trolling" "And that's when bill realized he had eaten the wrong gummies before heading to the mall." I wish I could get that immersed in VR stuff. I may have jumped at the initial push, but my brain would never let me believe I was in the game for more than half a second. I'm surprised nobody even mentions the fact that Mr. Flock of Seagulls time traveled right out of 1982 to push this guy. I forgive this repost as it is still hilarious to see how he freaks out The must've waxed the shit out of that floor. [Much better with sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odax7F3tWhM&t=1m26s) The girl entered the picture and froze like a glitch lmfao Pretty sure this is fake.  Buddy owns a vive.  One time when we were playing he accidentally flicked the mouse and my entire world started spinning.  All that happened was I felt super dizzy, lost my balance and dropped to one knee.  These seems like a total overreaction.  LSD and VR dont mix This reminds me of when people were first introduced to moving pictures. They leapt and screamed in the theatre when a filmed train came hurtling towards the screen. We think that's odd and now people 50 years from now will laugh at us. Is he related to the guy who fell for 9 seconds? http://i.imgur.com/gv2f6nH.gifv Anyone seeking more info might also check here:

 Who's trolling who here? Does anybody else think that his freak out has nothing to do with the VR, and everything to do with the fact that somebody just crept up and grappled him from behind while he is unable to see? I'd be freaking the fuck out too. I don't get why people don't just close their eyes. Like, the visual VR stops at that point and you just have sound. I've demoed all kinds of VR experiences to hundreds of people. Never seen anyone act like this.  This should be in r/Whatcouldgowrong black mirror, season 4  I think it was real judging by his face afterwards. The shame is strong. 

 Why isn't anyone commenting on that stylish hair? 

 If it wasn't for the VR I would have thought it's the late 80s.  I see some people are entirely made up of a reptilian cortex. I've got to wonder if people will laugh at us in 50 years because of clips like this the same way we laughed at the people who freaked out at the first silent film footage of the train steaming towards the camera.  This is like when people saw the first movie of a train coming towards them and everybody freaked out because they thought it was an actual train.  The newborn deer is strong with this one  Profitable repost.

This gif will never get old. Fck that, we're fighting! Everyone here whose calling him an idiot doesn't get how bad VR can fuck with your senses. I think he's faking it to be honest, but man VR can reaaaaally mess with your balance I like the girl who runs in at the end and appears to do nothing.  "Give me another headset!  I'll go inside the simulation and talk him down!"   Hahaha, he's experiencing severe psychological distress. Got 'im! well that was an assholish thing to do.  Guy must play for the NBA, trying to draw a foul like what 10/10 he probably bought it adter What is wrong with his fucking shoes? Love the ghetto vr setup He reminds me of a [robot] (http://giphy.com/gifs/child-12H6lGiU13qkTu) freaking [out] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b0/82/52/b08252457587840c968563f1d213ce78.gif).  Obligatory: https://youtu.be/x84GKqcpY4E this is a repost... I played a Vive over the weekend at a friends house and it was the first time I experienced VR ever. Now I cannot say if this was just him acting on this video but when I was playing a few games with heights, I was definitely nervous. I hate heights and I noticed the controllers slipping cause my hands were sweating. I did not want to walk close to the edge of cliffs and whatnot even though I knew it was not real. I believe some people may have different reactions to things in VR but from my one experience, I can tell you it felt more real than not. I feel like he's the one trolling them. The guy flailing makes me irrationally angry. Chill out! You know it's VR! At some point we have to question who the real troll is in this gif... You ~~can~~shouldn't do that with people on acid.

Upside is he will tell you the truth for a couple of hours.... I'll bee happy when these mall salesmen become liable for injuries. Pretty sure this is faked. Guy knows he is in a video game. I bet he freaks out this much at the IMAX too. I'm disappointed to see that the TV stood intact. Did these geniuses ever think of adding a CHAIR to the demo area? Hire me.  This does not work in reverse, fyi.

Rip, Eric Prank != troll. This isn't trolling. When you fall down in the Matrix, you fall down in real life.
 Lasted about 0.04 seconds. I love how the lady at the end sort of just glitches up and freezes. That guy must have died at least 5 times! I wonder if he wasn't the one trolling them If there's any trolling go on here it's the dude with the VR headset. Lol, this can't be real.  It's like he started having a seizure or something.  wow. what an overdramatic retard. fake and gay Remember, if you die in the game, you die for real. This could have looked real if he didn't freak out for so long.  [This is infinitely better with sound.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3V8zeSljUU&ab_channel=TrueTubeMediaTV) The screams; the screams. And that goofy-ass laugh. Also, only in Russia. You can skip to 1:20. Guys you need to watch this WITH audio... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3V8zeSljUU&feature=youtu.be&t=85 How does this even happen? Like I totally get his initial flipout being shoved with the headset on I can easily see him panicking for a few seconds. This however was a legit 20 second of continuous leg kicking panic how do you get to that point with some goggles and headphones?  Am I the only person who sees shit like this and thinks VR is a really stupid idea? Dude is faking. There is no way that would keep going on that long. I remember hearing a story about when movies first became a thing, there was a video of a train coming into station and everybody in the room freaked out because they thought they were about to be run over. We find that hilarious, but this is way more embarrassing. Holy crap that poor guy?! They really need all wireless setup for this...lol "trolling"  Did that at a Uni open day. On the drops i'd always get them to look up lift their hands in the air then look right down as it drops. One time I did that and this girl just started full on screaming! Was hillarious I had Oculus on my head and played War Thunder. First of all I have been sold to VR since. Secondly my piloting skills were mulitiplied by the simple ability to look around.   I did try trackIr and it just cannot compare. VR is thousand times better. The perspective view does a lot. Great expeirence. 

But being in that situation in the clip? The immersion is so much I would not dare enough to stand through 're rollercaster. And if somebody would put me out of balance? Lot of messy cleaning... Are the floors waxed that good? WTF is wrong with that guy? Just close your eyes you fucking idiot I think they would damage fewer expensive VR headsets if they gave people a chair... "Unplug it!"  
"Don't! If you do it now, he'll be stuck on that roller coaster for the rest of his life!" "Not like this. Not like this." It's hilarious, but something about VR makes people forget that they can turn it off by just taking off the goggles or even simply closing your eyes. I tossed my little sister in a Vive zombie shooting game that was on the creepier side.  At one point, a zombie pops up behind her and she falls to the ground screaming at the top of her lungs.  My sister is a stoic bad ass.  I have never heard her scream continuously like that.  To her credit, she continued to shoot back, while on the floor, pleading for me to turn it off.  My otherwise cool as ice soon to be PhD sister forgot she could take the head set off in the moment.

If the Vive has taught me one thing, it is that we humans are **REALLY** visual creatures.  If what you see matches up kinda-sorta with reality, your brain just nods and accept what it is seeing as its new reality.  The fact that you move around one to one in games and the hand controls kind of sort of work like hands is more than enough to get you to mostly buy it.  I mean, you *know* it is obviously not even a little real looking, but your automatic responses kinda-sorta think that maybe it what you are seeing *is* real.  If you get scared and your higher reasoning shuts down further as you get more primal, you start acting like you think what you are seeing is more and more real. It's really funny how people don't even just close their eyes, but I demo a lot and this is common. Is there some reason they left them on for so long? VR is the Matrix now? My mind went straight to SAO. [:)](http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f199c960fe0c1fe7e914d3cf69e55ff7.jpg) Did you hear the story about the girl who was sexually assaulted in a VR game?

[Seriously.](http://wtvr.com/2016/10/29/jordan-belamire-sexually-assaulted-virtual-reality-htc-vive-vr-quivr/) The body cannot exist without the mind  Not like this...not like this. *slips on polished tile floor, dies* GAME OVER You failed as Roy, you should have went back to the carpet store. Job simulator. What kind of life do you lead?

Edit: damn, apparently I need to quit my job and instead play job simulator  I experienced severe vertigo while playing Batman: Arkham Asylum on PSVR. The scene opened up with my standing on top of a pillar of some kind. Lean on your own time I was playing the Budget Cuts demo yesterday (super cool, i recommend trying it actually), and I (attempted to) put my knee against a table to push it out of the way in the game, before I realized it wasn't real, haha. 

Honestly a super cool experience. Did you have to relearn how to walk? I had someone fall face first in job sim reaching across the counter in the restaurant to grab a customer's pipe.  The also tried to balance on the counter. I was playing New Retro Arcade standing up with a joystick. When I wanted to go to another machine I instinctively let go of the joystick, it happens. Is there a non VR version? There is a line between want and need. I just crossed the need line.  Don't try to hold onto the counter to balance, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth: there is no counter. You know you could be getting paid to play the game IRL right? I was playing a VR tour of the human body last night, and near the end there was a virus attack and I nearly fell over trying  to avoid one coming at my head. Like trying to dodge a baseball.       
           
The worst part though is when the narrator was like 'this cell probably won't survive...alright moving on!' I was like, "C'mon man, we can't just sit here and do *nothing*! We gotta save this cell man...or at least watch the viruses co-op the cells protein factories and rupture to release more viruses. Yeah maybe a polished waxed floor is a pretty stupid environment to showcase VR?

Hahaha Probably worried about him dragging the whole setup down with him.  [deleted] Every time I see something like this I wonder why don't they just close their eyes? Every time i see this i wonder why they oversold it so much and thought people would actually believe its not staged. Probably because it's fake and nobody would want to see a video of a guy just sitting there on the floor, taking off the VR right away, and turning around to say 'that wasn't very nice.' They say that he's still falling. "....dude, close your eyes or something. fuck." I would so exaggerate my reaction too, spinning on the ground doing somersaults and flips and shit This mf'er is a about to get me arrested! I showed my mom Project:Cars. She wore the Rift while I drove. She was frantically reaching for the brakes, screaming, and bracing for death at every turn, reaching out to grab the handle above the door.

My brother and I nearly died laughing. Neither of us reacted anything close to like that, but people who don't intuitively understand the tech and who don't game frequently might.  All these insane reactions always seem so fake. Owning a Vive myself, I wasn't even close to feeling any of those supposed reactions, not even close.  Hes literally sat on the floor at one point but still tries to flap and stand up for some reason. I can't imagine this being authentic  I own a Vive. It is very possible that this is real, especially on that slick floor. VR is usually nothing like that, until an outside force surprises you. I tripped over a box once and had a similar, though less extreme, reaction. It could be real. A lot of people are very easy to fool/scare. 

On the Oculus subreddit, someone posted a video of his african great aunt trying VR for the first time and she freaked out on the oculus home screen.

When I demo my Oculus to people in the 50s, they all flinched and docked on the T-rex demo.  Pretty high actually.  How many people do these demos?  I'd imagine tens of thousands by now.  How many of these videos have you seen? I've only seen about 4.  Out of tens of thousands of demos I'm sure a few people are going to react like this, simply because people are so different and likely to react to stimulus in different ways.  If you'd like to speculate further about it's authenticity find out who posted it.  If a youtube star posted himself reacting like this I'd instantly call bullshit.  If some random guy posted it I'd be more likely to believe it.  Also where it happened could be a clue.  If the same place was constantly putting out videos of this happening it would obviously be bullshit.  This investigation could go way deeper. 12 He could be really high
  Not very I've been in some intense VR simulations and can completely relate with the first few seconds.  But after that its just too much and makes me think fake. Zero.  ["I'm coming up with 32.33 (repeating of course) percentage"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hooKVstzbz0&feature=youtu.be&t=74) Oh god no > I just think of all those kids who will be pleasuring themselves

Uhhhhh.. >I just think of all those kids who will be pleasuring themselves...

Why don't you come have a seat over here? Basically [this CollegeHumor video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I60BhhL9H30&app=desktop). I live alone but I still lock my bedroom door when I fap to VR Might actually be less awkward. Gives the mom a chance to leave without confrontation unlike the current state of things.  "OH GOD my entire life was a dream and I woke up on a roller coaster!" I have this talk with friends when I put them in VR for the first time.  "It is easy to forget for a moment that it is a game because it was engineered to fool you.  If you EVER freak out or can't handle something, just close your eyes, put up your hands, and say I'm done."  I alt+f4 the game, and no one breaks my shit.  I have had a lot of dumb shit happen though with people that just fucking forget it is game.  Well, they know they are playing a game, but all the autopilot stuff our brain does seems to forget. Lmfao that guys laugh reminds me of krusty the clown [I'll save you a minute 20](https://youtu.be/Odax7F3tWhM?t=84) Anyone have the gif of the guy with the shovel falling for 2 mins in the snow? Hahah what the hell. His scream and the guy laughing makes the perfect combination ##AA BLYET OAAHHH BLYAT OAHHH BLYAT!

How very Russian. Finally all that Russian I have been learning through csgo is useful.  Instead of trying to hold him, why not just take the headset off. I feel like she tried to turn off the console She is a sim Looks like she's making sure the screen doesn't fall while trying to stay out of the way.  The simulation was paused because of the error in the simulation in the simulation. I wondered where the trolling was.

This is a practical joke at best. there was a time when i thought trolling meant disrupting a discussion online by being mischievous, for one's own amusement.
now it's used to mean "being mean on the internet"....or in this case...i don't even know.
 That word has lost all meaning. It frustrates me every time I see it used so casually when it has a very precise meaning. All of the modern meanings are so far from its original meaning that just seeing the word makes me tune out.

Trolling had a very specific purpose to weed out the September newbies from the regulars. It had to be done periodically on a newsgroup to maintain a proper signal-to-noise ratio. It was good for the ecosystem. As such, there was no such thing as "a troll". Trolling did not have a negative connotation because it was a necessary part of the ecosystem to keep the newbies from overwhelming the discussion with garbage. 

It was an initiation and induction into the internet for a newbie. Posts were intentionally written to distract newbies and waste their time so that they would not clog up the newsfroup with their meaningless drivel.

Probably the most famous example of trolling in the old sense of the word "trolling for newbies" is the green golf ball joke on rec.humor.

Of course, those of you who have already been initiated need no further explanation. Unfortunately, with search engines available to everyone, the true job of trolling becomes much much more difficult. It's much harder to distract even a newbie with misinformation now that search engines substitute for institutional knowledge.
 There are people who have a firm grasp on spacial awareness and then there are people who are like the guy in the video. It's not as much about believing as it is about trying to stabilize yourself after the initial scare. Wow, good thing you forgave him. Hear that OP?! Today is your lucky day!! This is so hilarious! Man, he was swallowed. Slicker coating than OP's mom's ass. I could understand the initial freak out and attempt to rock back to regain balance (even over correctling to such a degree that he needed to be caught), but then it went on for another 15 seconds. I spent the whole gif thinking "dude, just close your eyes"  Well i think that he would have done the same thing but the dude instead grabbed him. Made him off balance and he couldnt get traction so it felt like he was still about to fall and panicked. If he closes his eyes he won't know which direction to lean/fall. Did you give them a good shove just as they went over the top of a rollercoaster? I hate games with just a regular 2D setup and falling from heights.

Assasin's Creed was fun. Wow I bet the poor guy needed therapy after this happened Very. When I tried VR at college (both the Vive and Rift) we were explicitly told not to fuck around with whoever was playing at the time, both by our tutors and the headsets themselves. It's easy to say 'just close your eyes lol' but the entire point of VR is to trick your brain, and if some dickhead decides to throw you around then you're going to have a bad time. They're attached to an idiot.  Called 'Mom'. I think thats probably likely  I want to get off Mr Bones Wild Ride. Spy kids 3-D: Game Over? ....Mr. Bone's Wild Ride????? I think of this scene every time I hear or see the twitch emote Seriously if you look at that angle when she delivers that line, she looks exactly like Reeves. Hahhahahahahhaba!!!! Your comment es muy bueno. I want to experience that primal terror just for the sake of being wrong in my thinking along the lines of "pft, as an avid gamer that would never happen to me" 
 Not exactly: the Matrix is a VR. no its SAO 1, 2 VR is coming for you. 3, 4 better clear the floor. 5, 6 get your controller sticks. 7, 8 gonna stay up late. 9, 10 never sleep again.  And didn't come back. Until we see the full drive system VR will remain a disappointment to me. Mine went to .//hack I really squanched the opportunity for a joke there It's ridiculously entertaining. "Gourmet Chef" is the best. I served a rude customer "Lemon, Cork, & Glass Shard Soup".

I am definitely a manchild. [Oh dude, you have no idea how good it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJj1Q8kBGog) This dude went back to work at the carpet shop.  [Maybe he is German?](http://i.imgur.com/HfdyDFO.jpg) The exact opposite of everyone. He's an eccentric billionaire who just wants a regular 9 to 5. The leader of my clan in one game has around one thousand hours logged in Train Simulator. 

In real life,  he's a truck driver. 

Gaming preferences are weird Jesus, no doubt. That one was the first one I did. Even the stupid "pong" game in the demo games is dizzying to look down. 

The street luge one made my head hurt. My brain was like "You're moving reaaally fast- but you're not. Buuuuuuut you also definitely are." Time to lean, time to clean. Slightly? After an hour in the headset it's really disorienting to be a person again. I also do that, but occasionally I enjoy recreation  I think him slipping on the floor just as the roller coaster went over was the thing that really sold it for his sense of balance going completely crazy. Imagine how much money they'll make on VR safety mats.  Why doesn't spazzy mcgee just close his fuckin eyes? Panic attack over.  I feel like this is something to consider beforehand. Just sit him down on the ground. You can see there's plenty of cord length. Yea, the vive has an extra "breakout box" to put all the connectors in, so if you trip with the headset on it won't rip the hdmi ports out of your graphics card.

This is an old gif, I guarantee they don't have a breakout box like that. It's one of those new headsets that beams the footage right into your brain regardless if your eyes are open. It's almost impossible to ignore reflex, and reflex says to keep your eyes open if you think you're dying.  in the moment you dont think about it  I did the Oculus demo and there is a scene where you stand at the edge of a tall building looking down into the street. For about two seconds I really believed that if I took another step I will fall and die. It's incredibly real. Its just as likely not staged. Sight is our primary guiding sense, weve never practiced it being "wrong". Anyways theyre currently having smalls troubles with peoples perception. Doing a simple test in VR swapping from first person to third causes 9/10 people to lose their balance and fall. So yea he might really have gotten confused by having his sight tell him one thing and suddenly even his body agrees (inner ear notices balance being awry and falling forward) eliciting a panic response.  I work in VR. I've made hundreds of people try the Rift and the Vive, and I can tell you that this is not staged AT ALL. Yeah... I don't know. Here's a bunch more [reactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INDKNA7kXoo) playing that same game... and lots of them were recorded with potatoes. I was skeptical at first, but if this isn't genuine, they modeled it after other people having the same type of reactions. I flinch and duck while playing FPS games. It's embarrassing but that's the way my reflexes work. If you put me in a VR situation, I would probably react the same way.

EDIT: BTW, does anyone else have the flinching and ducking problem when playing FPS? [some more that aren't fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INDKNA7kXoo). Lots of people falling with that rollercoaster game lol Eh, I've seen people freak the fuck out with the headsets on. One dude at PAX I saw just turned and started running in terror until it yanked the cord and he realized what he was doing. I've also seen people literally giggling in glee as they play games like they're in a fantasy realm.

People do funny things when they get really immersed. r/nothingeverhappens Yeah that guy was overreacting big time. Guess he pranked them back with his annoying fish out of water reaction?  That's actually the time to fake a seizure.  It's why I always carry a couple of alka-seltzer with me, pop half of one in your mouth and you're foaming at the mouth, add completely shaking and spazing out on the ground and you get a crowd. 

Then, just before the ambulance arrives, stand up and walk away as if nothing happened.  It's amazing how many people will try to get you to sit down after a move like that.  Help me baby Jesus! Help me Tom Cruise I thought all the YouTube reaction videos was all fake but it's totally real, even though you keep telling yourself it's just a game with people all around you talking about. Played that Vive zombie shooter, and even though I've played years of Nazi zombies, I was scared shitless. It was getting harder and harder to shoot because my hands were literally trembling from fear. It's not my first rodeo with shooters either, was playing Doom (yes the original) back when I was in 3rd grade elementary and been a fps addict ever since.

Oh yes, VR is the real deal. My roommate bought a Vive. I bought him Fancy Skiing after a few stories in the Vive sub. I get setup and take off down the hill. Before long, it feels like I'm going about 80 mph down the hill. I've skied all my life, and am no stranger to speed. This, however, was way too fast. As it turns out, it wasn't a hill I was on, but one side of a v-shaped ravine. As I approached the bottom, I started to panic. I physically know what hitting a compression like that feels like when skiing. My brain did the math based on my "speed," and freaked out. Whhen I hit the bottom of the ravine in the game, my legs buckled from under me, and now I was laying backwards on my skis, shooting up the other side at unnatural speeds. When I got to the top I was sent plunging off a cliff on the other side. The goggles came off immediately. I didn't feel right for about a half hour after that. 

All in all, it was a hilarious, fucked up experience. I don't have any problem believing that this was an authentic reaction from this guy. It's difficult enough in my head to reconcile the movement that my eyes are telling my brain is happening with the lack of movememt the rest of my body is telling my brain. Getting shoved in the middle of the experience? Jesus Christ, I'd probably shit my pants. Then for revenge, I'd shit their pants. Good advertisement  A friend of mine has one that I've been playing with for a while now, and honestly it seems like the biggest reactions are from people that just don't have that much spatial awareness or are playing in environments that don't have a well-curated space for the VR. It can certainly get pretty disorienting since you're locked in visually to whatever you're playing and lose all normal visual references, and that only gets worse when you're watching something like a rollercoaster where your physical orientation is COMPLETELY different from your digital orientation. Toss in some dick pushing you while you're doing it, and I figure many people could pretty authentically have their sense of balance ruined in this way.

However, I wouldn't say it's an example of *good* immersion. It's immersion in the sense that two of your senses are completely usurped, and yes that can lead to awkward fumbling in reality, but for most of what I've played, interaction is so strange since there is zero feedback of any kind and what you see gets decoupled from how you're trying to control yourself pretty easily, leading to a lot of effort spent trying to fight the controls rather than them ever feeling like an extension of you. It feels so unnatural and difficult to actually play the games relative to standard controller or mouse-and-keyboard that it's very hard to ever feel as immersed in the game's reality. owning a vive, me neither. but i've seen plenty of similar reactions from people i've demoed it to. When my uncle tried the Samsung Gear for the first time, we had him sit through a horror themed ride. He was screaming so loud we thought we would get kicked out of the hotel room we were in. When people don't expect it to be so real, they freak out. Yea but she pushed him right as the anticipation for the drop was building and it kinda looks like he passed out for a bit there then woke up disoriented and still "on" a virtual roller coaster, I would probably shit myself I've bailed a few times playing Windlands, But nothing like that. This could very well be fake, but have you ever gone though this demo with a VR device?  It's extremely disorienting. Did anyone push you while going downhill in a rollercoaster? I definitely have reactions like this. I find it super easy to suspend my disbelief and I think that makes me susceptible to reactions like this. I did a VR horror story once and it was the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced. I think if I subjected myself to a full length VR horror movie I'd end up with major PTSD. I have an oculus and have shown at least 15 people. 2 of them reacted like this to a couple of stuff. Funniest shit in the world to see in person. I just got a PSVR, and the closest I came was when my arms started going wonky on screen tracking the ps move controllers, so I raised them in the air to show how stupid it would look on screen and stuck them right into the ceiling fan... I'd blame the "helpful" person who keeps trying to pull him up. Once he/she (I really can't tell) finally lets him sit down, he is fine and can take the headset off. its vertigo, the floor probably felt like it was a wall. once your inner ear is in motion its pretty hard for it to find equilibrium that makes sense when your eyes are seeing different things. the friendly push was just enough to lose his refrence point, just as it went over the hump.

he is somewhere between the drunk spins, and waking up as some one tips your chair. Yeah it's the slick floor. That's what was sending his brain into panic mode. They should have just left him alone, but the problem is their real concern is he'll break their goggles/setup. So they have to try to keep him still. WhyTF they didn't have like a carpet down or something is beyond me.  Not only that, but the DK1 Rift does not have positional tracking - so his point of view never leaves the ride even with all the flopping, probably adding to the sense of presence.

It could easily be fake, but given the list of conditions (having someone stand while doing a roller coaster demo, etc) there is no telling how unprepared this guy was for VR Stoned people are going to make some really funny VR videos. Probably. You know it's going to happen. Jesus christ. I know. Please stop, it's hard to sneak back out  [relevant](http://i.imgur.com/PoQmNax.gifv)  [Laughs in Russian] His laugh made me laugh to tears.  The laugh is what makes this video, posting it in gif form is fucking stupid, you just get a bunch of pricks complaining that it's fake. It's a classic over at /r/contagiouslaughter *add plays before video http://i.imgur.com/gv2f6nH.gifv Blyat* Pretty sure she was moving up to try and catch if the TV or console started to fall off Even the noun "troll" is misused as the noun for the author. But the noun refers to the effect of the post and not even the post itself. The "troll" is the effect of removing a potentially non-contributing member of the group from participating. It is the early internet's version of voter suppression, in a way.

You might comment after the intended effect had taken course: "Nice troll!"

But it was never done maliciously nor even necessarily for the amusement of the author.

In fact, what infuriates me is that the modern meaning of troll has the opposite effect of the original, now archaic meaning. To troll meant to weed out, such as trolling your swimming pool for leaves and bugs with a net is a type of cleaning the pool.

But the modern usage of troll is exactly the kind of garbage, what we now call shitposts, that the original trolling was meant to prevent in the firstplace.

In a way, /r/The_Donald is perhaps a type of troll in the archaic sense of the word if it was done in order to keep the rest of the population of reddit free from the people who would inhabit such a place so earnestly. Unfortunately, the people who are earnest about /r/The_Donald far outnumber the people who seem to be trolling. And besides that, it is difficult to distinguish between the trollers and the ones being trolled.

In ancient internet days, there were few enough people in the entire internet that you could easily recognize regulars and thus would know that they were trolling. You wouldn't have the confusion that you have on /r/The_Donald distinguishing between people who were earnest and people who were trolling. Thus, the archaic meaning and its practice have absolutely no use anymore in modern internet. And it's a shame. The signal to noise ratio of Reddit is pretty bad.

But content moderators can only do so much. I much preferred the old days when people without much real information to contribute could easily be weeded out (aka trolled) and removed from throwing their noise into the discussion.

But alas, the art of trolling for real has been lost along with its original meaning. And thus, a very important tool of an internet community maintaining its ecosystem balance has been lost. And basically, all modern internet communities slowly devolve into awful communities as a result. Reddit is no exception. This is especially true because modern trolling is not frowned upon nor weeded out of the ecosystem by true classic trolls. Thus, without this social pressure and shame established from the top of the social value pyramid, newbies are free to shitpost and troll (in the modern sense of the word) while the people who could set an example do the same, thus setting a bad example for all future community members.

 People like this guy make sure hypnotists have jobs.  I haven't used real VR but I have used Gear VR and while it was very immersive and I did feel like I was at the beach or whatever I was looking at, I could tell when i was about to fall out of my chair.  Umm...wording. My understanding was, although I do think it's fake or exaggerated, the fact that the workers didn't let the dude just fall to the floor didn't help things. Falling to the floor helps to reset your equilibrium, and if some fuckwit is trying to hold you up while you're panicking and trying to find your balance, I could see it leading to situations like this.  https://i.imgur.com/W1zk4ZF.jpg Thats not how it works, reflex keeps your eyes open. What?

Your sense of balance doesn't come from your eyes. They help you, but balance is sensed through the liquid in your ears I could image. I could see myself being mind fucked super easily by that. Some people are just dicks.  Damnit you made me laugh out loud in public like a damn fool. Take your upvote. https://m.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/rhs54/one_does_not_simply_get_off_of_mr_bones_wild_ride/
 Who doesn't amirite? God damn, if the app could gold I would. This made my night. All matrix are VR, but not all VR are matrix. Yeah I dont think they got /u/byyhmz 's reference. Oh well. Too soon.  I feel like you might be there a while. That's okay. You'll squanch it next time. I SQUANCH MY FAMILY. This had me in tears. I would freaking love this game. I used to play a demo disk of a game called hospital "something" on PS1 and I loved it! My favorite part was seeing the Achievement Hunter guys in their video make Soup, soup, and soup flavored soup. You've just sold it to me. Did I just spend fifteen minutes watching a video of someone playing a game where they are pretending to be working

What is going on with my life "AAH!...i can Eat DONUTS!"

*copies donut in machine*..."aaaAaAAaAAEEEII!!"

That whole thing is gold. oh boy.  

i remember nerdcubed. Everything was fine until I started to get nauseated.  Ugh.  =( "That was very, business." [another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAMpL5I_mJc) I just watched that whole thing. So funny.  Reminds me of Homer Simpson. I love that he just keeps grabbing the boss' glasses off his face.  Gotta take Roy off the grid I played Job Simulator at work (we did VR research), and going back to real work after felt very surreal.
 he's still playing a game called recession  [deleted] That's one of those simple solutions that only come to you when you're thinking clearly.

Not so much when you're freaking out in public. Evolution.  If you are in a fight-or-flight response, your brain doesn't let you just "close your eyes". Why didnt the guy just set him down? Haha thats the first comment i have read in a while on reddit that actually stopped me from continuing to breath through my nose mcweeeeee Jim Carey's The Riddler would be proud.  [or like this ](https://media1.giphy.com/media/uVOTxMagGsgXS/giphy.gif)  Sword art online irl http://m.imgur.com/gallery/Tkx7d Yup, people usually try to look away in VR or shield themselves with their hands rather than ~~look away.~~ close their eyes. Similar with the drowning reflex.

If someone's in water and they're waving their arms, they're panicking.

If someone's in water and they're pushing down onto the water to lift their head up, they're drowning. So, did you take another step or did you leap?  Yeah I've got a fear of height and this scenario was pretty scary. I did lean over the ledge a bit though just to look down. Reminds me of Gotham  >For about two seconds

Here is the key part. The guy in this video flails around for like half a minute and continues to do so after his headphones come off.   Sure, flipping out initially is reasonable. But for that long? He didn't at any point realize that he wasn't actually falling? They weren't saying anything to him like, "Dude it's just a joke"? It just all goes on for too long I've played Minecraft on my vive. When you are standing on a tall tower, and look down, it feels like you will fall. Even though logically I knew I was on my apartment floor, I felt like if I took a step I would fall to my death. Vr can def feel real. One day, this comment will be in an old video about ancient VR And people of the future will laugh at you so hard. I've done the "Shark Encounter" in PSVR Worlds twice, and even knew exactly what to expect the first time... still flinched both times, and probably would a third time.  It's very hard to overcome your most basic instincts to avoid something large, fast, and dangerous.  It's more of a brain stem reaction than a conscious choice to flinch.

I'm typically the guy who hates horror cause it's so cliche, and rolls my eyes instead of getting scared in scary games, but the power of VR to communicate scale and presence is really terrifying.  I find that the scariest stuff is the believable stuff, like the Shark Encounter, not the goofy horror stuff like RE7, Until Dawn, etc.  My mind does not get tricked as much when the "scary stuff" is impossible monsters. When I was a kid I used to walk around the house holding a mirror right below my eyes, so that it looked like the ceiling was the floor. It created the same feeling, that every step I took would result in a fall. I did a Vive demo where you are underwater on a ship wreck.  During part of the demo a whale swims up to the ship wreck to check you out and it later swims away.  I knew I was in a VR demo, but when the the whale swam away and its tail came, what I perceived to be perilously close, I instinctively stepped back and ducked.

Between the VR headset and the noise-cancelling surround sound headphones, it really does trick your senses. r/nothingeverhappens the thing is none of these people play video games and have no concept of being in a "fake" 3d world.  Its probably their first experience with being in a virtual 3d space of any kind. I'm not saying it was me. But the first time I used my vive someone was definitely squeeling in excitement. In my apartment. When I was alone. My wife informed me that I make weird sounds when I watch TV shows with headphones on and can't hear myself. those things need a quick release cable for such occasions [deleted] Well yeah, according to my first aid trainer walking away trying to pretend like nothing happened is a very common behavior after experiencing a seizure in public. I guess if you're used to having them and are feeling embarrassed about it, it makes sense. I can play any horror game on my PC, no problem. I'd never actually felt fear from a "horror experience" like haunted houses or horror movies...I got the Vive, and couldn't get past wave 2 on the Brookhaven demo. I was SHAKING. That feeling that one of those monsters will come up behind you was ridiculous. I forgot it was just a game for a moment. As they got closer I would literally yell and look away while emptying the mag. The anxiety had my knees buckling. I had to take off my headset. The full game has been on my wish list for months, but I just can't do it.

Same with Raw Data. Those undead robots attacking you in level 2... haven't played passed that level either. VR has ruined me. I've spent probably hundreds of hours in VR, and I'm making a game. As you do, I play test it a lot so its become pretty comfortable.

There's an encounter in it involving a giant tarantula that gives me a lizard brain reaction without fail, every time. >  I'd shit their pants.

damn I fell on my ass about 30 seconds after putting on some demo headset at an ATT store. A character on the screen moved towards me kind of quickly and my brain flipped out. I'm incredibly susceptible to suggestion and I have no doubt that I'd be *at least* as as ridiculous as the guy in the video.  I demoed an oculus experience where a T Rex approached and then charged toward me in a museum. I god damn near fell to my knees in terror. On the one hand you could say I'm a pussy. On the other - I'm really gonna get my money's worth from VR.  That ended well. Stop trying to sell me VR! Im not ready yet sir! Not everyone who owns a VR headset decides to preach it like it's the future of gaming.

For those of us who haven't tried it, I think one thing is very very clear: Your mileage may vary, depending on you and your own body if nothing else. And you can't upgrade your body's hardware. Yet. If anything, this is less appealing to me than a game that doesn't cause you to do this stupid shit. People who more frequently play video games are better at visiospacial cognition so it makes sense that if you put someone who's not really a gamer in this artificial place their brain would be having a hard enough time managing the one reality to simultaneously remember the second real world reality.  I don't own a vive, tried my friend's tho.  I'm one of those people. this got shared like a year ago too. I seem to remember this was from Russia and the dude was drunk. Just close your eyes man. No, it goes on too long. It's fake.  It's pretty easy to know if you are on a floor. You know, gravity and everything. I have an Oculus and while its immersive, it doesn't cut you off so much that you have no idea where up and down are and if you are SITTING on the ground, it's pretty freaking obvious. Or he'll break his neck and sue My arms work perfectly well, sir/madam! Locking doors will become acceptable /r/retiredgif >In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat.

C'mon, there are children here. Eww... It's so good. Throwing things around like the Swedish Chef and then hurtling my fuckups into the nearby fish tank had me in pain from laughter more than once. Theme hospital Theme Hospital? Dont know if thats it and I dont know if it was on console, but thats what jumped into my mind.

Homer? I stopped watching for a little while. But then he started doing VR stuff and it's hilarious. He incorporates physical comedy into let's-plays, something that could never be done before and I'm pretty sure he's the only one doing it.  [Direct link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3V8zeSljUU) on Youtube That scream!! xD > when you're freaking out in public.

Or on a rollercoaster that just went out of control. Same thing when my headphones are on full blast. I rush to get my phone and lower the volume instead of just taking the headphones off. Ive never been this immersed in vr its always sitting in the back of my mind that this is fake hell i can ignore my biggest fear (heights) and have a good time knowing its fake Exactly. It feels like it's actually happening and closing your eyes wouldn't help in that situation if it were.   that's horrifying If you die in the game you die for real!  Well, that fries your brain on removal. Halfway there, though. *rather than close their eyes (you mean) *Underwater Safeword* shall be my if-I-wanted-a-band-name of the day. Pulled the gun out of my pocket right there in the mall and shot myself. I'd rather get shot than fall... fear of heights. I took a step back lol. Didn't have the guts. My mind knew it was fake, but the feel was real. he probably freed his mind and made the jump across.
 Granted.. he's got like 3 people wrangling him. First one has him in a half nelson, while attacker number two is going for the arm bar. depends, the rush of adrenaline may have also caused him to start a panic attack.

Not everyone reacts the same way to an event like that. Shit man I did the same thing haha. Glad I'm not the only one. I told my girlfriend about this and she looked at me like I was crazy. My life sucks so everyone's life sucks is a pretty common belief on reddit ikr? When I played the Star Trek Bridge Crew demo at PAX, I was pretty gleeful.  I could not stop smiling.  I still think about that 15 minute demo months later.  Based on that experience alone I was ready to lay down $$$ for a VR Headset. brownie in the pants and then you can "----" your pants I carry a small knife but that's only for when the Bodachs are chasing me.  Tried Raw Data on my friend's Vive... I may have ended up punching the ceiling fan while trying to attack a drone that was flying over me... I'm usually very good about being aware of my surroundings, but man, I got sucked in hard.  I didn't have any issue with horror type stuff in VR. There is a line that puts me solidly on the sane side of the uncanny Valley with stuff like that. I found the more regular stuff more disconcerting.  Revenge is a dish best served hot and steaming, with chunks of undigested corn in it. The intensity of the experience really can't be overstated. Some good tactile VR shit will fuck your shit up. My roomate got Richie's Plank Experience. I hear it's like a thousand times scarier if you use a real plank. I'm going to get one and try it one of these days.  Soon, Shadowrun. Soon. Some people aren't able to get into it. For example, haunted houses don't phase me. I can't seem to let my mind believe that it is real. The same sort of thing happened to 2 of my friends this weekend when we tried PlayStation VR. They thought it was cool but they didn't seem impressed. 

But when I tried it it was different. For some reason my brain thought it was real. It was obviously a video game and the people were rendered as good as a PS4 can render them (obviously fake still). But when I looked around the room I was in, it felt real. I could see the depth. Recalling playing the game is no different than my memory of sitting in my room last night before I went to bed. 

I think it is different for everyone and depends greatly on if you're able to let yourself experience it as "reality." > And you can't upgrade your body's hardware. Yet.

After watching Black Mirror, when we do have that technology, I will be having none of it. I don't own a VR headset and I think it's pretty obvious that this is going to be a big part of the future of gaming. Yeah man, 3D models will never catch on.  SNES Pixel Art forever.

You know you can sit down to play a ton of VR games, right? 2077 is just around the corner. It's definenetly a unique experience for sure but it's really not that hard to just close your eyes in a situation like that.

The guy is either faking or is incredibly uncoordinated. I can't wait for Ghost in the Shell prosthetic bodies. I dunno my dad who is in his late 60's got to try my oculus this past weekend. Now I have a PC gamer dad who was the one with the gaming addiction that I sat and watched /played alongside growing up. 

He's really stepped back in the past decade or so and is like a 3000+ hours on Civ V and Landmark kind of gamer now but he's seen pretty much everything.

One thing I didn't know was he had a huge fear of heights, so when he was running the oculus demo real and got to the building scaffolding his legs started shaking and he almost fell over from the reaction.

I'd say this is pretty plausible for some people, a shove in the back at just the right time can disorient people a lot looking down at heights. 

Also this video is a few years old and is funnier with sound.  Exactly, it's like watching your sister play NES for the first time in 1985 and she swings her arms holding the remote while trying to jump mario instead of sitting still and just pressing the button.   Thats why Rick can talk while playing Roy [relevant](http://i.imgur.com/39i2Pkw.jpg) They grab him mid-confusion. Repeatedly and fairly sporadically. I don't think that helped. That's what I'm thinking. A quick reflex reaction, fine - but how fucking stupid would you have to be to continue panicking for 20 seconds, without once remembering that you were in a VR game and you can just relax and take off the headset? Or he'll break his neck and *not* sue :-/ Every. Damn. Thread.  Holy shit yes.  It's not on a coaster though. Checkmate Six Flags.

Also, /r/rollercoasters /r/shestillsucking/ Huh, I must be an actor then. I was hypnotized a few years ago and have been told by family that I did things I cannot remember. Where do I pick up my actor paychecks

 They all have to squanch up one day. I never tried to play it that way.  Be right back. Elvis has left the building!  That game was great! Yes!! People with inflated heads? Dudes looking like Elvis? People suffering from invisibility?
Yeah Theme Hospital.  Hell yes! This game was amazing.  I'm at work, pretending to work, reading about a guy at work pretending to work, who is watching a guy pretending to work [one more?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAMpL5I_mJc) That laugh!

Gaaooouuuhhhaaa hahahaha 

Gaaooouuuhhhaaa hahahaha  "HHUGHUUHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHGHHHHHH!!!" Or especially when you're doing both simultaneously. I do the exact opposite I fling those thing off as fast as I can.  I do this  but because I'm concerned about damaging the headphones if the volume is too loud. Perhap I don't be more concerned about my ears...  This is the Internet, a place where the normal rules of survival don't apply and where people have full control over every primitive sense in their body.  It's not every day you see someone reference A Clockwork Orange on reddit. WHAT Thanks :) Corrected. Very sensible of you I was working in a psych lab at th university I went to and we were designing an experiment where we judged people's emotional state after exposure to multiple heights via the oculus rift. Well, we had a platform for people to stand on so that there was an actual ledge under their feet. It is so much more realistic and terrifying with that ledge there that you can actually feel. I can't wait for VR porn For all he knows his friends are bleeding out on the floor and he's about to be gang banged. It's ok, you can say poop here. Or shit. Or smurf. Anything, really. Revenge is a dish best served in shitty pants I thought you were joking but there is actually a 'Richie's Plank Experience'.  I think I'd rather play 'Richie's Wife Experience.'  (I suffer from extreme vertigo and have heard his wife is freaky) Careful of your essence tho Dragon President's gonna fix everything. No wifi though. Needs a datajack to see those kitten pics. You wouldn't wanna mess up your huge pink mohawk with one of these primitive headsets anyway Goggles' so 2050 though.. Who needs a pair of goggle when you can hotsim.

I mean, no need to upgrade yourself, technology takes care of that for you. If shadow run universe breaks into ours, you know that cyberware is dumb and expensive. Gimme my mystic adept powers and let me run around murdering people with my chi powered dick. Careful chummer, getting dumped can frag you faster than a chromed out tusker after you pissed in his soykaf.  Skillsofts are broken as shit Nice reference, chummer. I've demoed a lot and noticed this variance early on.  The community commonly refers to it as immersion.  Here are some things that help  people subconsciously forget it isn't real:

* HMD positioning - Many people think it is supposed to be a little blurry or don't really want to admit they are going a little cross eyed.  Getting them to align the optics correctly really gets them a much better picture.

* Rendering - From a lot a research they discovered that you want to pull high 80s FPS (90hz is the standard now), so your brain is no longer subconsciously aware of the image flicker and thus you stop remembering this is just a display.  You need a lot of power to maintain this frame rate, but there are some new concepts helping to make it more attainable.  The PS4 is only pulling 60hz for VR.

* Audio quality - a good set of headphones goes a long ways.  I always go with some that just about cut you off from the world.

* Probably the biggest thing is  hand tracking.  One to one, sub-millimeter, high refresh rate hand presence blows people's minds at first, but their mind quickly adapts and views these as their hands. 

Once you get these in place, a game doesn't have to be too great, but people have all kinds of rules for games they make up to try and increase the feeling of immersion.  These are just some things I worked on to get a universal, "holy fuck this is amazing" response from the people I demo for. After playing Deus Ex, I will be an early adopter of that shit!  Well, yeah. You make a compelling point. But then again, *zoom capable eyes and doctor octopus tentacles*. I'm not a wise man, but I know which side I stand on. I'd recommend Jim Sterling's video on it, he deftly sums up most of what I think the problems with it as a product are. I'm on mobile right now but look it up if you're interested in an opposing point of view.

It might catch on, or it might not. I'm always hoping for the best, whatever that is, and I'm excited to eventually try it either way. I wish I was smart enough to know where to invest money with the VR thing. Whoever picks the right product or company to invest in that ends up becoming the standard is going to make a killing. Richie's Plank Simulator with a real plank and box fans really takes over the senses no matter the VR experience. Also people have different levels of [physical sense and awareness of their own body](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception) Was waaaay ahead of her time and expected Wii mechanics.

Chantix. 

Yes, the stuff that makes you quit smoking. If you can make it through the 3 months of crazy, without your family killing you, or you killing yourself, it's got the same effect after it's out of your system. 

I can't hardly smell cigarette smoke without wanting to barf.  I mean I feel like yeah that is just another day on reddit
Now if someone references u forgot polend or ytmnd in general... Sometimes, things are born.  They live, and then they *stop* living.

*Forever*. So, in what ways did you compare to what? 
Details man!  You guys are sick psychopaths It's pretty fucking cool already.  It's typically filmed from the actor's perspective (though there are exceptions) and the 3d effect is really, really good when it's well done.  The common players allow you to align yourself to sync up with the actor and whatnot. The 3D sound helps way more than I thought it would too.  Porn stars whispering dirty lines into your ear = neat. It's already a thing. Go get a cheap $15 headset for your phone and enjoy. Bro, I have some good news for you....the waits over. Imagine VR Star Wars. Bah, with enough money I can buy the high-end augmentations that don't hit it so hard, and some gene therapy to restore my Essence enough to feel pretty human. 1 essence only mean i need to spend .9 more.  give me that chrome chummer.

[✓] Dunkelzahn  2150: Scientists are now planting computer DNA into developing cells that will enable a fetus to grow with embeded hardware. Is the video about the current version of the product, or the concept as a whole? The former is pretty irrelevant since it hasn't even been commercially available for 2 years yet, or something like that. It's in very early stages.

It's a fun concept, so there's no reason to think that it *won't* be a big thing in gaming in the future. HTC seems to be doing it right but their smartphone division is killing them. But they did just sign a deal to work with Google for their new Pixel phones fr st least 2 (I think?) years. And they have great phones, just terrible advertising. So maybe their stock could shoot up.

I nearly threw up you sicko. I have it DRM free from gog.com. Look up something called "CorsixTH." It's definitely worth playing again. Made me relive some of my early video game experiences. Bullfrog offered the official download for free a while ago. Maybe it's still there. I played it again and it didn't disappoint.  I got it free on Origin.

We'd then have them take the survey and put them at different heights and in different situations and see how their answers changed throughout the test. I wasn't the one who came up with that experiment. I was a student worker helping with another set of experiments they were running at the time and I just helped with pieces of programming when another one of the workers couldn't figure out what needed to be done. i.. holy shit.. lmao

Hilarious guy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX47ABsBI8g Boxtrot anyone? Man, this was real fun the first week it was out before everyone picked infiltrator cuz inviz. I wish it stuck to the more CS feel that MGS 4 MGO had. But maybe that's just me. Hyped for MG Survive (yes, I know it's a cheap cash in, but the FOX engine with survival and co op? Hell yes.).  "War has changed." So they've basically reinvented prophunt. Legit tactic. I don't understand why they don't ship more boxes to Iraq. ISIS won't know what has hit them.  When MGS2's AI is smarter than you. ! Its kinda crazy but I think this is the first post I've ever seen of someone actually playing metal gear online...  Why does it look like the other player puts their gun away to tie their shoe? UPS delivering death What's in the box???? If you have children, you'll know the big box is always the best part of the gift. In Soviet Russia, prop hunt you.  Huh...it's just a box. I have played about 50 hours of MGS V online and have seen these videos.  I use to sit there thinking "How the hell could you even fall for that!?"  50 hours later I have been killed by a dude in a box like 10 times.   That console aiming I think she works on one of my FOBs. This makes me want to play more mgo!!!  Though mgo and mgo2 are offline, oddly enough you can play metal gear online with peacewslker from the the collection on PS3. Looks a lot like the Box Trot. That's the one game mechanic Metal Gear is famous for and he doesn't see this coming? i would be paranoid and gun down all the boxes Source   https://youtu.be/xX47ABsBI8g Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX47ABsBI8g
His name is Charborg and he's really cool, you should check him out. "Boss.... Is that really you?"  At least link to the fantastic video it's from.  This is Jack. This is Jack in the box.  " surprise motha fucka "  "Operation hidden dunkey activated..." Back in the day I used to work for a game developer called Capstone and the had licensed the original wolfenstein engine for a game called Corridor 7.   One of the best innovations were you could play as an alien who when motionless would morph into a barrel or a plant "Oh hey, a box."

"SURPRISE BITCH!" Sniper: No. Can't be. He's playing a Metal Gear game and he's not suspicious of boxes?Smh to me the online in MGSV was a big letdown.. i couldnt even create a party to make sure me and me and my friend played on the same team, way too much lag, servers shutting down suddenly, lack of game modes, slow progression... idk i loved the game.. but with a better more stable and developed multiplayer it could have been THE stealth multiplayer game many have always wanted to play. I so wish you could have MGS4 stuff in the FC4 engine. :( ! This is from charborg's video. He is great. Everyone should check his channel out. Never played MGO but I just have a question. How come people don't  just shoot the boxes right away when they see it? Wouldn't it be obvious to do so? Is there tons of boxes in the maps?  How does anyone not just go around shooting any box? ...how do people fall for that!? What's in the box? Still wondering why people keep falling for the box trick.  How do you not know!!?!??! I'm out of the loop here, is online released for PC? How can an open box be suddenly attached so firmly to the ground, that instead of taking the box with you as you stand up, the sealing on the top flaps open? Are there enough players in MGO? Should I buy it on Steam? Lmao reposted for the 4th time.

This shit is fucking unbelievable Surprise Motherfucker
 Jean-Pierre Treiber' style.
 Awesome  I tried to play this yesterday and there was 1 person playing  Do people still play? I could never find games Ice to see you! You thought it was just a box, but it was me, Snake! People still play this game? I remember the net-code being terrible when it launched. Has this changed? terrible  why this  man is hiding in the box. he is more visible to enemy dont you think that And it's now thanks to this game that I will forever question cardboard boxes in random places! I remember never being able to use the box effectively back in MGO2 (aka MGS4). Even when I destroyed an empty box and then planted myself right on top of the place it had just been, all the enemies seemed to be to identify me in less than a second. 

I know there was a skill that helped you spot the enemy more easily, but this seemed to happen every single time I tried it.  AN ILLUSION!? Played like a fiddle. SURPRISE MODAFOCA The first thing from gaming I've ever liked. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLIK5HYkVQE https://youtu.be/DT2X5b0tyDI I just wish we could use the gunsmith from singleplayer and that it didnt die out so fast. Reminds me of [people conspicuously trying to hide](https://gfycat.com/OpenDefinitiveCopperhead) in DS3 Huh!? Just a box!? SUPRISE MOTHERFUCKER!!!!! People talk a lot about Halo 2 online and games like that being their definitive online gaming experience for multiplayer but for me it was MGO back when MGS4 was out.

There was something so frantic and captivating about it, this was also back in the day when you could play PS3 online for free, so just icing on the cake. I still remember box-popping as a strat too haha. In that MGO when you equipped a box it immediately put your character into a crouch and if you unequipped the box you would stay that way. So a lot of times you would turn a corner and see two players equipping and unequipping boxes frantically while straffing try to realign and nail that headshot.

Something I also liked was their ranking system. A lot of your ranking had to do with individual performance, so if you played well, but still lost a match you could go up in rank. Same with if you played terribly but your team won. Nothing was worse then seeing a "- -" next to your name after a match. Rankings started at 1 and went up form there, and a majority of the playerbase was around 7-11 usually. I always sat around a 10-12 but sometimes I'd run into a guy that was like 15 and these people were unreal at the game. Everyone was all mixed in with eachother too, so it just added to this frantic chaos of a platform.

What I remember most fondly were the lobbies, the matches were all created by users so while there were your standard Team Deathmatches and Stealth games if you scrolled down far enough you could find role-playing games set up with no weapons enabled and people just running around pretending to live in the maps. I spent a lot of time meeleeing people in those games to knock them out, seeing how long I could mess with the quiet residents of this tiny town until they all voted to kick me.

I didn't mean for this to get so long, I just think fondly back on this game and I hope everyone that plays games online gets a chance to join a community and meet new friends and build memories. Because there isn't anything quite like it. Tactical delivery. SUPPLIES! Surprise motherfucker !  Do people still play this? (On PC particularly)? The worst part is the tic rate.  did he really go and tie his shoe Oh how I miss this game! Is there a decent online community for this still? Idk if I just don't know how to search or not but it seems that no one plays it anymore :/ Stealth is a vital part of Metal Gear Online. I feel like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYfpo9w0XBQ) will be appreciated here.  There's a metal gear online?! Wait didn't I play that on my psp like forever ago? I'm so out of touch with Metal Gear I may as well have been living in solitude on a mountain. Does anyone remember the Metal Gear acid games? I loved those.  Love this Snake snakkkkkkkkkeeeeeeeeeeee Was that there before?.... Please do not answer.. I SAID DON'T ANSWER!! people stll place this? Do people still play the online? I always loved it M
and may look into trying it again "Jack in the box"  Stealth in MG is a very important part of the game. What the Box? http://store.steampowered.com/app/527340/ So it actually works!
 Tactilebox “Not snake” ! I love the confetti type stuff that comes out. "Surpriseeeeee! :D" You're good at being BOX. I love the packaging peanuts that fly out of it. Pretty fun in TF2 as well. This reminds me of the original MGO for PS2. So many memories of boxing and headshots. I dont know why i laughed so hard at that but i did. I can picture some hardcore gaming getting shot that way and having a total meltdown. Lol.  I'm really enjoying the single player campaign of MGS5 so far, but how's the multiplayer in general? Are there still enough players? How do I enter it? And why the hell does it keep stealing my money when I'm offline?  omg , what is in the box ... aaaaaah a ghoost  That literally never happens unless the player is brain dead or a noob, this game is shit too, i dont get how people still play it after the first 3 months. This game isn't even a quarter of how good MGO2 was smh. Special delivery That was totally out of the box.  Boo muthafucka! Is it still possible to play I have the phantom pain on steam If it helps Had no clue this game existed! Gonna check it out **!** Made me laugh out loud.... Too funny.
 Was that box there when I got here...? lol I never though anyone in game would ever fall for that Is this a throwback to the old NES Metal Gear game where you could use cardboard boxes?  Bravo  What does the box look like to the other players? Completely invisible? They can't actually see a box there, right? Not sure what is worse his ignorance of the box or you thinking out would work.   Lol. Surprise cockfags! Lmao the confetti  Which metal gear? PFFT. If the netcode lasts that long. PC is Sad. They finally fixed the latency delay, but now the matches keep getting disconnect errors. SNAKE! !!! Shouldn't the programmers occlude the vision of the player when they're in the box? So hiding in a box really does work. Shoulda spy checked. Snake your radar isn't affected by the weather Kinda forgot i owned this game .-. Ha, you can see the moment of realisation.
 The worst part about mgo for me is that I go straight from the main game and being a near invisible badass to the online version of me getting picked off every 3 seconds while trying to hide A weapon to surpass Metal Gear? Suddenly I want this game I wish people still played MGO.  Hey its charboard  I have yet to play this game (though I plan to) - what do other players see when you're in the box?  Theres a metal gear online?!? dessert camo box! nice repost Gg Isn't this a repost? no, the best part of metal gear online is how many people are cloaking and fucking ruining the game.  At least give credits to the OP. Charborg is a great Youtuber check him out. The reposts? [Link to OG video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX47ABsBI8g) Who sent me this killagram? Snake in the box. Full awarness on that guy! I wish people still played this is MGO worth it? [This.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ_Tt4FT-M) #SURPRISE MOTHA'FUCKA! ! I didn't call an uber I'm here to deliver some bullets :( [Stealth is a vital part of metal gear online for all players.](https://youtu.be/nLIK5HYkVQE) Stealth is a vital part of metal gear online for all players. I was waiting for this You can just shoot every single box. The game has marking system where you'll have a marker stick above your head for the entire enemy team to see if someone looks at you for a few seconds through binoculars.

However, if you get into a box and jump out of it, leaving the box behind, the mark will stick itself to the box, meaning the enemy team can't see you anymore.

As such, pretty much every box you see lying around the place is empty, and just used as a decoy. Even if someone does hide in a box, there are a few ways to determine they are beforehand.

The Enforcer Class has a field report ability which makes a little pulse sound when an enemy is within a certain distance. If you hear a pulse and there's a box nearby, chances are someone's inside it.

All that being said, you can break a vacant box just by running right into it. They just fall apart, as long as nobody's inside. When someone is inside, though, you've just walked right into their arms and they're probably gonna choke you out and send you off to Funkytown on a magical balloon ride. Well MGO is part stealth so that defeats the whole purpose of being stealthy.  I don't see any rat Pokémon in this gif. 'S JUST A BOX.... Is that how guns sound to you? I think more a of a ZIP ZIP ZIP. Ha ha.. that's just the way it is. . . . Old enemy AI's feel super realistic all of a sudden Spray and pray* Anyone playing metal gear and not shooting boxes is doing it wrong  That takes me back to COD 4.

"You guys suck, teammates!"

"Hoorah. That's how it's done." Video games that do this are SHIT. One person quitting shouldn't end everyone's game.  I'd always become host too whenever they quit. And I was like 10 years old. So I'd usually get bored, or my mom would make me do something, then I be sad because I post poned the game. You can place boxes and get out of them to act as a decoy. In older MGO for MGS4 I think they would spawn randomly. I'm the one who made this video and it took me a LONG time to get the clips. It doesn't seem like it because of editing but 90% of the time people see a box and shoot the fuck out of it. But then there's those couple times where they don't notice and they look SO dumb lmao 
  
e: the guy changed hs comment. it used to say something like "how do people not see the box and realize its a person?" >Global warming is a myth

>edited 1 minute ago


Did I just walk in on a shitstorm about to break loose? [Not really](https://youtu.be/GlGugvLwM7Q)

Edit: Guy above originally said: "Do people really see randomly placed boxes and not realise they're players? especially if a box appears in a place where you have been walking 2 seconds ago, and the box was not there yet. i guess some people are just really, really bad in scanning their surroundings. Do you not realise that the guy knew someone was hiding in there and wanted to use a different weapon? [It's just a box.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msf_J3QIXMg&feature=youtu.be&t=11s) This is Metal Gear, it should be obvious by now that 9/10 times any box you see will have someone hiding in it.  Came here to say exactly this. He looked at the box in some random place and didn't shoot the shit out of it.  Mug.  Sorry, I'd be inspecting every box. Sometimes, At times it may seem ridiculous but pending on the situation a player may be focused on other players.  I used to hide near other boxes so some players would overlook me, other times players would use boxes as a distraction, so an obvious box in one location would be used as a kind of trap that draws the opponents attention to it.  The opponent in this image may have been new or just oblivious though (or suffering from lag...which was all too real in this game).  I don't know if you know this but boxes also show up on radar as a member of your team, so you can leave a box wherever and your opponent will see it as an enemy on the radar (hence the ambush tactics I mentioned earlier).

The only thing I'm 100% certain of is that MGO ingrained it in my mind that all cardboard boxes must be destroyed. Perhaps the whole concept is more rational then we first thought. Huh? It's just a box. Can we get back on topic because no one has really explained, surely players very quickly grow to be suspicious of cardboard boxes on this game?  This isn't witty yet I can't help but respond with lmfaooooo ty for Confusing the fuck out of me with that edit... Am I missing something? Why the hell is this the top comment?

Tears of laughter. Yea please go check out this guy, his comedic timing is amazing  Remindme! 2 hours Just watched your GTAV spiderman video. Made me laugh out loud! I just wish they created a different title rather than trying to awkwardly shackle this new game into the MGS franchise. Nothing stopping them from making this game under a different title using the Fox engine. Hell it's even their right to keep the gameplay largely the same if they wish. 

But as you said, it's a cash grab. I can't support it. I would rather Konami just shut down their game division and focus on gambling machines. It's uncomfortable having something sentimental to me bilked specifically because I find it sentimental. If it's a fun game and immortality is discovered then in 100 years I shall play thus game, but no sooner! They say Survive won't be "priced as a AAA" game. If it's something like £15 then shit, I'll be buying it. It's not a proper Metal Gear game but who cares when it's co-op and that cheap? Oh shit prop hunt!! That shit was soo fun.  Other way around. Except this came out two years before prop hunt.  *inadvertently They're switching weapons. "Excuse me ma'am, I need you to sign for this please."

"Oh, what am I signing?"

"Your death certificate." *ratatatatatatat explosions guitar solo* Always a +1 for a good se7en reference  And cats That's just shitty low sensitivity 'Aiming' I play it on PC but with a controller because it's more or less optimized for that. Then again, aiming will always suck indeed.  Sweeping Charborg Def plays PC.  CHURNBURG Hes playing on PC  Speaking of things that bother me: Watch_Dogs. A lot of the running around is best done with a controller (particularly when you get in cars), but combat is best done with mouse + keyboard. You're not kidding! That was hilarious. Has been since, like, January. I'd like to know this as well Since before the start of the year, DLC and all. Player count is really low though, as to be expected from the changes they made from MGS4's MGO. It's a tactical box  The PC playerbase for MGO3 is pretty much dead (and even if it wasn't, I would not recommend it unless you are looking for a Call of Duty clone in third person view with fulton recovery and a few questionable design choices).

 Ps4 has the bigger playerbase Snake in the box bleh belh b blehb bleb ble shut up dude, mgs5 is one of the best game on ps4 I wish they hadn't shut down MGO2 which was much better IMO. :( ❗️ It's an extremely sad news. :( Breeeep! I don't know why but that music plays in my head everytime I see that exclamation mark  Thank you, Dark Souls. The like/dislike on that video is unbelievable  how does one get a cat for hair? Why don't they just shoot the boxes > You can just shoot every single box.

Great, so I do that.

> However,

I don't see anything in the following text why I should not shoot every single box. Or am I missing something?
 That actually sounds like a decent system. I  I know some of these words. What about weapons with surpressors attached? The stealth mechanic in this MGO (MGO3) is there for players who want to RP.

Realistically, this is just a 3rd person Call of Duty set in the Metal Gear universe.


If you want *real* stealth gameplay, get yourself a hacked PS3 with a custom firmware, and play MGO2 [on the SaveMGO servers](https://savemgo.com/). _A wild Ratata in a box appears!_ Check again. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnIpjrMLUGc I was relating on this guy:
https://youtu.be/W0wU3Zb3S50
(The "G" is silent) MGO is special.

Not only does it end the game, you lose all experience and points you obtained up until that point in the game.

So you'd have games that are 99 Bounty Hunter, the losing team has 1 ticket left, the winning has 3.  Games been going on for maybe 45 minutes.  Host is on the losing team and quits.  Bam, it's like those 45 minutes don't even exist.

But it's okay, because they have 5$ ponytails. /s I loved the first MGO is there a current way to play? I love how it was probably a serious design challenge in the online gaming to make cardboard boxes less suspicious and to deter people from thinking there was someone hiding inside one.  I would just shot all boxes anyway  Never played any MG game, but why in MGO don't players just shoot the box? Same thing for Subsistence you just broke the spawned box and hide over it with you're legit as
Hell  >  In older MGO for MGS4 I think they would spawn randomly.

I'm baffled why this doesn't happen in MGO3. they spawned randomly in peacewalker, too can I play mgo with you hahahahahaha, i figured i had a good run while it lasted, why not change things up a bit. Well if you sit there and don't do shit, yeah, it's bound to happen. Just like good ol' prop hunt maps. Ya after he looked around for a while and thought hmm was that box there before? They need to have a bunch of different randomly generated disguises, that way when people go by they'll think, "Oh, that's just a trashcan.", or, "Oh, that's just a pile of leaves.", or, "Oh, that's just a German shepard.", or, "Oh, that's just a homeless guy drinking mouthwash.", or, "Oh, that's just a washing machine.", or , "Oh, that's just a transvestite prostitute with big hands and a jaw like a jack-o-lantern.", and so forth.

One of my favorite content creators right now.  Lol /r/games is leaking, someone please go grab the plug Still is, my friends got me to start playing PC and convinced me to get Garry's mod.

"I AAAAM THE ONE AND ONLY" blasting out as you try desperately to avoid all the pyros homing in on your now beaconed prop. I play PC now but at the time I made this gif it was Xbox!  nope Yeah, but... how? its tru boon yep which is sad considering the story is only half finished and the online wasnt half as good as MGO2 Huh!  What was that noise? You've got mail ;( praise the sun? who could dislike dunkey 60k to 440? That seems right.  Also shooting every box is a great way to let every enemy hear where you are constantly. It seems that shooting every box would make you extremely conspicuous.  There are many decoy boxes that will not have anyone inside.  This was my interpretation of his comment. Mainly because there's a small chance that someone is actually in a box, and people more often than not don't use silencers (actually, pretty much never). The game has a sound system where sounds you make will appear on the enemy's radar. Carrying around a suppressor for the express purpose of shooting boxes means that you screw yourself out of other, way more useful attachments just on the off-chance someone's hiding in a box. And without a suppressor, you're just giving away your position, which is pretty bad.

Like I said, walking straight into the box breaks it anyway, so most people opt for that approach, even if it is kinda dangerous. A box can be a hiding place for both your team and the enemy team. If you can make a list of decoys in your head, and keep track of them, you'll be at an advantage. That is, if no one decides to shoot them all. However, the overwhelming guilt of committing box genocide will haunt you for the rest of your life Singleplayer wise, suppressors degrade with every shot. Dunno about the multiplayer though. The suppressors wear out after about two magazines worth of fire.  Shooting up every random box you see would waste much of your suppressor. I believe they wear out Crysis 2 certainly had a major stealth component to its multiplayer due to cloaking. Rattata used Automatic Rifle

Nope, servers are gone MGS4 was the second MGO. The servers got ahut down in like 2012 Same as another game with amazing stealthy multiplayer, the last of us.

Yes. It's horrid. My favorite thing is to sprint around the map in the mech thing and kill everyone, completely undermining the stealth aspect The last of us is awesome. It definitely has a learning curve, because it's slow but brutally unforgiving, but it's fun as hell. ... Knife(?) all the boxes?  A good pyro anyways.  So many pyros just run past everyone without giving them a single puff.

Friendly Fire servers though... spies are god and pyros are basically useless. You'd be running around, looking for people to shoot, and *suddenly* **what's this**?! "Oh, it's just a Venetian fishmonger's stall.", or, "Oh, that's just three children on each other's shoulders in an overcoat pretending to be an adult.", or, "Meh, just a 17th century sculpture of the Madonna by Baroque Italian sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini.", or, "Oh, it's just just a pigeon eating a bag of chips.", or, "Why, it's nothing more than a fully restored lime green 1971 AMC Gremlin with optional chimpanzee co-pilot.", and so on. CARNIVAL PRIZE MOTHERFUCKER I'M RYZE MOTHER FUCKER  RED SNAPPA!  CREAM PIES MOTHERFUCKER Most of my friends who watch the show haven't had it spoiled, surprisingly. I'm just saying, it's kinda rude to just throw out a big spoiler like that. Like, huge spoiler. Ayyy Charsenpai finally got a PC!  charbooger, is it hard being batman? voice_enable 0 

is your friend, In fact, even better, something like 

Bind mouse3 "toggle voice_enable" Well... did you give him the cummies?  I can confirm. G-Mod is an abomination now. Every server has a godawful loading time because of all the custom files. All the kiddies had their parents buy it for them after seeing their favorite YouTuber playing it. When I play it I feel like I shouldn't be on it because every voice around me is someone who can't even drive yet. thanks for watching my shit <3 fair enough Parasites?  You're that ninja. :D :( :D Well that and Dunkey found out who the REAL Jontron is. SNL app. Thank me later. Let's not forget Konami's way of registering to play. I remember trying to play the beta. You had to go onto the Konami site to register a username. Then you had to do the same on the metal gear site. Then you can try logging into the server using both usernames and hope that the system isn't down because Konami doesn't know how to run servers. MGO3 still has terrible network issues though lol I think I only got to work once. EA / origin need to be taught this then.   I have that problem with the current MGO. I frequently get disconnected or a bad connection from the host.

I don't have this problem in other games, so it isn't my dorm's internet.

Not to mention barely anyone plays MGO on 360. I can usually find a group or one other person to join, then more people will join over the course of half an hour, but the lack of players is ridiculous.

Doesn't help that there are five separate servers for each console and PC. One for 360, one for PS3, one for Xbone, one for PS4 and one for PC. Way to split the userbase, Konami. I used to play MGO2 a lot as well. Nothing comes close to that game, not even the private server that is still up. I tried it a couple of years ago and it was nice but there wasn't nearly enough people playing to keep it entertaining. There was a small surge of players when the new server came online, but it died down again once people realized it would never be the same. Especially without survival. The best we can do is hope that another developer draws inspiration from it one day.  http://savesavemgo.com/

 Like the game Hmm, so it is... At least the updated their site footnote to 2016 Well the fifth game kinda ended up giving you the choice to do either, without much of a problem. I guess just be thankful that is a viable stratagey in the Metal Gear series now! But I always enjoyed the stealth way more, and feel very underwhelmed by V's to be totally honest, I could only put 25 hours into the game. Never even beat it, but from what I heard, it's a very good thing I didn't being such a big MGS fan. Sad the fifth's end had to suffer so because of the fallout T_T I still play the multiplayer. It's probably the most fun multiplayer I have ever played. Being he last one alive against four people and still winning is the most amazing feeling  I am not sure I quite got your point yet. Care to elaborate? All exquisite examples of course! I just wanted to let you know I love you and you made my day APPLE PIES MOTHERFUCKER Veeery tasty! I'm afraid no. I don't mind people being young, it's just the immaturity that gets me.

I remember when I used to play, I could have a good banter or two in game. I could talk to people like a normal person would. Now it's all wanna-be "memesters" or "trolls". It gets so annoying. It's not shit, sir, it is beautiful art  >You're that ninja.

Dunkey is that you? Snake? Snake?! SNAAAAAAAAAAAKE!!! I need scissors! 61! oh that sounds juicy, what happened between these two guys? Please tell me that I won't experience any issues being a non-resident of USA. Issues with the app that is. I have no issues with Trump memes thusfar. Yep. That was my introduction to online multiplayer on PS3. I thought it was the biggest headache and thought all other games were going to require some ridiculous login like that. Thankfully I was wrong and it was just Konami being Konami. Your message was an up and down wave 😂. Upvoted. 

Edit : Because Konami is Konami and Konami doesn't know how to do anything #fuckonami  I think you forget how bad things used to be, though. 

Like Battlefield: Bad Company had terrible latency issues and the servers were only like 20 people. Voice chat was horribly erratic, too. 

Now we have fairly silky connections and awesome voice chat and servers with 128 people.

Things have definitely changed quite a bit. That's one way to get fired Wow, that one's even more dead. >Like the ~~game~~series

FTFY It would get to the point where nobody is actually shooting or killing *anything* because everyone is disguised as some kind of mundane object. By then the game will have evolved to it's true form: An object simulator. Because let's be honest here, who among us hasn't ever wanted to play a game where you stand in a corner for seven hours pretending to be a coat rack? [And what a grand day it shall be!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBq2gB2sNk0) IN DISGUISE, MOTHER FUCKER. ZIP TIES MOTHERFUCKER I'm on vacation right now, and i had a long airplane ride coming here. 

While on the airplane, i got bored of the movies and loaded up steam in offline mode. Garrys mod was there so i played single player on flatgrass, no addons nothin. I haven't touched that game in at least 5 years.

first thing i built? 
a floating cage for father gregori with a trap door. Underneath him i made a pit. for the zombies.

i know i know.. people can build waay more intricate things than my little piece of shit cage (i even forgot how to use a lot of the tools so the trap door wasn't even bound to a button or anything, i just unfroze it with the phys gun and let virtual gravity do it's thing). but it was enough to entertain me and my non gamer girlf for a bit. A Hind Dunkey? Look up "the jontron rant" on YouTube. (I'm on mobile) You *should* be fine, but, unfortunately, I don't have too much firsthand experience using it abroad. Definitely try it out, though. Well, Battlefield 2 had pretty stable online features, even on the 64-player servers (heck, even 1942 had excellent online services). 
Although that's on PC, I've never really played online on consoles, but I can't imagine it being more difficult to get right 'over there'.  God I loved Bad Company 1 and 2. I still hope they make a third with a lighthearted campaign again.  Improved prediction and interpolation go a long way into faking that smoothness. It is why there are so many WTF multiplayer gaming moment videos on YouTube. I think all that happened is that *you* got better internet service over the past couple of years. Network technology has definitely improved over time, but not by that much. Highspeed internet hasn't even become more accessible to lower income households thanks to all those monopolies. Silky rubber bands, yeah.  Wait what has 128 person servers? [removed] Name checkd out. Ah, the ol' reddit [Metal-Gear-a-roo](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/5c384j/burlington_mayor_bernie_sanders_picks_up_trash_on/d9tmgun/) Men, the only solution is to create www.savesavesavemgo.com BAPTISE MOTHERFUCKER WHO DIES MOTHERFUCKER on it, thanks.

Edit: lol that was friggin' awesome. OH MY GOD, I NEVER KNEW! [JonTron is Jacques!](/spoiler) Many thanks  as soon as the communty isn't running it, it gets REALLY hard for it to get right. Thats when they pull out some shitty P2P solution to save on bandwidth.  I still get down with bad company 2 these days. Theres somthing about it. The character models. The fun multiplayer.  The destruction and vehicles. Map design. Well, I definitely did, but back then, I still had Comcast cable internet, and it was the fastest available in my area (about 12Mbps). And that's fast enough to handle the gaming of today with no real problems. 

Things were just worse back then.  Hold my robotic arm, I'm going in! That link just goes on forever. I clicked around 20 deep and realized I still have no idea what the joke was. Hold my cardboard, I'm going in! Hold my time card, I'm going in! Holy fuck are we still doing this? Fuck it, hold my D-Horse, I'm going in.  TRUE LIES MOTHERFUCKER Arica harbour in rush mode is one of my all time favorite bf maps.  I have the game on Steam but there were only two empty servers in the server browser. Do people still play? OSTRACIZE MOTHERFUCKER  Idk.. I'm starting to think it's just a dude dressed up as a robot  I mean they did try a little bit, when you actually play AS him and get hurt you don't see blood around the screen, you get like weird fuzzy stuff instead I dont want to be the wierdo debating a joke but... the robot characters dont hold their breath, when you press the button to steady the scope it makes the sound of servos locking up. Also when shot they dont bleed red so its probably oil or something. Glad I checked out when dogs were the big showcase Why? Why was I programmed to feel pain?! [deleted] To be fair, everything in multiplayer is humans jacked into a neural interface doing combat trials. They just so happened to choose a robot avatar. Seriously, its canon for BO3. The singleplayer and multiplayer happen at the same time and are connected storywise You went looking for logic in a Call of Duty game. Half of these are wrong. It's not drowning, it's overheating. The vents close while underwater, you hear them open and the cooling process when it resurfaces. It doesn't bleed. At all. When you're damaged while using Reaper the edges of the screen have a digitized effect rather than blood. It also doesn't become heavier when you activate the built in weapon. When you pull it out you move at the same speed, but you slow down when shooting to keep it stabilized.  For the water it could be argued it wasn't designed to be in water in the first place, I mean all the multiplayer maps do take place in land and the water would be easily avoidable for the ones that do have some. As for the cracking of it's knuckles like bender he could just do things he doesn't need to because it makes him look cool, As for the rest i got nothing. But you've got to admit, Reaper was the most badass of the characters. Maybe not what everyone played as, but easily the coolest. Also, when ADS with a sniper rifle, you hear gears and such locking into position, when underwater, he starts fizzling, like water is getting into places its not supposed too, and when surfacing, you hear water venting. The only way I can explain heavier with minigun is he limits his movement to provide a much more stable firing platform to take the massive recoil of a vulcan. Cracking knuckles, I got nothing. Either way, not defending CoD, just saying the Devs did go through the trouble of making it make a tiny bit of sense. Also doesn't get turned off by an EMP [deleted] A) Stops it's robot air cooling system.

B) Isn't built to modern robot waterproofing standards.

C) Leaks it's red robot lubricant oil.

D) Uses robot energy to mass conversion technology to produce weapon components only when needed for maximum robot space storage efficiency.

E) Readjusts robot hand joint actuators. I don't think people understand that BO3's multiplayer is just a simulation in the storyline.  1. STABILIZING INERTIAL DAMPENERS FOR MAXIMUM ACCURACY
2. WATER FLOODS CRITICAL SYSTEMS AND FRIES HARDWARE
3. LEAKS
4. BUILT-IN WEAPON DRAINS ENERGY RESERVES BELOW OPTIMAL OPERATING CAPACITY
5. LOOKS BADASS Momentum wheel stabilization, short circuit, coolant leakage, Built in weapon causes CoG change so mobility is throttled back, and re-aligning slipped stepper motors.  
Best excuses I could come up with. Don't play call of duty. Support creativity. Call of duty for me became unappealing after black ops 1, I played MW3 and really couldn't get in to it. 


I probably had the most fun in MW2 online though, I mean I know it was plagued with Aimbotters, quickscopers, boosting lobbies and kids, but the first time I got a nuke using a machine gun on Karachi I was proud.


Plus, I genuinely achieved a golden skulls banner thing for the AT4-HS rocket launcher or whatever it was called, 3000 multi kills or something required for that thing.  https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/43nyvw/black_ops_3_logic/

Great repost to be fair this is the franchise where you throw a knife over a four story building and kill a guy by hitting him in the foot so expectations should have already been pretty low on the "realism". Do they get tired after sprinting for a while? Still a better game than Infinite Warfare CoD lost it's logic long time ago.  No need to develop a unique character, with unique abilities, then go through the trouble of balancing the game accordingly. Just create a glorified skin and have it behave like everything else. That way we eliminate risk and any potential impact to our release schedule.

Profit. It's a figure of speech, Morty.

They're bureaucrats, I don't respect them. why does knife kills robot? There is a legit explanation for each one of these

Holds breath?  Maybe just slows functions down since moving parts you know, move, decreasing accuracy.

Drowning?  You know, fried circuitry.

Bleeds?  Hydraulic fluid.

Heavier with a built-in weapon?  Probably just bearing itself down to avoid falling over.

Cracks knuckles?  metal joints, rust build up, IDFK.



 Don't forget *can't control pistol recoil  If the robot had all those capabilities, it would be very unfair for the humans.  Drowns in second checks out... electronics [Because all COD games have always been so realistic.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ac/dc/80/acdc804032b7b07c02dc506f3bf2c86f.jpg) I have to admit, playing as a robot is a big lure for me.Iv not played a CoD game sense ps2. Might be time to check it out again. 1: Servos stabilizing. I imagine he has a lot of motors and engines that keep him fidgety.

2: Blocked cooling vents or oxygen vents or something. I'm guessing he's nuclear powered so if he doesn't open his vents to cool off he might just shut down.

3: Is it blood?

4: Stabilisers again. A huge weapon like that with a huge chain clip could require him to not fall over from recoil or accidently jam the gun from an arm movement.

5: devs can be silly sometimes. Activision Logic: Keep making Black Ops 3 >cracks knuckles

Do they chuckle? This doesn't look like anything to me Rumor has it Sledgehammer's CoD is going back to boots on the ground, and to the Vietnam era.  No more Derpy ass booster  packs, wall running and future sci-fi shit with Roboids and space ships.  Hopefully the rumor is true.  *..doesn't look like anything to me..* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_C0IjjEz2E You must hate that moment in Titanfall 2 where the Titan gives you a thumbs up because its emulating human actions. When Reaper is damaged and the screen gets bloody, if you look closely at the blood it's pixelated like a computer screen, so it's not actual blood it's just a visual representation.  looks like they (lazily) applied the same mechanics from the player character to the mech. This was one of the things that bugged me the most about this game.

I'm Spectre. Killer assassin. So effective that my true identity is shrouded in secret.

*10 seconds under water*

Hyperventilating like I'm drowning him.

Wtf. Black ops 3 is top 3 of my favorite multiplayer games. WoW and CS:Source round out the rest. haha cod sucks am i right guys wheres my free karma at Gotta reuse those animations if you're aiming to continue shitposting games. None of that is really true

Holding breath to aim a sniper: If you listen it sounds more motorized like it is stabilizing the shot.

Dying seconds underwater: This is how almost any electronic works underwater. Go test it with your phone

Bleeds: It doesn't Bleed at all, go check again.

Being slower with built in gun: It's not heavier, it's just moving and shooting at the same time. So its being more precise.

Cracks nuckles: Simulates cracking nuckles to seem more human like People always say they want human robots. Besides consider it an early synth.  Someone apparently needs to play the Talos Principle.  R/totallynotrobots  This isn't news worthy; My
Roomba does all of that, too. I can understand it dying immediately when being fully submerged underwater since it's made out of electronics but...yeah.... Fish A.I had come a long way. Are there more people playing advanced warfare than bo3? Just curious, recently got both and it's hard to find hardcore lobbies. Also apparently I can fly, walk along walls, turn invisible, and slide like 30 feet. I think treyarch got confused as to which franchise they were working on.  "Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?" Well I have a theory. In Block ops 3 the multiplayer is just a huge simulation for who this organization is gonna hire next (that's not the theory that's the canon part of it) but what if they made the simulations as he can drown an such to make it an equal playing field  A robot reuses a people script Kovalev got Robbed!  Ward clearly didnt do enough to win. 
 Yeah, this is a weird one. I've got it on PS4 because the Mrs is a big fan of Call of Duty games and I play it occasionally, the classes and stuff seem so weird to me. 

Really makes me miss the Modern Warfare stuff with just regular people and weapons I understood. 

Is the player base on the MW remaster any good on PS4? I fight for the user! that's what happens when you realise all your characters are standard military dudes and try to spice it up at the last minute  I dunno about drowning, but its not unreasonable to think that a robot falling under water could quickly become useless.  Then again, you'd hope that they'd make such things waterproof or water-resistant, else what good can they do ya when a storm comes out of nowhere. [https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops3/comments/3s8jkq/massive_spoilers_discovered_something_huge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops3/comments/3s8jkq/massive_spoilers_discovered_something_huge/) It's Call of Duty. They abandoned logic after the fourth game. If you had an autonomous sniper rifle, I doubt it would be moving, just automatically shooting at intervals of time. So, being able to aim and shoot a rifle from a robot no longer makes it autonomous, and therefore you would need to halt all servos and then "click" the sniper in place before shooting it. Running, then breathe shooting a sniper in a robot suit. Nope. [Show me where in the rulebook it says a human can't be a robot?](https://youtu.be/kiAjdNkSuns?t=23s) Now initiating fart sequence. [R One-Oh-Seven?](http://timesplitters.wikia.com/wiki/Robert_One-Oh-Seven)  Awesom-O oh shit it's JD from Grandma's Boy!  Instructions unclear, reskin unsuccessful. yeah, Robots don't need to breath, never mind all the other junk.  And you hear vents blowing out water when you resurface from the water after a long time. I also think the "holding breath while sniping" sound is joints tightening down for fine tuned shooting, not really breath-holding. After all, it's just a series of fast clicks. It's all a simulation. The entire thing. The specialists in the game that you play as were all kidnapped or some shit, forced to fight in some hell-like warzone against their will. Thus being the reason why none of their birth dates line up with the actual year in the game. Even the fucking robot is an AI that is in a simulation, basically. B-B-B-BLOODY SCREEN!!!^so ^real! yup, all these are BS, and I hate the direction CoD has gone. 

* Holds breath while aiming - Is steadying himself
* drowns in seconds under water - closes exhaust vents
* bleeds - sprays sparks
* becomes heavier with build in weapon - most likely steadying himself again, due to recoil. 
* cracks knuckles - assuming its an attempt to mirror humans I don't want to be the weirdo but who the fuck is looking for realism in a COD game? Go play Battlefield if you want realism. I don't even play COD anymore, but the people circlejerking it are so stupid they can't come up with anymore reasons to complain about it. Just the same complaint every time. If the servos locked up, they wouldn't unlock so easily Aviation hydraulic fluid is commonly Red.  but call of dooty !1!1!1!1 /s
 why would a robot even need to lock up servos? It doesn't make sense.  World at war dogs were terror Do you remember the fish? "Hey we're on a cruise ship. Let me release my dogs." I'm glad I stopped at BO2. I could sort of tell that things were going downhill from there. 

However, I do miss MW2 and MW3. Those games will forever hold a special place in my heart. That was around the time "dogs" was the showcase for every game:

* Fallout: DOGS!
* Fable 2-3: DOGES!
* Dragon Age: DERGZ!
* Call of Duty: MOR DUGZ!!1! World at War? everyone I know IRL loves BO3, I've literally only seen people shit on it on Reddit  World at war was one of the best call of duties you missed out  i ghosted with the release of CoD;Patrick swaze. that game was awful
 The black ops 3 campaign is one of the best I've played. Don't forget the fishes that swim away when you get close to them. [Father, give me legs!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xZ_KQhv8T8)  Thank you for coming to this thread to clear things up, Mr. Robot, sir! > That is merely me closing my vents for added stability.

Why would closing air vents help with stability?

>Those are my essential oils and lubricants. They are red because of the chemical compounds high in iron found within. Iron because I am a robot.

Why would oil have iron in it? It's a lubricant, not a resource delivery system like blood.

I'm not sure you're a real robot. Screenshot yourself completing a captcha, or I don't believe you. The whole MP is just a simulation, actually. The specialists you play as ingame (the robot being one of them) are being forced against their will to kill each other. There's an actual story of it and everything, if you want to look it up. but wait, in the single player [SPOILERS] you find out that it was all a dream, so then how is the multiplayer canon? Is the main character dreaming that as well? On top of that, the black market dealer straight up references the part where he got shot up by you and your friends during the campaign. Even though technically, that part never happened.... I hate black ops 3s campaign. its like looking for historical accuracy in any game really

(with the only exception i can think of being JFK:Reloaded) > You went looking for **realism** in a **game**.

The *logic* behind it is to not give the specialist any unfair advantage. I hate these game "logic" posts because they're usually not about logic at all. Every developer puts thought into their game and its features.  The logic is that it's a fucking video game. Why insult Call of Duty? This is actually a thing, or at least in science fiction.  Robots get programmed to mimic human behavior to make them seem less sterile and alien.  The robots in INTERSTELLAR for example  Everything can easily be argued with the fact that it is a video game. A game that made decisions based on balancing, not realism. ''Thank you, for choosing, this fine, Coalescence product.'' Cracking knuckles is just something the creator threw in because it's cool probably There are modern shielded electronics that would remain functioning during an EMP, I'd imagine your futuristic tactical battle robot would be similarly equipped. maybe the robots have emi shielded parts, or maybe it is a game designed to be fun and not accurate. but then again, it is black ops and therefore none of those things. I don't get it really, I thought it was easy to hate CoD but apparently OP can't even get those reasons right i lost it at 'red robot lubricant oil' I always like Black Ops the most because the maps were really good, it was a lil slower which made for great Search and Destroy (don't even bother playing this much on the newer games I've played), and gun games were a fun addition. Yeah, MW2 and the first two of the BO series for me. All this other shit they released with alternate moving systems isn't doing it at all for me. I also couldn't get behind MW3 or Ghosts. Sprint is unlimited for everyone If that's the case, it's definitely time to check it out again. And don't listen to what everyone on Reddit says about it, give it a try for yourself and make your own opinion.  Black ops 3 is a really awesome game, campaign is pretty fun but multiplayer is awesome. Don't listen to the CoD is dead bandwagon. Infinite warfare is basically a blops3 reskin, so besides it being a little boring to people like me who played BO3 a lot, you may like that as well. its not nearly as bad as everyone says. Check out infinite warfare I'd give Titanfall 2 a chance first. Wanna play a robot? You got it. How about playing as a robot while piloting a motherfucking mech!? Ya got that too! If you want robots, go for Titanfall man, you can be a robot, piloting an even bigger robot. Blops 3 is great "Chain clip" 

This caused me physical pain It's just as frustrating as it was on its original release date. BLOOD NOT CIRCUITS!

Doot-doot. **vibrate sound**

 I am your servant.
 
I am your worker. Why would a robot even have shaky hands though? That a completely human fault.  So like Enders game but less awesome? RANK UP!!

MASTER SERGEANT SHOOTER PERSON! It's not supposed to be realistic, it's an arcade shooter.  That's it. People will upvote anything just to circlejerk about cod > becomes heavier with build in weapon - most likely steadying himself again, due to recoil. 

This would only matter when firing, such as the spin-up time for a Gatling gun (say it's hydraulically planting support spikes in the ground before shooting), not general movement.  Imbalance would be automatically corrected and adjusted for, since a robot off the assembly floor would have been designed to accommodate such weapons. What's the point of closing your exhaust vents if you're a robot that can't go a few seconds without open exhaust vents anyways? That makes no sense! Makes sense. Except the last one probably > drowns in seconds under water - closes exhaust vents

That actually makes zero sense though, why would you close an exhaust vent from water? Only your air-intake vents should be closed. If you're looking for realism in battlefield you're gonna have a bad time. Play Arma,Insurgency, or Squad instead. If yoi are on console you are SOL  cuz hating cod is the cool thing. you don't even have to make sense anymore.  Says who? It's the future. "locking up" does not necessarily mean "stalled"  Maybe should be the sound of whirring up some gyroscopes instead
 If we reeeaaally wanna get pedantic, servos would be a terrible way to provide axial motion to a robot like that. You would want a hydro-pneumatic system. *OUR HOUNDS WILL TEAR THEM TO SHREDS!!*

*THE DOGS HUNGER FOR THE FLESH OF OUR ENEMIES!!*

God I love WaW. TAP F TO

NO WAIT Q

AWSD AWSD AWSD

You died Those dogs are pussy cats compared to the dogs in pripyat I always felt bad about killing dogs in campaign ,  but when it was multiplayer , it was me or ol' yeller. I love how they made it so you couldn't stop them unless you got really lucky spraying a full clip at one. 

the whole knife it thing was so broken it was sad.  With a brand new Fish AI system, your player will now admire the wonderful aquatic wildlife instead of the game. /s Oooooh I member Oh fish that move out of the way!  Like...in Mario 64.. The funny thing is that they would actually come from inside storage hatches and swim in from outside the map when you called them. It was super funny seeing these ferocious military dogs doing the doggy paddle in the ocean. Black Ops 2 was the last COD game my friends and I really enjoyed and played the crap out of. I was never crazy about the series anyway, but it was always fun to play with your pals. BO2 had great maps, good zombies and was just fun. 

After that I remember buying ghosts and hardly playing it past the first week of owning it and eventually my friends and I moved on to new series or just stopped playing games in general.  [deleted] I mean it went downhill for 2 cods but BO3 was great BO3 was one of the best cods gameplay-wise of all time

The bullshit crate gambling for dlc guns ruined it You think things were going downhill with black ops 2 but not with mw3...? Tbh, I just hope they release another standard BO2/BO/MW2  style CoD. Ground based, lots of guns, non of the silly jetback slide spam shit. ITs been long enough now that I feel like having one of those to play again. Love me some MW3. On x360 i still play daily. G36C reddot silenced ftw They hopefully learn from BF1 that people are sick of futuristic shooters. I'm so sick of every shooter coming out involving flying in some way. Infinite Warfare has the best Single Player campaign of any COD IMO.  I recently bought MW2 and MW3 again with some of my friends there's still a lot of people playing 3 online  Those were such good games.  My friends would have online parties, and just fuck around in the game... we were pretty bad. i'm glad people still play mw2 and 3 to keep it alive, great memories with those games MW2 is my favorite and completely godlike. theres a modern warfare 3?

 I actually just started back on MW2. It's still really good. I thought the game would be full of hackers and kids but tbh it ain't so bad. No worse than any other shooter anyway. I played BO2 for a couple days, couldn't get into it, and haven't touched COD since. I regret nothing. I started at BO2 I am going back playing BO1. I'm team Treyarc all day  To be fair dogs are fucking awesome I dunno, the showcase for Fallout was "We're an RPG without magic and full dialogue trees!" The focus on dogs only really started with Fallout 3.

Though the only Fallout with playable dogs was Tactics. It's pretty damn fun. The Ultimate-esque abilities, high mobility, and pretty well designed maps, along with pretty balanced weapons, make it a fun grab-and-go shooter It was the first cod campaign i couldn't make it through. The acting was just so terrible.  It's one of the worst imo. Doesn't deserve the black ops name attached to it. > Mr. Robot   
   
*Triggered* ALERT, A ROBOT HAS BEEN FOUND, FELLOW HUMANS, SEEK SHELTER FROM ITS SUPERIOR DESIGN AND FORTITUDE!  It did happen. You're reliving the memories of another persons missions as you die on the hospital bed. Blackjack stole all the other multiplayer characters memory chips before they were killed. sans spectre as he was the one hired to kill the others. /r/dayofinfamy 

About as close as you'll get in an FPS 

EDIT: Mount and Blade: Warband for medieval stuff although it's not based on real history, the armour and weapons correspond fairly well and the combat comes as close as any game I've seen  [deleted] What about Kingdom Come: Deliverance? It's reddit. Where posts like this one and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5a763m/a_comparison_between_past_halo_games_and_new_cod/) make the front page. The field of Human Robot Interactions actually has a lot of academic research into that specific topic. It helps people that interact with the robot connect with it, which is usually a good thing. *Humor setting at 10%* Yeah but the the truth is much less fun. Yeah but that's boring. Look at this like /r/asksciencefiction

Answering questions with in game logic is more fun.  For reals though.

A robot cracking its knuckles is pretty cool I thought the first black ops was pretty good [deleted] BO is the best for me as well.

On PC it has community servers and even full of gamers at weekends now. And the black ops 2 maps are the best. They even look fresh. Wouldn't BO3 be better? I have both but the only thing IW does better is the Campaign imo. >Check out ~~infinite warfare~~Titanfall2

FTFY



 Yo dawg, I heard you like robots, so we put a robot inside your robot to kill other robots. But le cod is shit!1 Chain fed magazine of clips Hello, sir.  Have you ever thought of signing up with Talon?  It's not a "Terrorist Group" as the media falsely portrays it.  Think of it more as a mercenary guild focusing on and supporting missions to protect humans from the ever-present Omnic threat.  You get to choose whether or not to sign up for whatever missions are available, Talon negotiates for generous pay on your behalf, and you get to determine your own uniform or uniforms. If you ask me, the Brits have their heads on straight! Omnic rights, PHHHHJUH! They aren't all murderous robots. Look at Zenyatta.

\#omniclivesmatter IM CARRYING YOUR BABY, GIRAFFE!! THIS REPLY TO THE ABOVE COMMENT ACTIVATED MY VERY HUMAN REACTION IN MY CENTRAL PROCE... I MEAN BRAIN OF COURSE HA-HA-HA SEE IM NOT ONE OF THOSE PESKY ROBOTS Smell sequence initiated. Seventeen.

 I spent years failing miserably at Nice Threads and then one day managed to get platinum at the first try, and then continued to platinum it when I'd play it again. I thought at the time it was very cool and I'd entered into this sort of 'Neo understanding the Matrix' state when running through it, but then I realised I'd accidentally put the sort of energy that could have taught me an instrument or language into Timesplitters 2 - a worthy FPS but nevertheless on the scale a waste of time. Also one that tragically doesn't allow me to compete for them big bucks. I really don't get how there wasn't space in the FPS genre for Timesplitters. I realise Overwatch is a different class-based game but a major draw is the charm/character which TS has. Seems like EA wasting another franchise only one game after purchasing it. I knew I would find others who to this day, still wait  > Doot-doot.

Praise Mr. Roboto I may be shaved, but it doesn't mean things won't get hairy Correction servos, a robot would be constantly moving, tightening down just shuts off all movement after taking up the slack in bearings etc >tightening down for fine tuned shooting

Not because the robot has unsteady hands, but for greater precision.

My idea wasn't exactly supposed to be read into anyway, or the whole concept really. It's not like with robotic infantry/cyborgs, jet packs, and plasma shotguns that BO3 was really striving  for realism. I haven't read that, actually. But if you want to call it that, then go ahead  RANK UP!!
SERGEANT SERGEANT MASTER SERGEANT SHOOTER PERSON! *overly long guitar riff plays* "I am an enemy as well!"

BORING

BORING

BORING Oh yeah? Well you're a towel! https://youtu.be/cn7hHGQXxbE I though that regenerating in seconds from a bullet to the heart was a clear indication of this. Yeah, CoD sucks! Do i get upvotes now?

But seriously though, this circlejerk has been annoying. People complain about CoD being the same reiteration every year. Now that they move away from old-school fps and into futuristic settings, they still get shit on. Every cod thread goes like this. 

"I really enjoyed COD THAT CAME OUT A WHILE AGO." 

"Yeah I could tell they were getting desperate when COD GAME came out." 

"I thought COD GAME was really good though."

I seriously feel like I have special snowflake deja vu every time a post about cod is made.  Yeah, they'll Upvote anything Well, he does move at normal speed when running. He only slows down when firing. I *think* it'd be a similar reason as to why you don't want to get water in the engine of a car. Doesn't play nice with internals and so on?

Not sure, tbh! That's like asking what the point of holding your breath underwater is. Closing the exhaust vents can give them the extra few seconds they need to get out of the water.  What's the point of holding your breath if you can only hold your breath for a few seconds?

Because sometimes you need those few seconds without breathing/open exhaust vents. Water inside a robot is much worse than an overheated robot. Well, reaper actually has a story where he's the only class of his style robot left and for some reason has developed an inkling of an AI system. Like that robot in overwatch. Thats right I always forget about Insurgency. The reason I dont like it is because of how realistic it is I'm from the future. It's worse, it means it's seized. That sounds cool.

Or its just super accurate all the time because its a multi billion dollar robot from the future. That game was brutal when you look into it. And classic zombies was King. None of this 500 step semi secret Easter egg to find a super weapon crap. Just you, 3 buddies, a ton of WW2 guns, against a horde of zombies a psychotic disembodied little girl. OUTSTANDING MARINES!! OUT-FUCKING-STANDING!!!! WE KICKED ASS! My first FPS on PS3. Recently got it for PC for nostalgia's sake. It holds up surprisingly well, but that sniping mission with Reznov is a bitch to get through in veteran. A ENEMY RECON PLANE. RIGHT ABOVE US!

A RECON PLANE RIGHT ABOVE US!

OUR ARTILLERY WILL TEAR THEM INTO PIECES!


I miss playing online on the Wii. It was fun and hackers only used XP cheats that affected their entire team. I miss those good old days. F And the Pripyat's pussycat is the Chimera. It's like any other cat, except really big, with two heads, and it ~~wants to kill you~~ nevermind that, all cats want this. I love this refrence, but my mind is totally blanking on where it's from. Context clues point to COD, can someone tell me which? Knifing worked fine, and you could down them pretty easily if you had decent aim. The trick is to actually hit them. Worked fine for me. All about timing. You just described me. I started on Cod4, grew to love the series into MW2, black ops was different for sure, then MW3 went off the rails and actually made me dislike the multiplayer. BO2 saved it, but Ghosts killed it for me. When I saw BO3 had super jumping exo suits I NOPE'd the fuck out of there and went over to battlefield and now rainbow six siege. Yeah really felt like ghosts was the beginning of the end. Couldn't really pinpoint why that game didn't feel good. But did like some of the map change events you got if you got moab-killstreak. Are you me? I used to play black ops 2 ALL the time, and my buddies and I would play the shit out of it. Then when ghosts came out I played a few days of it and never really played with friends because the game just felt *off*. When advanced warfare came out we had all moved on and played other games, and we sort of picked up again in black ops 3, but none of us plan on plying the new one  Dunno what it is, but everything about BO2 was so perfect.  Cod4 + MW2 for me.

MW3 was neat, but not even as memorable as Blops **He** misses MW2 and MW3, maybe **you** miss COD4, but not everyone does

edit: It's possible he didn't start playing COD at that point either, I started at MW2 Cause you can play the remastered version nowadays which is kinda the same. I loved every second of BO3 gamepplay, the crates I didn't really give a fuck about since none of the weapons from it seemed that appealing to me. The only thing I hated about the game was the map design, every map was the same 3 lane bullshit so they all felt exactly the same Seriously, MW3 and Ghosts were garbage.  BO2 was so perfect. The BS ppl on here say sometimes... I really enjoyed MW3. They expanded and refined what made MW2 great At least MW3 had a good campaign. I don't think people realize, but when they did that everyone complained that they were releasing the same...now people are complaining because they tried new things.  I play both MW2 and MW3 for PS3 almost daily. its a choice between two things, hackers and campers I also sometimes play mw3 on the 360. I love that there are allways still a lot of people online. ACR6.8 silenced FTW Oh I agree, but it became a crutch - as in you'd watch E3 they'd spend 20 minutes showing how your "DOGS SHIT sticks to his ASS FUR!!"

WOWZ

Too real!

So DOG

Much WIN! I was specifically talking about 3 which was at that time I agree. I got to the last mission, asked what I was doing with my life and never picked the game up again Also [verdun.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerdunGame/) [deleted] But BF1 did too by bringing Americans in to most of the WW1 battles as well as including a ton of experimental automatic gun that came either at the end or after the war was over. Nobody wants to play a competitive shooter with only semis and bolt action rifles. BO2 is my favorite call of duty of all time. I didn't think anything would beat CoD4 for me but the amount of time I spent playing BO2 was absurd   >Yo dawg, I heard you like robots, so we put a robot inside your robot to kill other robots *inside more robots*

FTFY Bitch, I *AM* Talon as the RNG Gods has bestowed upon me: https://redd.it/4ykv7y You made talon sound a lot like how the thalmor think of themselves Torbjorn is basically the racist uncle of Overwatch that the family likes anyways BUILT TO SERVE!!! Zenyatta seems like a pretty murderous robot to me. Those metal balls are no joke CONFIRMATION AFFIRMED. AFOREMENTIONED JAPE TAKEN IN STRIDE. HA. HA. HA. 101 Hey don't sell yourself short- 100%ing TS2 is no small feat. Probably one of the most difficult accomplishments in gaming. 

Regarding Nice Threads, I don't think it's possible to get anything less than platinum. The only way to advance forward is to get in front of the the robots. Once you kill even one (or die yourself), you're gonna have a bad time getting by the bots in the tunnels. It's not even the fact that they're shooting and killing you, they're just so big you physically can't get by them! You need to run as fast as you can from the start and not stop. 

Actually, I take that back. I think the first time I ever beat NT was with a bronze metal where I literally spent like 15 minutes blasting my way through the tunnels slowly progressing. And dying hundreds of times. I finished with seconds to spare and was like "yay?" All that work for a meaningless medal. 

Whoa, sorry about all that, just taking a trip down memory lane there.  bearings and joints and control mechanisms should already be really tight.  they don't just 'take up slack.'  why would you design a robot that has loose joints? does a turret on a battleship need to 'take up slack' to fire its main gun? no. Also it should be noted that ~~Legion~~ Reaper was a prototype of a discontinued line of robots, so there is reason to believe that he would have some wear and tear or flaws on him.

EDIT: Just remembered the robot's name is Reaper, not Legion Dude. Go fucking read it, it's one of the best books I've ever read. Plus Orson Scott Card predicted today's Tablets and modern internet precisely and it was written 30+ years ago.  RANK UP!! SERGEANT MASTER SERGEANT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL SHOOTER PERSON!  No, *you're* a towel. It's not about the setting though, but just as much about mechanics and other innovation, which a lot of people find to be lacking.  CoD sucks, so does EA and Ubisoft, also pre orders are bad. I'll take my 4 thousand upvotes now please  And people eat up the new Civ game every few years. I mean they bring out a AAA game every year, with plenty of new multiplayer features that get updated throughout the year. I hate the microtransactions but hey it's 2016, and it's not like EA or Valve don't do similar things.

But it's reddit. So do I jerk to the right or the left? so a futuristic robot uses a combustion engine instead of an advanced battery? I fucking loved insurgency because of that it gave me cod style maps, battle field gui, and realist combat it's amazing. Hey it's me, the future That's what I meant. Locking can be a feature, like a brake or clamp. You're fixation too much on the exact word the person used.  I hate how BO3 had no mini-map (like Town from BO2). You basically had to deal with all the easter egg bs every single game. I still believe Nacht der Untoten is the best zombies map. It's crazy to me that they won't just make zombie mode simple again. The whole fun of it was how easy it was to just hop into a game and try to work together with a group at a very clear goal. Now I jump into zombies and there are all these weird little rules that I don't quite understand, and I don't feel like I should have to do research to figure it out. Here's how I would do it: There's five mechanics every map would have

You must turn on the electricity to access certain doors.
The mystery box
Every 5~6 rounds is a dog round
There's the four core perk colas plus one that's unique to the map
Pack'a'Punch is somewhere

After those five things, every map can include one, maybe two, extra mechanics. This could be linking teleporters, monkeys instead of dogs, the moon landers, low gravity, maybe some collectible you need to unlock pack'a'punch.... No more than one of these in a map, maybe two after a certain amount of testing. 

That way, the *casual* game mode doesn't require hours of studying youtube videos on how the pros solve easter eggs just to play them. Of course, the specific map layout design should focus on giving players multiple strategic options to choose from, but this comes after the core five plus one mechanics are in the game. IMO Tranzit was the perfect amount of Easter egg stuff. Classic is great for what it is, but Tranzit has tons of crazy shot without getting too bogged down by it. Good ol' Keifer Sutherland
 Fuck yeah that mission was intense. First ever mission to start you off camoflauging with dead bodies.. Very reminiscent of COD4s ghillie mission. You can say all you want about call of duty, but you gotta admit some of their set peices will always stick with you I couldn't believe how populated the MP still is, but I was happy to find out.  Fuck man I can't even do it in easy.

It's like when I played the Last of Us.  Got the hunting rifle, go to sights, and suddenly that rifle is moving like it's underwater. I definitely remember jumping under the floor on that mountain map on the wii. One of the only things I remember about it - but 100% had more than just xp glitches.  Ew. The Wii version was a joke Same! That game was fantastic on the Wii. It was so underrated.  I haven't played for a while, but I'm pretty sure he's referencing a mission in COD4. At one point, you come up on a dog eating away at a dead body, and you have the "option" to kill it or pass. The catch is, if you kill it, a ton of dogs come after you until you die. It's a guaranteed death. Modern Warfare 1. Also switched to R6 and never went back. Yup this is my exact sentiment. The first black ops was actually a very good game. The maps from cod4 and mw2 were a lot better but the gameplay was fairly even once they fixed snipers I loved the first two modern warfares but I hated MW3. All it had was robot kill streaks running and flying around the map to kill you every time you spawn. I traded that shit in to GameStop real fast.  I started at COD1, clearly the best of the series. Anyone else member COD1? I member..... I have to say, COD4 really did shape a generation of call of duty. The basic, yet solid game mechanics set up to what would be an inevitable shit show of game physics.

Particularly, MW2 bounces knives. BOUNCING. LETHAL. KNIVES. I started at COD on my PC. I miss those days. I started at MW2, I miss cod4, mw2, and mw3. I started at MW2 as well but I did love CoD4. I used to be such a cod addict during my teens, it just stopped being fun for me one day during AW. I was loving it, until I just started hating it for some reason. I still get flashbacks about my kill streak being ruined by martyrdom grenades in Cod 4.

Still the best one though i also love CoD4 but it had its problems. Grenadier being ridiculously OP, attack helicopters and almost no way to deal with them so it turns a fast paced game into everyone hiding in doors for the remainder of its duration. Shitty spawns Until they release a standalone I don't even consider it re-released. I miss it so much but I refuse to spend $130 on it.  Advanced Warfare also Yeah it did, that's true.  I think people cared about the frequency of it, more of a good thing is great, but they milked it a bit too hard imo. Yep...MW2 Hardcore TDM here. Fucking hackers ruin the best COD made. Usually after enough team killing they'll leave.  Also nice, almost g36c on gold. Then ill move on to that one. Add me! Gamertag : akaper87 Lol dingleberries 'historical accuracy' 'verdun' nice joke there mate ArmA is realistic, not exactly historically accurate lol My ps3 died long after i maxed prestige in that one.  Oh, Mr. Pool, I hardly recognized you!  Shall I fetch the usual for you? If Torb's the racist uncle that sits and complains on his ass, then Zarya's the insane aunt who actually acts on it. He's also the canary in the mine shaft. If you see him on your team, you lose  Look at me, look at me, this is a /r/Overwatch post now. It's for the greater goal of [peace](http://i.imgur.com/tAZ6HCC.png).  HI FIVE. 101/01 with rice I haven't played this game in half a decade and I instantly recalled the level you're talking about. Such a fucking pain. I'm not sure if I got Gold or Platinum, but yeah it definitely took hours of effort, spent across days. 

I too had the funny little trait of hey-look-I-did-the-thing-after-not-touching-it-for-weeks. It's such a grand feeling. 

I have literally everything in the game unlocked except for one fucking character, and I don't recall who it is, but its one of the Privates I think. This thread makes me want to dig out my ps2 and give it a whirl..  The "correction servos" that he was referring to would be ones that compensate for irregular terrain, retained momentum from a movement, etc. I would argue though, that it's more likely that the upper body would elevate to a single load bearing point and use a gyroscope to retain angular stability, and those are the clicks you're hearing. And yes, you're right, there's no "slack", but a battleship's main gun does have mechanisms to correct for its movement.  Actually it kind of does, there are gyros and servos that input slight movement corrections to the gun to compensate for the movement of the ship in water and slight drift, this is the only way it can become 'stationary' and fire accurately.  ok dude lets give only the robot character perfect aim and let him instantly shoot anyone in the game


oh wait it's a fucking game RANK UP!! SERGEANT OF THE MASTER SERGEANTS MOST IMPORTANT PERSON OF EXTREME PERSONS TO THE MAX! Why are you angry?  Advanced Warfare introduced jet packs, Black Ops 3 introduced power sliding, wall running, and specialist abilities, and Infinite Warfare introduced a new grenade throwing mechanic which lets you shoot while you cook. No matter what's added on the core of the gameplay will just be run, aim, and shoot before you get killed. The added mobility from BO3 helps spice that core gameplay up.

How much do people really want CoD to deviate from MW1 anyway? Deviate too far and it won't feel like CoD at all anymore.  Alright, but what innovation does, say, Battlefield 1, offer over CoD? The way I see it Battlefield 1 is a reskin while all the new stuff CoD tries is seen as "the exact same game".  Electronic systems generate heat. Look at a gaming computer. If you covered up all of its exhaust ports, it would overheat in a matter of minutes if running at full load.

Being "futuristic" doesn't mean the laws of thermodynamics suddenly stop applying. We don't know... 

They probably just thought about reasons why it would do such things because in the MP if it didn't have to people would complain.  hey its me, ur future

youre homeless now. The Giant? Psh Der Reise was where it was at Do you mean Kino Der Toten? 1) Ascension 
2) Kino
3) Nacht
4) The rest It feels like you need to have done several hours of research and attended a pre-game planning meeting. You mean you *don't* want thirty strange steps to do instead of straight up zombie killing? Get outta here with those lies.

I swear, their zombies level design includes a lot of drugs and an potpourri dartboard.  I would happily pay £60 for a game that consisted solely of Nazi Zombies maps made in this style. Ehh, even Tranzit was too much for me. The secrets and easter eggs got too much somewhere around Acension or Call of the dead. *Gruffly whisper or yell.  There is no try.* Wii cod, while removing some gimmicky features(chopper gunners, flamethrowers, cameras) was the best. Aiming was the easiest of any console and I'd say better feeling than pc, graphics were simplified a la csgo. 

It was like a pc shooter without the extreme 420 dropshotters with optimal loadouts you found on pc LMG, MOUNTED AND LOADED! {-}7 Black Ops is probably my favorite COD game of all time, no absurd technology everywhere, just classic gunfights, with the fun of the RC: XD thrown in there.

Not to mention playing hours on end at Ascension, and during the Nuketown 24/7 events.

Also, Die Rise on Black Ops 2 was an extremely fun map. I started with Medal Of Honor: Rising Sun, wait wrong series.

*I did love that game on gamecube doe* Call of duty/finest hour , I member. Naah WAW was the best, you could go outside without death raining down on you from the sky. Artillery took a while to start off and Dogs could easily just be killed, so much fairer than Harriers and Helicopters.  Member CoD2? Meeember Carentan....member the KAR....


I member...  :'( i miss those days none of this future clickbait mind vomit, just good ole bolt action rifles, submachine guns, and leftleaners  COD1 was great. Big maps, 64 players, kinda slow gameplay. The expansion with vehicles was good too. Started at World at War on the Wii, and the last COD game I got was Finest Hour. Oh I member: Dude i still hop on every so often just for kicks. Rifles only at harbor. TWL/CAL tournaments. Headquarters gametype. I was in love with rifles only and  made a mod where the Americans would get a mosin Nagant, then people perfected it so no matter what team you're on you could choose any rifle. I member. I checked out after WaW. Member the first dooty? 🍇 I member Finest Hour, I member! I remember seeing The Big Red One and oohing and ahhing at the graphics. COD3 is my favorite personally. Iron sights on the Grand and that metallic *ping* with a headshot. Cod UO>>> best modding community and it has real hardcore settings as the default  Not as good as [General Chaos.](https://youtu.be/RDmCsA-nTIU) I got in with cod 2 big red 1, I broke the C stick on my wave bird from playing that game too much. Only time I've busted a controller  Yeah but everything was broken and OP in that game. That's why it was fun. I did eventually go back. COD4 was simpler and was fun. Just gun skill through and through  Elaborate? How is it not historically accurate? I swear I played enough to reach master like 15 times hahahaha I didn't do much then, now if lucky if I can get a decent amount of time in on the weekend! Indubitably. Please me.

/r/chimichangas And Rienhart is the retired cop uncle who knows there's good and bad, but more good than any bad, and if everyone would just shut up they can enjoy Thanksgiving Especially on offense. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy As a Torb player you're wrong child. HARRRD VERK PAYS OFF! I'M ~~YOUR CREATOR~~ DAD Perfect. 101/111. There's also the issues with moving parts not being 100% flush, which on a small scale, does allow some play in a "tight" system He's talking about reducing clearances and removing backlash in a mechanical system, you're talking about maintaining firing solution using constant corrections. They're not as comparable as you say.

A ship's gun turret doesn't spin around all wobbly-like then suddenly tighten up when firing. All the motors, bearings, and gearing involved maintains the same amount of clearance, backlash, and run-out from start to finish. 

The contentious phrase is, "taking up the slack in bearings etc," which doesn't actually happen. It's jargon that barely means anything.  because in your world over-analysis isn't fun MAXXX* Because of this towel motherfucker. Black Ops 3 was a fantastic game, until they ruined it with the microtrasnsactions and RNG weapons. That killed it.  Idk if it is innovation that makes BF1 so good, but rather the grisly old feel to it. The old school weapons are ironically a new challenge because we're so used to playing games with modern or futuristic weapons. The vehicles are all shitty by modern standards and I think that adds to it as well. "Sometimes you gotta move backwards to go forward." - Wayne Gretzky  I haven't played cod in some years so maybe they have some of this but I'll give it a go. 

Four types of tank, three types of plane, boats, battleships, trains, zeppelins, horses, armoured cars, artillery trucks. A series of war stories that are actually worth playing. Bayonets and a variable melee damage system, maps that I assume are about three times bigger, bullet drop and velocity, context based spawn points, gas masks, prone to minimize incendiary/explosive damage, squads with four classes each with a specific couple of roles, heals/resupplies, spotting system, comm rose system, in-game chat on PC... 

Does cod have 64 player games yet? 

Edit: it's almost not fair to compare the two, they're in totally different leagues. Maybe compare cod and halo. They both have pelicans 😏 Shhh, you can't talk crap about thy holy console shooter that has no imperfections. yeah but a robot should have the exhaust system separated from the internal components , so that it can be waterproof. It's not anything hard really Perhaps, but the water would still transfer heat away This is why submarines have to come up for air every 5 minutes.  My favourite map by far. All praise the teleporter C room balcony! Kino wasn't bad, but Nacht was better 0) Der Reise I watched about 5 hours of youtube videos just to get caught on the lore up to shadow of evil. Seriously. Unless 3/4 of your group knows *exactly* what to do, you probably won't make it past round 10. Good luck getting pack-a-punch on Shadow of Evil with randoms. > iming was the easiest of any console and I'd say better feeling than pc

No, it wasn't.  Rising sun was the fucking best Medal of Honour European Assault (best game ever because you could make fun of others "you're 'a peein," that and that game mode with 1 person has the launcher and everyone has to try and kill him) That was my first fps.

Kind of pissed they never really finished the story. Man that baseball stadium level was so much fun. Me and my friends would play four player on that map and all rush for shotguns. European Assault tho Man Rising Sun was the shit. I still vividly remember escaping from the burning ship, it was so badass to me back then.  Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. Not many missions can compare to the Omaha beach landing of the original game. I was too young to remember the things I did on the PS1 version of the game. ^or ^was ^it ^PS2? I liked Frontline I started with NO ODDJOB Rising Sun had a lot of ridiculous cheats too. Like giving everyone giant bobbleheads  Member call of duty 2:big red one? Member bombing campaigns? >Dogs could easily just be killed

This is a false statement. Yeah, I prefer the balancing of the Dogs in WaW much better. It was a 7 killstreak, so Treyarch balanced it out by making it take two bites to kill you.

Whereas BO and later games made it a one-bite kill on you, since it was upped to a 12 killstreak (IIRC).

Though, Artillery was OP as hell in objective game modes, especially Domination. Perhaps not OP, but definitely more effective than an Airstrike in the MW games.

Dropping Artillery on a flag meant you effectively capture it, or prevent recapture for about 30 seconds or so.

Honestly, I just miss how quiet WaW was since there was no air support (besides artillery). Listening to sound cues like footsteps was far easier. I've only spent over 1000 hours playing Cod2 and WoW. I tried playing cod2 again last year but it was just too dated for me. A remaster would literally put my life on pause. My favorite of the series by far, I also stopped after World at War though. Oh man the memories on that one. Some of the most intense multiplayer I've ever played was on Carentan I could never get into CoD2. Didn't even beat the campaign. CoD1 and UO were the shit though. All hail the Spas-12!  On COD4? Yeah total gun skill if you don't count the claymores, martyrdom, fragx3, and that overpowered helicopter that only the other team would get.

 Already said to the other guy, it isn't historically accurate in a number of ways. Belgians in 1914 uniform fighting along side yanks in 1918 uniform at flanders.

MP18s being used at Aisne, with forest unshelled and countryside still green, could go on and on really. Ooooo, do we have a butler now? DON'T WORRY MY FRIENDS, **I** HAVE YOUR MASHED POTATOES!! I'll tell you why. They won with Tor on offence, once,  because the team they were playing against was horrible. Now they think he's a "good choice if you play him right." Ugh Piece of kek.  You're looking for the word backlash  You're seriously forgetting which sub you're in, haha, it's awesome though rock on.  I blame Activision for that didn't ruin it for me. i didn't get one microtransaction and i'm still murdering ppl. maybe git gud -Michael Scott Hasn't that been the case for years? I seriously don't understand why people even fought to see which one is better. I personally always like cod better cause I enjoyed smaller arena shooters. You seriously can't compare the two of them though. Also, they aren't called pelicans. They're called        V-tols. Aliens did it first, halo is a copy of aliens and doom put together.  It's not that they're in different leagues, they're different sports entirely. It's apples to oranges.  lol why on earth would you want 64 players on an arcade shooter map? Bloating a game doesn't make it better lol That's true, but it's also a simple matter of logistics. An open-air water-*resistant* cooling system is easier and cheaper to make, so if the manufacturers of the robots consider them to be expendable, they might pinch pennies and decide that being immune to rain but susceptible to full submersion is "good enough." Five was where it was at. Training in the basement and camping in Pack-A-Punch were both the shit. Frontline obviously was... Had that shit on Gamecube. Me and my friends played co op so many times Tiberian sun any day. Wait wrong genre. Felt like the most cobbled together one they ever put out TBH.  Member the Welrod? Best pistol ever. Allied assault would like to have a word with you Dude I loved finding the golden Buddha on the first or second level inside of crates that just had a smaller crate inside. Then BOOM. Buddha pops out of super tiny crate like 1/4 its size  It was indeed, but Frontline was my fav. That whole series was, dday, pearl harbor etc. My buddy and I would play that for hours. Best one was running around the baseball field map with rocket launchers only, because we would both inevitably fall down one of the holes as we fired and blow ourselves up. I played the MoH's prior to and i did not enjoy rising sun, i have no idea why. This was even before the internet could influence my opinion one way or the other! The first MoH was intense and I absolutely loved it but Rising Sun really did it proud after a handful of OK but not as good games.  Not my first. But the first one I played alot  I member wolfenstein multilayer with the syringe medic and the flamethrowers and the nade spamming  Big red one was my favorite. 
But when I bring it up, people tell me I'm lying.  "Brooklyn! Can you take out this wall?"

"I got enough comp-b to blow us all the way to China"

"Just clear the door, thank you" I never found them broken, just jump on top of a box and shoot and stab until they were gone. Now COD4s helicopter was broken, couldn't step outside without being mowed down. Fucking jump grenades on spawn points from across the map though.  Such bullshit.  Did people in the 40s have fucking bionic arms? It was all about pre-nerf akimbo Model 1887 Ugh the fucking heli, PTSD inducing shit right there. Get good, noob. That's why you play hc promod with all the weapons and maps of the newer CODs but without all that bullshit...

Or better yet, play COD 4: Galactic Warfare which despite being a mod, is still a better Star Wars game than EA's Battlefront.

You see, at least these games had mod support so we could fix them ourselves. I shouldn't have asked how it's not historically accurate, I should have asked how it's not the closest to historical accuracy you can get in a FPS. That's what we were saying about Day of Infamy and Verdun.  [Basically us right now](https://i.imgur.com/uR1lMyq.jpg) "Don't worry we've won 3 games in a row with offensive Torb. We got this."

Motherfucker you just played 3 games at the special needs factory. Get your life together. He works on KotH maps if you can set up on point quickly and have a few tanks to babysit.

But the same could be said about every offensive pick. At first release, a turret on an moving escort was OP.  I remember seeing three turrets once. Some people won't accept that nerfing is real.  Yeah, I think so too. But then again we don't know if Treyarch got greedy. git gud indeed The thing is they're so similar on the surface (moderately realistic console shooter) compared to Halo where you're killing aliens in a supersuit, Titanfall with the hardcore parkour and giant robots, overwatch with the... Whatever's going on there. It's like apples and... A different kind of apples. 

But you're right, it's all about individual preference and if you're not up for coordinating with at least 4 other people and occasionally sitting on choke points for minutes at a time, cod is probably the way to go.  And all of them are really just copies of this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey

 "which game is better, MLB2k or Madden?!" The fact that were debating the manufacturing process of the fictional robot character from the video game, this is getting ridiculous I played that, not gonna lie. Couldn't get past the D-Day landing. disk was scratched to fuck not as good as MOH underground. I agree. Allied Assault I played on my uncle's PS2 at the time. No mates to play with though. Just went on multiplayer killing bots Seriously, if they made TS HD like Microsoft did with AoE2 I would be so happy... Yep, and it was *really* ugly even for the time that it was released. The AI was dumb as hell too.

Best MoH was either Underground (back on the PS1) or Allied Assault (PC). They should bring that shit back as a specialist weapon in IW Well, red orechestra 2 blows them both out of the park when it comes to accuracy. Just because verdun has a few uniforms and maps based on battle locations doesnt make it accurate if it slams doughboys and frenchmen against 1914 AlpenJaegers at the somme It's not about the weapon balance, it's about the principle. I was very good at Bo3 (and previous CoDs) but that didn't stop me from not liking their strategy on crates and microtransactions. Skins are fine being behind RNG, but all weapons should be unlockable in a normal way no matter how bad it is. That's a shame because frontline is my favorite FPS of all time.


"PATTERSON! PATTERSON! OVER HERE!" I couldn't get past the D-Day landing. Just because I sucked though. The other MOH games were easier. Its been so long. I forgot about the bots. Now if I can just find my Gamecube... Didn't they?

Edit: fan made RE-mods- still cool though I guess I've seen Verdun mentioned in so many "historically accurate game" threads that I assumed it was more accurate than it actually is.  That's actually pretty fucking neat.  Ok Marty, You have to stop the train! DLC? Where we're going we don't need DLC. [Original video — Rage Cop: TIME MACHINE] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a25E9OU-xA) Burnout Paradise had the "Delorean" and it even hovered and laid fire marks. Loved that car "THIS CANT GET ANY WORSE HOLY SHIT IM BLACK" What would really be awesome is when it hit 88 mph, it transported you to Red Dead Redemption Jesus Christ Back to the Future could be an awesome game. Hey cousin, you know that new bowling alley you've been looking for? This reminds me of those special edition games that came out for a bit where you could switch between the old version and new version on the fly. Halo did it, The Curse Of Monkey Island did it too. Neebs Gaming!!! Driver San Francisco did this for a little Easter egg. When you drove the DeLorean at 88 mph, you were time warped to the first level of Driver 1, complete with wibbly PlayStation 1 graphics. Holy shit could we ban giphy.com from this sub or something?  [Reminds me of this amazing Crysis mod](https://youtu.be/DZAaKH0FYO8?t=62) "Everyone in 1955 was on fire! I never knew that." - Peter Griffin It would really awesome if travelling back in time took you to LA Noire. NEEBS Gaming!!  Ahah never realized how similar they were till now Had a little idea that GTA might be pretty good in a futuristic settings. Could be pretty damn cool actually Rage cop is awsome. I love his channel and needs gameing. oh man, i remember back when the back to the future mod was on vice city, it was so bloody amazing, transporting from time to time, avoiding cops and etc. The best part was if u set the time circuits of the delorean for example like 5 minutes into the future and then either drop it off a tall building or hit it with the KITT (in super fast mode, what-ever it was called), the delorean will travel through time, then when you wait for 5 minutes, it pops up. I thought that was brilliant. 

How is the BTTF mods on the newer gta games? Neebs Gaming on the front page, awesome! "When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some seriously shit graphics."

(Sorry.) Is it just me, or is gify complete shit compared to gyfcat?

edit: grammar Was not expecting that ending, damn cool! PC to Console trans-dimensional travel. Honestly why don't we have an open world BttF game? There are so many possibilities!  I was expecting Red dead redemption  BRING ME BACK TO VICE CITY Wait, why has there not been a sandbox time traveling game yet where you can travel to different periods and the choices you make in the past segments effect the current day?  NEEBS! Neebs  Neebsgaming! My absolute favorite gaming Channel  I must go on record as saying that I have played GTA VI (in a dream).  

That game starts with you waking up in the back of some 'random' car.  Almost as if after a long night of drinking...  Some guy (I swear it was Tony) walks up and sees me and says, "who the fuck are you and what are you doing in my car?"  Being rather groggy and unclear, I answer something like "I don't know."  He then says I'm dead an proceeds to throw a punch at my face, hence the beginning of gameplay..

My first task was to catch his fist my my hand, which I did in first-person.  A few seconds later after some struggle, he says something like "wait a minute, don't I know you?!  Aren't you so-and-so?".  I was then presented with a couple of options.  I 'spoke' the answer 'yeah man'.  We caught up yadda yadda dream forgetfulness...

The next part I remember involved the driving..  THERE WAS NONE... Cars in this game were autonomous.  You merely had to tell it where to go and it drove itself there.  I think I became semi-conscious around that time and decided to bring up the map to pick somewhere local to my real-life self.  Then an 8-bit Mario or Excite Bike shit started overlapping the map. I forget anything else after this.  I think I had to piss and woke up or some shit.. [You must lick my balls Mharti !!](https://youtu.be/EbTlK3perdI)  Dude, GTA has it all. A near perfect game I would totally play a back to the future type game where the levels in the past feature dated graphics. The further you go the closer to 8 bit and atari it gets. Maybe even a MUD level.  it looked like it even went back in time when the graphics quality were simpler.  Is that really possible in the game?  holy balls. Being oddly obsessed with Back to the Future this makes me very happy. Only if it could just gun us into a brand new GTA Vice. I always wanted to play a Back to the Future game that actually required you to get in the car and hit 88 miles per hour to travel through time. I thought it'd be cool to actually have to find stretches long enough and dodge obstacles/traffic/whatever to do so.

I think realistically it probably wouldn't be a fun game, though. That kind of travel would either happen too infrequently to put that much effort into designing, or would happen so frequently that time travel would be a chore without quick travel. (Although I suppose you could alleviate it a ways into the game by unlocking the flight mode, effectively allowing you to travel through time anywhere.) That's neat af 
So many memories  Dammit, now I want a BttF game.

A real one.  Not a batshit platformer, not a point-and-click adventure title.  A game where you drive and fly the DeLorean, fight suburban bad guys, and improve the McFly name. Needs gaming! Go follow them! They put out some hilarious content! What the fuck They should make a time traveling game combining GTA and Red dead Redemption This is from a video series from the wonderful people at Neebs Gaming (the guys who made the Battlefield Friend series and more) called Rage Cop. Give them a look, they really deserve a lot more attention than what they get. Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a25E9OU-xA
 "Why does everything look like shit?!" - Ragecop ..  This was on Neebs gaming! My favorite youtube channel ever! 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0a25E9OU-xA
Incase anyone's interested in watching the full video.

Edit. Why's there so much negativity here? I just wanted the people that make the videos I enjoy get the credit for the thing they created. Obviously you don't have to watch the video, nobodies forcing you. But it is somewhat entertaining if you have the time. [link](https://youtu.be/0a25E9OU-xA)  Gif made from a Neebs Gaming video. 
Please cite your sources to give these guys the credit they need and deserve. They got kids to feed.  That would be an amazing way to change to a new session. Clever That's heavy. "it appears that we have lost high level shader support and anti-aliasing" Does it take you to 1980s los santos?  "ah Rick what's going on, why is everything so, so" "Shut up Morty i, ehhh need to figure out why everything looks shitty....Jesus Morty who the fuck is that" "I think its Michel J Fox"   >Oh cool they added the delorean mod to GTA v that should look nice.

>Wtf how they top that?! Went from pc to console real fast  Fucking brilliant  Bravo Technically this would have to go back to GTA Vice City. but the 90's works.  That was no more 88mph This would have been the perfect intro for Red Dead 2. The matching of the foreground lifeguard tower between the timelines is perfection. That lifeguard shack was in the exact same spot Itd be cooler if it transported you to Red dead Redemptikn. this is an example of the quality of gifs 30 years from now after they have travelled the internet for decades, if only we had a time machine Nice. That is DOPE!!! This made me really happy to watch. You have to stop the train!
 Why is this concept not in every racing game I'VE WANTED THIS TO BE A THING SINCE THE GAME CAME OUT! THANK YOU! Link to the direct fucking gif.  This would be a great way to introduce a Vice City reskin of GTA V. Aww... no flames?

Also there is an old mod for crysis that is like this too. You can even jump out of the car at the last second and it will disappear, wait about ten seconds and it comes back to you.

EDIT: just realized it went back to GTA: San Andreas. Get ready to see some serious shit! This is so amazing That was cool and unexpected. Goin' back in time so you can follow the damn train Shit's tight. This also reminds me of the Nintendo 64 game Vigilante 8. Such a great game. Should have noted this is from neebs gaming. Everyone really needs to check them out. They make awesome and sometimes PAINFULLY HILARIOUS videos. They are nearly to 1 million subs and they deserve that and much much more. I'm on mobile and too lazy to link but just search neebs on YouTube and subscribe to them IMMEDIATELY. But you actually went back to the past.

To play a shitty game that sucks ass--wait no that second part just jumped out I wish they'd allow mods in single player. Hey! Where'd that Mr. Fusion come from?   Awesome! I felt this gif more powerfully than I should have.  This has to be an edit, right? If it's a mod that seamlessly combines GTA 5 & San Andreas, then I'm thoroughly impressed.  i love these GTA gifs Great Scott! Nerdgasm.  Really well done :) Woah! This is heavy. Is that Santa Monica Pier? The fact that Rage Cop is on the front page enlightens me "Oh my god!  I'm black now! " Is from GTA V to San Andreas . The graphic looks like it.... If this is me I tune to Wave 103 and immediately begin my reign of terror It would be cool if you went back in time from GTA5 to Red Dead Redemption a la BTTF3. Reminds me of the episode when Stewie and Brian go back to the past in the show where the animation was just horrid and ugly lol. Imgur is a thing.  "Oh my God! I'm black!" This is from the YouTube channel Neebs gaming  Ayeeee, that's pretty neat! Was expecting it to return to the start of the gif, pleasantly disappointed San Andreas was better anyway. Is this a legit GTA DLC/vehicle or is it a mod? Can I have this, please? In the future the DeLorean was running off of plutonium.

Once it travels back in time, it uses Mr. Fusion for fuel.

You have some plot-hole explaining headed your way OP. Should've done it backwards.  This is technically back to the past. the lack of tire marks in the sand is disturbing  Rip It's from Neebs Gaming on youtube. I highly recommend subscribing Oh would you look at that. Was anyone else hoping that this would transport the player to a GTA Vice City mod? amazing How?  Ayy Neebs gaming!! Report Ryu can't carry KT
Edit: H2K* yeah theres no videos im finding where this mod lets you play gta 5, and gta san andreas combined with the delorean. OUTATIME Damn dude a solid 15 fps I thought the Delorean was going to travel back in time to RDR and show the train! This is so beautiful I may cry How does this work? It irrationally annoys me that in the first bit, the DeLorean has a plutonium chamber, but in the second it has Mr. Fusion.  This should be next GTA + RDR.

It's the next original idea. Same place different time, but what you do in the past effects your own future... Aw sweet its grand theft auto, you can tell its grand theft auto by the way it is. That's real fuckin' neat-o. You said that because you have just seen some serious shit They also have a DeLorean in gmod. That's really nice(: MGS4 did it best with the in game flashback to the ps1 game you're pretty fucking neat :6) It's from neebsgaming, it's a pretty awesome video series. DAMNIT CJ!  A-A-Aw geez Rick! That sounds really dangerous! To RDR then! [For those who care to watch the full video, neebs gaming is pretty fucking funny] (https://youtu.be/0a25E9OU-xA) "All you had to do was get pushed by the damn train!" ["You have to lick my balls, Mharti! It's the only way!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbTlK3perdI) "I always thought you were just really friendly and hated pants."
 "Lick my balls Mharti" For real though.. Is it possible to stop the train?!? I saw one gif where it looked like it did but ended to soon and another where 100 tanks couldn't stop it. The world must know!! Said right before the introduction of Shark Cards. [Let me help out your gif there a little, OP](http://imgur.com/4uYo9Hn.gifv) NEEEBS best gaming channel will solve world peace!!! That voice...

Sounds a lot like the engineer from BFFs. giphy sucks, link directly to the gif, not to a cluttered webpage. Oh yeah! And an Ecto-1 Fookin DLC. Still best racing series of all time. Horizon 3 just knocked it from the top. Rocket League has it too. No way, that's awesome. Never got far enough in the game to notice  I had this at one point, but can't go back to use it anymore now that the DLC server is dead. :( If you ask me, that is the best game ever made. Even after all these years (8 of them!), I still play it regularly. "ALL YOU HAD TO DO, WAS REACH 88 CJ!" I laughed so so hard at that in the video. God I love these guys and everything they do. Even back as far as the doraleous cartoon. [Closest I've seen.](https://youtu.be/_m3-xw_BOwo) Driver Parallel lines is a GTA-style(ish) game that lets you play New York in both 1978 and 2006, it swaps between the two at some point during the campaign (I think when you finish you can swap between both times at will, but I don't remember).

I know it's not entirely what you're after, but it's got the same idea. **Jesus Christ: Back to the Future**

Yup, I'd play it. Imagine driving around and blasting back and forth between the time periods. I'd buy the shit outta that game. (No I would not preorder I know the rules.) The crysis mod looked pretty good.
https://youtu.be/qykCHvm4EOo Was the Back to the Future Telltale game any good? I really enjoyed their Game of Thrones attempt. it is an awesome game!

http://store.steampowered.com/app/31290/ Well there is an telltale back to the future game.... There was an NES game. It's terrible. It has about as much to do with the movie as Goonies 2 does with the Goonies movie. I'd rather love a time travelling game like the "butterfly effect" movie. All you do is try to make life at the present game time better by travelling back into the past and changing things you or other characters did there. And the game works actively against you with unintended consequences that you then need to fix etc.

Obviously, we need either a ridiculous story tree programmed, or we need true AI to invent the story as we go and change along. Just holding all the data what was done at which point to affect other things might be ludicrous. Hey its me ur niko > The Curse Of Monkey Island 

Actually they only did Special Editions for The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge.

I'd love to see something similar done for the Curse of Monkey Island as the native resolution for that is stuck at 640x480. It would be a different exercise, though, as the art isn't the pixel art of the first two games and I think it still holds up today. It even had full voice acting. Fallout 3 and New Vegas have a mod that let's you do it as well, and it works EXTREMELY well. All your info and inventory switches over as well. Favorite channel The driver games I always loved way more than GTA. Not to say I haven't had my fun with GTA.  You mean hell for 11 year old me?  It's a shame nothing ever happened with it. Incredible mod. If they could have figured out how to have multiple universes in the game, I could see that becoming really fun.  Such a fucking impressive mod. It has a fully modeled interior, it actually travels forward through time in the game (you can jump out before it travels and it'll come back a minute later), it even has the frost effect on landing.

If anyone ever made a game with the level of polish that tiny car mod has it would be a goddamn masterpiece. [In which I enter the delorean, enable time circuits, jump out, and re-enter after time displacement -- in mid air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8KIcSjrXfo) GTA sa alien city was an awesome mod back in the day GTA:SAINTSROW

Edit: FULL CIRCLE Or Red Dead Revolver. Chrono trigger?  PROMOTED!!! Nope. Thats mods and some video editing to merge two videos.  The second highest comment is OP linking to the video.. Yup. Sorta like what happened in Ocarina of Time and Oracle of Ages? Wait, you mean like using the Delorean in Los Santos to drive back to Red Dead Redemption western town?

YOU MEAN JUST LIKE BACK TO THE FUTURE 3?!

Cause if they made a GTA/RDR time travelling mashup... So Day of the Tentacle meets GTA? There's a series of mobile games/fantasy novels called Sorcery! and that is a core mechanic to one of the games.  RDR is the third movie! First we need a GTA set in the future. Now this would be a game!  Driver: Parallel lines was based on this concept, I quite liked it.  *affects Holy hell....if this was a thing, there would be a new favorite game on my list. Fuck omg. Yes. This this this 100x Rick and Morty forever, this. Shut up and take my money. That would be impossible but so fucking amazing.   You just blew my mind. How would that engine run I wonder? Lke chrono cross and chronic trigger? I remember people being upset that Farcry Primal used the same map as a predecessing game, wouldn't people be just as upset here about them being 'lazy' in using the same map? I mean, those time travel effects would have to be pretty shallow when you get down to it, games just aren't in-depth enough for you to change things with depth.  Rupauls Drag Race?  Dark cloud 2 in a nutshell.  It's only an original idea if you didn't know about the existence of Zelda games. they should make it even better and longer, let you play through both time periods, starting with the past...man that would be epic. That'd be cool the ending of GTA VI is the intro to RDR III  A new Vice City set in both the 80's and present day? I would buy that game 3 times. 

Seriously, committing crimes in the past? Horsejacking cowboys?

It would be amazing. Like Tim in Time by Sipsco Games How neat is that! They don't think it be like it is, but I do You can tell it's an aspen tree by the way it is😂 They don't think it be like it is, but it do. https://imgur.com/a/jYo8i All you had to do was follow the delorean!  Why was that mission so difficult like God damn  I just spit out my tea. I hope you're happy I like a fast ass, not a slow ass! Wow. For some reason I always saw the Rick <-> Doc Brown link as both being kinda weird old scientists, but never saw the obvious Morty <-> Marty link... There are plenty of worse places to be! Neebs sounds like Rusty from Squidbillies.

 Wait what's that line from? No Seriously. Fuck Rockstar for making the DLC content so fucking expensive! Why does Op's look so much worse than yours? I guess a better question is why does yours looks so much better? Jesus you're missing out if you don't see this better version Fucking thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart thank you. You're doing God's work son. You're the freaking best. I love you. Holy shit I didn't realize what had happened until I saw this one. (I'm on a phone if that helps understand why) It is.  It's appsro You mean /u/appsro ? Hey i dont know if anybody has told you but.."it is" It is. It is. It is. It was a DLC car. The Legends car pack. Ghost Busters car, Knightrider, Dukes of Hazard, and the Delorean all there, each with a special ability. There's no way to access it, even if purchased through Steam?  \- THEY FOUND GROVE STREET!  
\- Who?  
\- THE LIBYANS! Link? I find it funny that they based the Delorean off one of the faster cars.  In reality, the Delorean had a pretty slow engine for a sports car, and it's one of the reasons it didn't sell. Heh, I was expecting [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y306cWw98a4). That has got to be the greatest mod of all time Yes you can call a number in your rad flip phone and you go back to the other time where there is a yellow filter meanwhile 2006 had a blue one. 

It was one of my favorite games because it was the first I played where you could get out of the car and run around.  **Jesus Christ: Back to the Future: Revenge of the Crucified** It would be even better if your actions in the past affected the current world, and not just as part of a predetermined story but in a sandbox style.  Go in the past and plant some trees and see their grown versions in the future.  Maybe there would even be random changes to your changes, so blowing up a building in the past might have you find in the future that someone built a church or grocery store on that spot.  You could kill someone in the past and come back to the future to find a memorial or even that you the person's son became mayor and cracked down so hard on crime that police are everywhere. The story is actually good enough to have been it's own movie, Bob Gale helped write it and everything. The gameplay was kinda boring and generic, though. That's just a Telltale game, which is really just an interactive movie. I think he was referring to an actual GTA-or-Mafia-styled BttF game just another trashy telltale game niko berry I'm just reminded of this reference in the 2006 point and click adventure game Runaway 2 (spoiler): http://imgur.com/Wp80wb6

The look isn't exactly as comic cartoon as Monkey Island because [it's a dream sequence](/spoiler) and the game has no comic cartoon elements. Detecting a fellow Monkey Island fan. 

Damn those games were awesome. Need some new adventure games.  Tale of two wastelands? Wait what holy shit? Link? PROOOOMOOOOTEEEED! Never tried it, but im really getting interested in that idea. Im already imagining a lot of different things and i think it could be damn interesting. Maybe thats a step they can take with GTA 6. Oracle of Ages and Seasons were fucking awesome games.  And Chrono Trigger. I was thinking more Futurama. Pretty much, yeah. I was hoping for a long time that the next RDR would take place on the same island as GTAV.  The main drawback being the lack of Mexico, which I fucking loved from RDR. Trevor in RDR would be pretty funny. Well, now the idea's out there. So once it comes out for PC, someone is going to make that mod.  Oh my. One of my most favourite games ever. I truly wish the true 'point n click' genre can come back. 'Lucas Arts' stuff was amazing. I just don't think the market is there anymore for the 'true' point n click games. 

The Monkey Island series is up there with the best games ever made...imho of course. I really miss that genre of games.  I played it again recently.. in full HD!

https://youtu.be/g6v-zGTzNCE

 Are they as hard as nails but with the amazing humour? Day of the tentacle I completed without major issues but they bloody Monkey Island games were absolutely solid...and I liked it. 

I'll look Sorcery up... games are so 'instant gratification' these days. I used to spend weeks stuck on a monkey island game - that was the buzz though! Fuck yea sorcery! The last one was epic but I'm a little sad there won't be any more. I loved that game. The first Driver I played since the original. It got a lot of hate and the fighting wasn't great but I've always been a driving fan. The time change element was really fun and the soundtrack was awesome Plutonium.  But to get to 88mph the engine runs on normal gasoline. 

Invent gasoline when you get to level 20! That's pretty neat! The neatest!  Is it neat or more neat-o-burrito? Greatest satirical NDT quote of all time Do you be like it is doh? it do No it's GTA. C- Apply yourself. You can hike all day without running into one of these! What a score!  > All you had to do was follow the damn 'Lorean!

FTFY ~~Why was that mission so difficult like God damn~~

Why was that mission so difficult like **GREAT SCOTT!** Big Smoke was dumb as shit and couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat, so not only did you have to drive a fairly difficult route, you had to shoot a metric fuck-ton of bad guys who apparently could outsoot Chris fucking Kyle.  trick is to keep more distance from the train, really fucking easy then. didn't know that either back in the day. What I find really funny is that is nowhere near the hardest mission on GTA:SA (well, the hardest one you need to complete the game).  That award goes to motherfucking Supply Lines which Rockstar actually had to patch in later releases.  It took me over 50 attempts to beat it and I only did by the skin of my teeth. The trick is boarding the top of the train with the bike and killing them yourself. I'm pretty sure I did it on the first try because you have to be beside the  train but behind all the gang members to line the shot up, its also way easier on a console than a pc I believe the original title of the show was "Doc and Mharti", this was back when the running gag was Doc forcing Mharti to lick his balls. rewatching bttf recently and the inspiration is obvious. 

'Terrorist Marty, Libyan terrorists' 

 'awww geeze doc, why, why is this happening' 

 'my uranium marty, they are after the uranium'  

'wh wh what the hell are you doing with uranium??'

'i COULD EXPLAIN, BUT IT IS TIME TO RUN MORTY, OR THEY ARE GONNA KILL US' Also, Rick 'n' Morty kindof sounds like 'rigamortis'  
*Coincidence?!!?!??* Morty *is* a parody of Marty. Doc! The Libyans are back, they say they'll let us go if you give them the recipe for concentrated dark matter! And no better place.  That's not actually Neebs. It's Appsro﻿. Saints rows I wanna say futurama. The DLC is so expensive because otherwise people wouldn't have an incentive to go and buy some Shark Cards. Downloadable content content That's sort of the point though, at least for the bigger stuff.

Not everyone should be able to afford a business or a yacht. 

Some cars and clothes are a bit over priced though, but then again we do have multiple ways of making big bucks now. Because OP has like 5 frames.  Difference between the gifv and regular gif format. Gifv is a WebM or MP4 video set to work normally like a gif, but with increased quality and generally quicker load times because the files are much smaller (in most cases). Looks like he did the simple thing that everyone should do and used www.imgur.com/vidgif  Is it? Wassup!!!!  Glad people are sharing the vid! CJ, YOU BUTTHEAD Rage Cop where the gif takes place:

That, the build quality was literal shit, as in they had a second factory in LA to rebuild the brand new cars. And people wonder why Ireland had no manufacturers. Another was the stainless steel was over fiberglass, so the car was really heavy, Doc. Fffuuuu--

I hardly ever got to pick out a game when I was little, and when I finally did get the rare opportunity to pick and buy a game, I would always be excited as fuck to get back home. Now imagine my disappointment when I popped this steaming piece of shit game cartridge into my NES after being such a huge fan of the movies. That AVGN video sums it up perfectly.
 This is the one I was thinking of too. Gah. Nightmares from my childhood.  I was expecting [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f_8VOFivXM). Yess me too haha. I still have this game. ***Jesus Christ: Back to the Future: Revenge of the Crucified: Easter Bunny Madness***

A Meorge Giblucas Creation. *Crucified Edition* with DLC It would have the potential to be super layered and complex for sure.  The only thing I can envision is that you travel travel between the different time periods, the 1880's, 1950's, 1980's and 2010's I guess.

And somehow everything you change in the past is carried over into every future world?

Imagine the processing power that would require! I wouldn't say they're bad, but they really do churn these out. Hey now, a lot of /r/interactivecinema games are masterpieces. The Wolf Among Us is just god damned beautiful to be honest. But that one is like a fresh peanut butter and honey sandwich. The others are more like gas station tuna sandwiches. They aren't all bad, Telltale just keeps churning them out again and again with the same kind of nerd-favorite franchises.  If anything they are more stale than anything. https://taleoftwowastelands.com/ Tale of Two Wastelands mod

https://taleoftwowastelands.com/ I'm playing Seasons right now and thoroughly enjoying it. I love the top down Zelda games so much.  Thank you for reminding me of this game.

I had no idea what to do when I got to the first town. I only realized just now that you could push one of the characters listening to the lady sing to progress in the story...

I have had this game for over 13 years and can finally continue..

 I am borderline crying right now, I never beat Seasons.  Chrono Trigger pretty much preceded all the other ones mentioned here. If anything we just need a GTA VI with more Mexico. Also it doesn't seem too far-fetched for Los Santos to be a front in, say, the Mexican-American war. After all most of the current American West coast belonged to the Mexican Empire at that point.

This is currently in developement, and its being made by the creator of Monkey Island 1&2 There are still some solid games out there. Maybe not to the level of the Lucas Arts games, but Broken Sword and Dreamfall/Longest Journey are all pretty solid. Check out adventuregamers.com for some little known games that don't have the press but aren't half bad.  Same here, I'm having a blast replaying the old Simon the Sorceror games on my phone. Not quite as brilliant as Guybrush but very entertaining and I forgotten all the puzzles since its been 20 years!  there was this upcoming sci fi point and click adventure game with beautiful sprite animations, several different times or dimensions converging, it looked really awesome, I think it was on kickstarter but can't seem to find it.. There is a new kings quest, that's pretty point 'n' click if you're into click & point adventures, you could give some of [these company's games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalic_Entertainment) a try. Check out the Deponia games on Steam,  very reminiscent of Space Quest and Monkey Island. 

Also,  Tales From the Borderlands  You should check out Day9's Mostly Walking series. They played DotT a couple of months ago.  https://thimbleweedpark.com/
 Did you ever try Broken Age? I played through half of it and loved it, despite it being a huge departure from the type of games I normally play.  I just made a post yesterday in regards to games being so instant gratification now. It was on the subject of Elder Scrolls Online level-scaling all content  so a lvl 1 could go anywhere in the game, which is ridiculous to me.  I was stuck for weeks on the OoT Water temple, felt great finally beating it.  it's neater than most neat things! It's an Oscar Gamble quote... I be. You can tell it's GTA by the way it is. Well that's pretty neat. GTA, apply directly to the forehead.  Because there is a problem with the earth's gravitational pull. i always wondered who scott was and why is he so great?  Didn't CJ say that to Smoke one time? That he couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat? Regardless of how you do it, Big Smoke is a fucking terrible shot. The scene where you find out he's betraying you had no effect on me because I already hated that dude. What I did was just drive on top of the train and kill them myself Was that the one with the rc planes?  You had to wear nothing but cutoffs and blue body paint IRL to beat it. yea that was no joke Its really easy if you get a decent seed for their "random" paths they take, and have enough practice with the plane. Its just because its realistically the first time non standard controls are available to you that its hard. The fucking flying missions were a bitch too. I saw a speed runner do this and it changed my life.  That was one of those weird missions where I got it on the first try, but every other time though it took like an hour. [Link for those who are curious of Rick and Morty's not-so-humble origins](https://youtu.be/EbTlK3perdI) [NSFW] Yeah well maybe if Mharti didn't get his damn kite stuck in the tree, he wouldn't have to lick balls Lick, lick, lick my balls! Haha, yeah, say that all the time! I want to re-write the BTTF script but in R&M format. and kinda like brick and mortar, since they're the foundation of the show Right, but Neebs still sounds like Rusty. That sounds right but I think it's Saints Row OP's also doesn't let you look around when the car gets back in time. It is! Love seeing you guys get the spotlight! It was a great rage cop, we need more Simon though.

P.s. Also tell Anthony I'm sorry for ripping him so hard on his BF1 let's play video. Keep up the great work! Your guys' content is only getting better  Definitely the best rage cop to date I love Rage Cop! Favorite GTA machinima series ever! KISSES :-* I think he meant the link to the video that was quoted. Awesome video! 2nd video I've seen from this guy today. Think it's a sign to sub.  Literal shit? Cartridge days...  
They really hurried those damn movie-to-game titles knowing the title alone would sell.  A funny relationship back then... and  successful film made for a worse videogame because of that.     Now I want a good Flash game where you can just fuck the timeline as much as you want. Forget processing power, think about the man power to build out all those different time periods - they'd basically have to build assets for 4 different games lol Which is why it's just a hypothetical game you buzzkill I laughed when I saw the Minecraft Telltale game. I don't know, I think Tales from Borderlands is the best game they've made. Wolf Among Us and S1 The Walking Dead and Tales were the only good ones. They're churning out shitty ones now. Minecraft? Batman? I'd recommend playing Ages as well if you haven't yet. Their stories connect in some cool ways.  OMG that's so much bank robbing potential... Get on it man! Even the shittiest of computers can run Gameboy emulators. And if you don't have a computer but have an Android phone, you can download free emulators and different sites have free ROMs. Broken Age was a lot of fun, too. Although, I just downloaded SCUMMVM the other day and I'm playing through Fate of Atlantis for the 50th time over the last 20 years.  Double edged sword there though. 

Places like that are where you find those perfect games that balance everything just right. Then you get mad because you can never get it back and it can never be recreated just the same again. 

 also telltale games are pretty sweet, pretty much similar vein? Man I'm stuck in the goblin prison and struggling to figure it out  I haven't heard of that Daedalic before but they have an impressive list of published games. I don't think theres one game on there (that I've played) that I didn't enjoy I've not even touched ES online due to the reviews. I've got 500+ hours on Skyrim and I don't want any part of ES online incase it ruins my experience. Exactly why I refuse to watch Terminator 3 or Indiana Jones 4 lol Was that the bit in the Jungle? If so, yes I agree, that was a brain melt. Not as hard as the court case with the leg lamp (can't remember the exact details - long time ago) ... I got through that due to complete luck. http://i.imgur.com/W9O3DDo.jpg Everyone forgets that it came from a baseball player, and just assumes it was born in a meme. That's heavy, doc. He just really loves the office. I think it was the other guy. Rida? Rider?  Idk but I thought the same thing.  Maybe? I don't remember if he did. It's a fairly common saying, so he could have.  If he did it'd be worded more like "yo fat ass couldn't hit water if you fell outta damn boat." I've done it a few times since, if you keep a good distance smoke can easily shoot them all before you even go through the first tunnel out of los santos. He keeps hitting the train if you're too close to it. It's not him being a terrible shot. What you don't realize is that in the scene where you come to your house and Big Smoke comes running at you with a bat hinkign you're a burglar is that he swung like, five times at you and completely whiffed. Smokin Ryder was one of the best moments of my gaming career. " I'll have two number 9's, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45's, one with cheese, and a large soda." 

- Big Smoke IIRC, yes.  Thats the most frustrating missions I remember from GTA:SA.  Yes, also, I was recently playing GTA : SA on my PC again, and I realized how difficult that is, like why couldn't I just kill them on a motorcycle? It would have the same affect and be twice as fast. I didn't buy that building so you and your enemy can do toy planes. On the other hand I hated that fucking mission where you break into an army storage area and have to use that fucking forklift.  Train>Forklift the most realistic thing in that video are ricks balls Just a heads-up, folks, this one is really NSFW but funny as hell. holy shit is that where Rick's "Lick, lick, lick my balls... Haha yeah I say that all the time!" comes from? How the hell is that allowed on YouTube? He has to jerk him off, too. I want a complete re-dub done by Justin Roiland ad libbing And also like dick'a'whorey which also has an uncanny resemblance of..things.

EDIT: dick and ball'y goes better :/ Fair enough. You are correct. Don't know why I hear benders voice, when I read that.  Is it? Shit, lemme fix that quick. Yeah man, ain't easy welding feces together  In this case, the movie came out in 1985 and the game in 1989....no excuse! And then work out dynamically how the past worlds would affect the future worlds, and make all the assets for that.

Sounds really fucking cool, but not very practical. I dream that one day my grandchildren will have VR for games like that. Yeah, I'm definitely going to play ages when I finish seasons! Thanks for the recommendation though.  I just played Oracle of Ages... in what aspects do they connect? 


And what happened when you used the code at the end of one game on the other? But then the shop owner electrocutes you the next time and you get a permanent name change Rob the bank in the future, buy the bank in the past. Time traveller's infinite money glitch. also gemeni rue was fun, and shardlight and automaticity look great The Court with lamps was the killer.  It makes me sad. It's one of the best baseball quotes ever. There's that word again, "heavy." So was Big Smoke [Ryder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DSg7zDsyOcY/hqdefault.jpg) It's you being a terrible drive-by pilot making the shooter not having the right angle to the target. Especially since Ryder couldn't keep the army guys off of himself, I had to run them over in the forklift. The most realistic thing about the entire universe is Rick's balls Ohhhhhhhhh yeah, lemme tag that. Thanks. Yes That was my first question. It's art M-mharti *gets to. and also like sick and forty because i'm old and gross. I hear bender too... Hmm, BTTF 2 was 1989, maybe that is was spawned the game? Sounds more than practical to me.  Most of GTA and sandbox games are full of buildings you can't enter and reused assets anyway.  AAA developers have set the bar really low for what to expect from games given how much money they bring in.  

Chrono Trigger did this on the Super Nintendo 20+ years ago, multiple timelines and things you do in the past affecting the future worlds. You'll get a special password at the end of the game. When creating a new save in the second game you have an option "secret". Fill in the password from the first and the new save will have the same name, an extra heart and your companion is the same. Choices made in the first game might come back as reference in the second and you'll get the true ending.

Tldr.. worth it! Sorta like a new game plus..You get an extra boss at the end and hidden items? I haven't played in years so I can't exactly remember.  [Mark Brown explains it nicely](https://youtu.be/fqKGl6exyyY). I recommend watching his other videos too. Ahh the finer points of gangland drive by shootings. Doesn't he also keep yelling at you to get closer to the train? You can find pornography on YouTube if you search long enough so who cares. I like the cut of your jib.  Nah, there's a BTTF 2/3 game, as well. He mentions all of this in the video. Yeah, I think you needed items from one version to unlock secrets in the other. Both games were really cool, though. I don't remember which one I liked more. You need to eat well to pull them off. I suggest two number 9's, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45's; one with cheese, and a large soda.

Shit, he probably betrayed you to pay his debt to cluckin' bell. Makes me miss the good 'ol days. Yeah but it's more get closer to the 1st car not glued to IT, or at least you would think so since being anything closer than the 2nd rail(from left to right) of the incoming train tracks you're too close for a good shot at the mexicans... Or do something like work or sleep while autoplay does its magic and you come back later to see what weird side of YouTube rngesus landed you on. r/nocontext Let's hope he also taught her how to swim. I don't want to go underwater to get a raft.  They made this for SNES too? Ellie: "Swear to me that everything that you said about the fireflies is true."
Joel: "I swear. Anyway, here's Wonderwall." But did he teach her how to swim? That's the real question. I think the following line is:

"Yeah, I think you'd like that"

I loved that part. NSFW because....  Fuck. This just makes me truly believe that Joel is dead in Part II. If Joel dies, I better damn well be able to X for JOOOOEEEL This was the #1 thing I walked away from that trailer with. An excellent touch. That screenshot looks like utter shit. :( Joel better not be fucking dead The first thing i thought after the hype settled down in my brain, directly followed by 'My GOD it must be a pain in the arse to find new strings.' Why does this look like a GameCube port? Joel better not be dead. There have been so many shows and games where the twist was "OMG, he's been dead the whole time!" All of these "Joel is dead" theories are unfounded.  *edit* MOST Characters aren't killed off-screen.  They may kill him at the start of the game, or in some flash back.  

*edit*

I would like to add that killing off one of two main characters in an IP that has seen tremendous success makes very little sense.  I don't think Naughty Dog is into pissing off their fans.  And uh, JOEL WAS IN THE TRAILER. Can someone explain the significance of this and the NSFW tag? Wow I'm really happy i didnt get to play it till the remastered version  I struggled to get into the game. Not because it was a shitty story. Not because it was boring. Not because it was too difficult. 

I struggled to get into the game because as soon as one of those mushroom zombies came chasing towards me, I'd lose my shit and immediately quit the game. 

I'm glad I mustered up some courage and got passed the first few mushroom encounters because between this and the Unchartered series, it's hard to find games of this quality.  Why in the fuck is this marked nsfw?  Putting a vague title for a post containing spoilers... but not including what game is being talked about?? Can we not do this?  HE 👏 TAUGHT 👏 HER 👏  TO 👏 PLAY 👏 GUITAR 👏 WHEN 👏 NO 👏 ONE 👏 ELSE 👏 WOULD I guess they aren't "done" though. Either I'm forgetting what it looked like on PS3 and it actually looked this blurry, or the pic itself is blurrier than usual. What is wrong with the graphics? This looks like it's from the 90's. Saying it's a spoiler without saying which game you are potentially spoiling kind of defeats the purpose.

That said this is barely a spoiler so it's not a huge issue Man, I can't wait for TLOU2 :') Nice catch. I'm cautiously optimistic about this, now. 

I really felt the game had a perfect ending, and no sequel was needed. Finding out they not only made a sequel but it's the same characters worried me.   Some long nights on the internet have led me to expect something different from a NSFW TLoU link. He kept his promise quite a while back. Did no one see the live performance they did? Troy and Ashley acted out a whole scene from after the game where he plays guitar and starts teaching her. "...and kill people, why not?" Didn't we already get this at the end of the original game with her already playing guitar?  Never played this game. What am I looking at? I don't think he's dead. I think Ellie must have heard about Marlene and is pissed. 
Joel didn't tell her the truth and she thinks it's the fireflies that killed her. In mutiny or something. 

People forget that Marlene was basically her aunt.  literally finished my second playthrough on Sunday and noticed this same thing Fuuuck, the feels Whoa! That's deepest lore.

Also, why is this NSFW?
 Damn how did you get such a bad screenshot of such a beautiful game? Joel is going to turn, calling it now. Why is this NSFW?  Why is this NSFW?? Why is this NSFW? Dumb question, why is this marked NSFW? why is this nsfw? datsa lot of upvotes Why I have this feeling that they gonna kill Joe in this game ending I don't want that :(  Game?  /r/TheLastofUs I'm not a big gamer, so I find it very weird that people in the audience at these things get so crazy excited. Feels like some guys literally crap their pants when Ellie showed up. Is it really that big of a deal? I'm not crying you're crying  Bruhhhhhhhh I don't remember the graphics being this bad, I remember it being beautiful. Wth  What if she taught herself? You know I played all the way through the last of us, but I don't particularly remember the ending...It must not have been very impactful. I'm so ready for the feels train in part 2. The Last of Us will always hold a very special place in my heart as a gamer. The connections and character building in the first game was just amazing to me. Thank god for that spoiler tag this picture gives away the entire plot basically. What's nsfw about this? Mmmmm these graphics are awesome! Why is this considered NSFW? $5 says theres gonna be a fucking guitar qte or some shit

 Is that how shit the graphics are? I used to think they were amazing  I forgot how bad the PS3 looked If this comes to pc in any way shape or form, my life will be so utterly complete. Wow. What an awesome small tie in! Good guy Joel :Keeps promises 
Bad Guy Joel: hides the dark dark truth from ellie If it's over, it's gonna be a boring game.(IE: It ain't over) Woah. I literally just watched this exchange on my second replay. Man joel is so dead in part 2 isn't he  We just need Joel to keep his promise that Ellie made for him. We need an Ellie and Joel duet.   This was seriously my first thought after I saw the firefly logo and the gutiar. Had to count while she played! Holy shit this totally hit a cord, no pun intended. Spoiler! My guess from reading all the comments is that Joel will be presumed dead, like she sees him go down under a mountain of zombies or there's a big explosion or something, but at the end they're reunited and they get to play guitar together.

Haven't played the first game so I don't know much. Better continuity than the whole of the xmen franchise. I was watching the trailer with a friend when it was announced. As soon as I realized Ellie was playing the guitar I was all "Oh shit Joel said he would teach Ellie to play guitar and he did." Teach her how to love DUCK!  Why I am so excited?  I don't even own a damn PS4! Oh my Lord, those textures are ghastly *cries instantly* I don't get this. I can't wait for Last of Us 2, I think I'll actually buy a PS4 for it.  However I was playing the original and found myself not wanting to the fight the fireflies at the end, knowing the outcome.  Why can't I find that Office Space gif when I need it... This should be NSFL Holy shit :') I don't think Joel's dead. There's already a franchise about revenge for dead family it's called god of war and while the plot might be about more than that, it still is too much of an unoriginal idea. IIRC, the extra epilogue scene they did at the live performance featured her playing guitar too. can some1 explain the joke to me Woah, this game is for PS2? Father of the Year! First thing that came to mind when I started up the trailer.  Well you play as Ellie so you won't have to. That "mission" was hell. I hated the way the trains were  You know what's bothered me about Ellie? She knows how to kill people, hunt for food, shoot a gun, and stitch up a wound, but one of the most necessary and basic survival skills, swimming, is completely unknown to her. Im actually genuinely confused as to how this looks so shitty. did op screen record this from some shitty 240p TV or something? I mean I forget that the ps3 is old enough to have had standard component hookups with the standard ps video output cable.  Needs more JoelPEG There seems to be a trend of really low-quality screenshots lately. And I don't just mean compression artefacts. The lighting, the low-res textures, low-poly models, low-effort foliage. I swear this game didn't look this shitty.

This is beyond potato. This is lemon-battery powering a defibrillator shocking the heart of a ventricular fibrillating asthmatic mouse whose EKG and breaths are interpreted, poorly, as levels that represent brightness and contrast, respectively, then processed by a broken Zotac GPU missing its cooling fan and forgotten in a running microwave then transmitted to a VHF transmitter over a 200-foot VGA cable and received by a pair of misaligned bunny ears connected at one pole only to a forgotten RCA CRT TV with fake wood panelling then viewed through the frosted glass of the closed armoire doors in a brightly-lit room by an octogenarian who really isn't interested and still believes that television is just a fad that is destined to die off and be replaced by Dan Brown novels.

Edit: ouch. [Yeah, and for the NES as well.](http://imgur.com/a/gLs1I) What's that meme about guitars and wonderwall? "Yeah, I think you'd like that you fucking retard"

FTFY Holy shit man! This past week after the announcement of the new game has brought back so much nostalgia for this game. Man it definitely had the best dialogue of any game I've ever played. Right in the ducking feels. Because he showed her how to finger A Minor

Edit: Thank you for thy gold!! Spoiler. Or something. He probably is,  his exact words sounded way too passive too, like he can't do anything about what Ellie is doing:
 what are you doing kiddo?  You really gonna go through with this? 

 Why are people jumping on this theory so quickly? Part I was too **grounded** (it was even the name of the game's ultimate difficulty setting) for Part II to be *Ellie's Sixth Sense*. Might Joel die over the course of the game? Sure. Is he going to be a full body apparition that follows her around and supports/guides her until some awful what-a-twist reveal? Honestly that feels insulting to Naughty Dog's proven quality track record. I trust Druckmann. You shut your whore mouth!  I feel that not seeing Joel head on (only silhouetted) makes him feel almost detached. I'm not gonna jump to conclusions but I feel Joel's centralising protagonist position as seen in number 1 will get replaced by Ellie. [deleted] You watched the announcement trailer did you?
 They're gonna kill him in the first scene, same way the first one played out. That's a good point. It does look like he materializes out of the light from the doorway in the PSX trailer.  Or Sully comes in and says "JOEL!!! NOOOOOOOOOO" F Dicks out for Joel My money is on we have him for part of the game, but he dies pretty early on.  I was thinking that while watching; well that and "Wow they did a good job on those hands." People always say stuff like this, but if you saw this screenshot when GameCube was current, you'd totally shit. Pardon my ignorance, but besides Sixth Sense, who else has done that? Exactly.  Considering how impactful the first game made every character death, they wouldn't just open the 2nd with "btw he dead." My take is that Ellie argued with Joel about whatever she's killing these guys for and ran off to do so. Joel eventually catches up to her and sees the carnage. Realizing that she's gonna do this no matter what he asks her "are you really gonna go through with this?" Yeah at the most, they kill Joel off in a 20 minute preface to the game like they did in the original with his daughter Oh yeah, especially since Naughty Dog is one of the few companies that like to keep characters around. Characters are ABSOLUTELY killed "off screen" in all forms of media.  > I would like to add that killing off one of two main characters in an IP that has seen tremendous success makes very little sense

Yeah, but they have kind of said themselves they didn't want to be stuck doing only Joel+Ellie stuff.             
This may have been a lie, but I can believe they'll introduce different characters now and kill off/end the story of the older ones.

It still makes sense, not everyone is a greedy cunt that doesn't know when to end a story in a good manner. Joel promises to teach Ellie guitar towards the end of The Last of Us. The new trailer for Part II shows her playing guitar, which means he kept his word. It's just a cool bit of continuity. The NSFW tag is to hide spoilers but it's useless anyway because OP didn't include the name of the game in the title.  The game was pretty scary but the scariest part imo was when you had to keep resetting the generator in the basement of that building. it was a pretty frightening game at times, i can see how it'd be tough to play through. Oh man, I uninstalled "Amnesia" after getting to a specific point. I understand. Pro tip: passed ≠ past I'm playing through it for the first time now and I've decided I hate the scavenging aspect. Hate having to check every inch of every room for supplies. Game is great otherwise.  So this is a zombie game. Finally, a clue. oh cmon clickers are the fun ones. they cant see you so you get to line up the headshots easy on them..or just make a bunch of molotovs on normal difficulty..throw a brick or glass bottle then toss a molotov. 

you should play on the harder difficulty settings..those are fun..no "radar" plus way fewer resources..a lot more running away lol good times.

i cant wait for TLOU 2 People usually mark their posts as NSFW so that there thumbnail is hidden, to hide any spoilers in it. In this case, it's pretty fucking useless considering OP didn't put the name of the game in the title so it would be spoiled anyway once you clicked not knowing what game the post will be. I'm fairly certain it is The Last of Us, however I don't get the reference either. I have a PS3 hooked up to a TV with 720 resolution and it looks *way* better than this. TLOU:P2

FTFY If it sucks, it doesn't take anything away from the first game. I beat The Last of Us for the first time yesterday, and I absolutely loved it. I'd like to see the story continued because we didn't get an end. 

Ellie was going to find out sooner or later that Joel lied. I mean, they went back to the dam with Tommy, and Tommy is an ex Firefly that has to have some old ties to the organization. The ending we got was a bubble. It was the end of Joel's story because Joel had found something to live for after he'd been in survival mode forever. He got a life back for a minute. It was nowhere close to the end of Ellie's story, though. And she never got a choice in her life.  Marlene was like Ellie's aunt, but I honestly think that Joel is more important to her. They're basically a father and daughter by the end of the game, Joel even calls Ellie his baby girl and she trusts him so much that even when he lies to her about the fireflies, she's on the verge of tears, but is willing to go along with the lie because she trusts that he made the right call.

>posts jpg

 tell us how you really feel I'm not sure it's still relevant. Anyway, it's here: 

[https://www.knowingyourmeme.com/s?q=Wonderwall+Guitar/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) Wonderwall is the song every guy playing guitar on the grass in the middle of a college campus knows.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAmiaSfKVE The little optional dialogues hammered in the notion that these were actual people with real personalities. Some of them were funny as hell, some were just really sad or, i dunno.. they made you think. While using a G String. My first time giving gold...ever. That was really genius  Fucking lol goddamnit I just bursted out in laughter at work.  This is a high quality pun. Damn how have I never heard this. Definitely beats the "thumb a mean G string" I'm used to Bravo. Which isn't really very useful: spoiler for which game? that is the worst attempted spoiler tag... i'm willing to bet that the majority of people will be more likely to click a link with NSFW on it, and very few will realize it's actually a spoiler warning before even opening the link. If he's  a ghost why does he have a gun? Maybe they're hiding some horrifc scar or something else? Why does it gotta be ghosts?

This theory is fun, but i'm willing to bet it will be shelved along with Mass Effect's Indoctrination Theory and MGSV's Chico/Queit theories and other crazy nonsense Reddit thinks up and tries to will into existence.

EDIT: Ghost, Hallucination, same shit in my book. I don't think Joel's dead. Well if he is alive he's probably pushing 60 at this point. No way he could still run around kicking ass like he did in the first game. Especially when you consider the physical toll of doing nothing but surviving, getting hit/shot/stabbed for 20 years has to take on your body. He probably couldn't stop Ellie if he tried. And the fact that we can't see his face. He almost appear like a fantomatic figure in that trailer. Or that she's 19 and he can't really tell her what to do. She's free to make her own decisions. Are you sure you want to go through with this, Dexter? I was thinking more of mental breakdown by ellie and starts seeing Joel where ever she goes ~~The Last of us~~ Beyond: Two Souls: 2 I think people are looking too much into this trailer. Do I think its possible that joel will die? Yes. I doubt he will be dead from the start but I suppose its possible. A lot of cg trailers for games are conceptual and not canon. that much has already been confirmed.  Ellie is the main character in part 2.  They confirmed that Ellie is the lead playable character while Joel is the secondary one, a reverse of the first game. But that doesn't mean he's dead. How cliche.  Yes, but the fact that joel's face was not shown directly, and that he walks into the house after she's been sitting there for a while, is leading a lot of people to think he died, and she's still continuing, but she's slightly delusional and hallucinates him talking to her all the time.  Of course fucking Sully would survive the apocalypse.

Probably just back from banging a few clicker barmaids in Lima. L Not another Sarah incident... The first time is bad enough. :( If he does die, I hope you see him die, but the entire game is going back in time to recap the events leading to it, so you get all your heartstrings tickled then cry the saddest of tears. I'm sure I'd shit seeing someone tie a buggie to a horse in whatever year, but I'd still want to take a car in 2016 On top of my head for the whole "not really there" thing:

Call of Duty [Reznov](/spoiler)

For that hacker show [The dad](/spoiler)

Fight Club [The friend](/spoiler) Who says the trailer is from the beginning of the game? Could be in the middle or towards the end. I don't think anyone is implying that's what they would do. 

You'd probably start playing the game with Ellie and Joel alive and towards the middle/end there's a flashback showing his death and you realize Ellie's been alone all that time. Perfectly possible if they avoid showing Joel communicating with other people. Additional, why the fuck would you kill a character that is at the head of one of the most beloved games in the last decade?  It's dumb. It honestly barely sounds like his voice in my opinion. Sounds like a voice actor with a higher voice.  Seems to me this is the most plausible. Reddit and other sites with fandoms just love jerking themselves with convoluted and twisting twists that would put Shyamalan to shame (funnily enough, with a similar idea from one of his movies). I guess it's normal though, since we as spectators have to work with very little time and material to speculate. Also, let's be honest, the theories don't come from someone or a team of people sitting dozens of hours thinking, scratching, analysing, etc the theories they come up with. Woah man, that's not true. His daughter just went to live with her mother on a farm in northern oklahoma. 

:*(  Sometimes I think about replaying this game a 3rd time but I always remember that feeling I got when you fall into the basement. When you see the silhouette of a zombie run across the hallway... Jesus.  The game wasn't really scary to me other than that part.  The dark watery basement in the hotel, had clickers and those bloater guys down there... definitely scariest part in the game. Agreed. It's one of the few times in 30 years of gaming where I got actual anxiety having to play through a section. Fuck that part. Once it got going I just grabbed the key card and ran to the door. The bloater managed to get a spore bomb off, but I still got through the door with like six of them chasing me.  Once I figured out to reset it then run upstairs it was much easier. OMG seriously...zombies freak me out...that level killed me. Great game though, one of my top 5 :) This is where I stopped playing in my play through. Still haven't got passed it. Need to start a new game.  This was stupidly fucking difficult on Grounded. The rest of the game was moderately difficult and tense, but man... fuck that basement! I found most stuff cool instead of scary, cept for the generator level. That shit was off the chain! It still baffles me how people are ballsy enough to even INSTALL the game. Or any horror game for that matter. Im such a wuss when it comes to horror games Pro tip: passed = D or higher Fun? You think we played TLoU because it was fun? Fuck that. Beat the game, immediately jump to Grounded difficulty, and learn how to hate yourself in ways you didn't think possible.  Watch the last of us 2 teaser  TLOU2:P2:EB I guess I felt it ended her story as well. 

Ellie trusted Joel. She woke up after the climax of the game. Joel said it didn't work.  She was still groggy and this man who had saved her a dozen times before had her safe on the back seat of a truck traveling. She took him at his word and tried to recover from what I imagine was a splitting headache. 

But as they got closer to "home" little things in her head didn't add up. She thought about it over and over. Little inconsistencies rattling around in her head. "Why don't I remember anything? Why didn't they wake me up? Why couldn't they find a cure after all that? I still haven't turned, this bite is basically healed at this point. Why couldn't they do anything with that information?" She finally confronted Joel. 

And this man, Joel. This man she trusted, she saved, she spent an entire year with lied to her face without hesitation. 

Her face said it all:  She's alone.  It doesn't matter the details, what happens when they get back, when she inevitably finds out the truth (it will always come out) 

She either is going to have to live a convenient lie, or face a horrendous truth.  

All her teenage mind can muster to say as a reaction to this flood of emotions and logical conclusions is "O.K."

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VoZeHxRZmTU/maxresdefault.jpg

That was my take on it, anyway. And why I'm not exactly thrilled for a sequel.  Joel is definitely more important to her. I'm not disputing that. I just think some people have jumped to conclusions. 
Someone mentioned how Joel seemed to 'materialise' in the trailer suggesting he's a ghost. 
I'm like, it's a trailer, it's supposed to be mysterious. Plus he was in direct sunlight.  Good game. Quick Time Event. Quick Time Event, basically a prompt shows up on the screen to press a button to continue the action. It means cutie and it's when the game gets really cute and makes you press specific buttons in a small time frame in a pass/fail kind of way. Kinda like in Resident Evil 4 where a monster would kill you if you didnt press A when it tells you to press A.

Qte actually means quick time event Maybe, but wouldn't you see the edges of the tv? And if it was close enough to not see those edges you'd definitely see the pixels on the tv.  http://www.gamepur.com/news/25215-last-us-part-ii-story-counter-first-game-its-about-hate-says-neil-druckmann.html

its said in the 4th paragraph Can't remember where I heard it, but I heard it somewhere. Will find and get back to you on that  Naughty Dog's panel at PSX http://www.technobuffalo.com/2016/12/06/you-play-as-ellie-in-the-last-of-us-2/ Crazy to me that any parents wouldn't teach their kids to swim. Also crazier that all kids aren't taught by default  that might make sense. the textures on those cars look way worse than that game should look even at "standard definition" quality.  This is my favorite comment I've seen get gold in a long time for some reason. Love how the reply gets gilded instead of the trying-too-hard comment above. Pretty sure that he typed more characters than the image has pixels.  > Edit #2: 😂 the /r/lounge sub is a joke, I didn't think I could be disappointed when I had no expectations.

When you get 100k karma you can join /r/centuryclub.  It is better. Yeah. I've been there. Never really sure what it was supposed to be. Man, I want gold just so I could go in and be disappointed with you. Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I laughed to tears reading that.  Ok.  There seems to be a trend of really low-quality screenshots lately. And I don't just mean compression artefacts. The lighting, the low-res textures, low-poly models, low-effort foliage. I swear this game didn't look this shitty.
This is beyond potato. This is lemon-battery powering a defibrillator shocking the heart of a ventricular fibrillating asthmatic mouse whose EKG and breaths are interpreted, poorly, as levels that represent brightness and contrast, respectively, then processed by a broken Zotac GPU missing its cooling fan and forgotten in a running microwave then transmitted to a VHF transmitter over a 200-foot VGA cable and received by a pair of misaligned bunny ears connected at one pole only to a forgotten RCA CRT TV with fake wood panelling then viewed through the frosted glass of the closed armoire doors in a brightly-lit room by an octogenarian who really isn't interested and still believes that television is just a fad that is destined to die off and be replaced by Dan Brown novels. I feel like people on Reddit take things too seriously. There's a not-insignificant number of comments about "trying too hard". Garner criticisms of "trying too hard" and thesaurus hunting because the comment contained a six-syllable word? You seem to get it. It's just another rendition of a comedy trope. It doesn't claim to be poetry or Shakespeare. But that's enough about me.

How are you? Saw the XcQ, clicked it anyways....

What has this site done to me [Well, I guess I'm immune.](https://i.imgur.com/rBYd44V.png
) I just found this dude the other day on YT. Neat to see him here. Dude actually has some talent.  It was me who gave gold man! The Last of Us: Part 2. It's spoilers for the fact that Ellie lives through TLOU part 1, which for a good chunk of the story it looks like she will not. Promise? To this day, I choose to believe the Indoctrination theory is canon.  Why does Tyler Durden need sunglasses?  It's part of his character, whether real or imaginary Joel would be expected to carry a gun most of the time

Edit: when people say ghost they mean in her mind not like a supernatural literal spooky ghost

Edit 2: I'm not saying I believe the theory or that I want it to be true just that if it was true it makes sense since a young girl brutally killing people probably would be fucked up mentally Uh, no one is saying it's literally a ghost. Just her imagination while she's processing what's going on. The "ghost" is for the video gamer to watch a story. What is the indoctrination theory?  Doubt it's ghost ghosts, maybe she's hallucinating it but I doubt we're going ghosts  Also, why would she imagine him walking in from outside where she can't see or hear him? Could be to make the audience first think Ellie is in danger as the person approaches, before pulling the shot back to reveal Joel. Joel isn't dead.



Joel will die, but he's not dead. There's no reason to think he is dead other than the shadow. If anything, that look Ellie gives him is one of "I know what you did". Not "I'm gonna avenge you".



But that's just my theory. Don't forget Darth Jar Jar, the most powerful sith Lord the galaxy has ever known 😆😂 It's very Harry Morgan from Dexter the way he looks. Completely as she remembers him, maybe a little better. A strong father figure, holding a rifle, ready to protect her. 

It may very well be that he knows he's too old to go with her and so he's making sure she knows he won't be taking part. I find that a little harder to believe, though. Old man strength. There is a gif of Santa Claus squatting 500lbs on the front page right now. Or he's become a poor-man's Wolverine. His body is riddled with metal and scar-tissue. Old Man Joel! Let's be fair, the Hulk couldn't stop Ellie is she wanted to do something. She'd just whistle and throw bricks at him repeatedly till he gave up.  Obi-Joel Kenobi.  You get to play as Joel in flashbacks where Tommy's town is getting attacked in the night by Fireflies. He isn't dead.  It would be a thematic departure for the series to have ghost characters and psychological illusions.  The first game was very grounded in reality and Joel and Ellie were seeped in it.  The whole reason they stayed alive was because they accepted the world they lived in and chose to survive alone without emotional attachments.  It wouldnt be consistent with the character of Ellie to have her seeing ghosts. Doubt it, but nice theory. Characters don't die off screen.  They'd need to kill him right away in part II.   Right after he brought a bloater to church  *If* it happens (I'm in dennial) I guess it would be something like Tess in the first game. I've started watching the game in [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkLPKd-Vs8g) (played it a couple of years ago) with my wife who has no interest in video games. She cried so hard when Sarah died we had to take a break. I sure hope he gets past the tutorial, Sarah is weak for not making further than that tbh. Do you smell toast? eh having the main character die and then reappear a few scenes later as a ghost/hallucination would be a bit weird imo That would be my mind fuck then.
I would never let Joel talk to people, so everyone hyped by that theory is paying a lot attention to this and is like "See he NEVER interacts with anyone except Ellie" and then in the last scenes he finally interacts with others. Shock value and to show the character who killed him is significant. Different situation, but GTA V did it with Trevor killing Johnny. have you not watched game of thrones? i would be shocked if we didn't start seeing more main characters being slaughtered.  Rip Soap McTavish  yup, I jumped. Hard. It's a good thing that controllers aren't wired anymore, I may have yanked it out of the console.  When I think about replaying, the main thing that stops me is that only boring part early on after you make it out of the military zone and are climbing through skyscrapers in the rain. Only low point in the game and just meh Well that first bit where you have to get through a room in the subway is terrifying too... It's the first time you meet the clickers. That's why I learned that you can just run from them as soon as the generator is on, screw that shit, I ran hard. I don't play horror games, but I'm guessing you do, do you got more anxiety with the basement part than any other scary games? If so, I feel fine now! I always thought I was too chicken if I was scared of the basement part because I assumed games like Alien:Isolation and Outlast would be ten times worse. Amnesia used to scare me until I realized how the monsters were coded.

They literally see in a cone in front of them. Very little peripheral vision.  Also, you can pull a drawer out of a large dresser, hold it up like a shield and because of how big it is, the monsters literally can't see you, so you can just slide around them.

Monsters stop being scary when you can jump on their heads and they either swing wildly or don't give a fuck.

Also, the whole "Oh hey, I bet when I loot this item a monster will appear behind me!"  *grab* "Oh look, a monster where I expected one" got old real fast.  Haha yeah it's tough, VR would make it unplayable. I was playing Outlast and in the first five minutes got the shit scared out of me by a door closing, that's when I thought of how funny it would be if certain games had a "nope" option that just ended the game with your character ditching the situation.  2L2U:P2:EB I don't buy the 'Joel is dead the whole game' theory either. I don't actually have a theory for it, I just think it's a really well done trailer. "Ellie has a badass tattoo now" was mostly what I took away from the trailer.  Yeah, I looked at it again. But the resolution is waaay down, definitely not in game graphics darn. it would have preferred to keep playing as joel Had to stop reading after the 4th typo in the article.  So many spelling errors...  it was at TLOU PII panel was it not? not as funny as this comment Maybe because gold is stupid and reddit sucks. New life aspirations acquired  I love it. Needs a diagram though.  Really? You laughed so hard at that you cried? Water came out of your eyes? My first Reddit "laugh till I cry" moment was with a try hard comment like the parent one. Comment after comment of people describing redneck douche-bags with "truck nut hanging, tap-out shirt wearing..", stuff like that. I can't find it anymore. It's because Reddit's a bit autistic but  > XcQ

For those who don't know, XcQ is the last few letters of the Rick Roll youtube url. Here's a quick rundown of all of the other known troll links http://www.latlmes.com/world/how-to-never-get-rick-rolled-again-1 On mobile it just lunches the YouTube app lol
So you never know what you're getting yourself into You mean there is a country free of being Rick Roll'd? Where is this magical place? Narnia? Sorry, but it was me.  Thanks, but what I meant was that the tag only works if people know which game. Only by viewing the spoiler can you tell if it's a game that you want to avoid spoilers for. It's honestly the only thing that makes the story make sense, and Bioware fucked up in not running with Indoctrination Theory when they were already forced to rework the ending anyway because their audience was ready to string them up in the streets. 

The fandom practically giftwrapped a way for them to explain away all their narrative fuckery in a cool way and they ignored it for Casey Hudson's "artistic integrity".  That's my favorite theory ever, and so many people hate it You probably believe Squall is dead in FF8 too, don't you?

On the off chance that you do, he's not.  Look up the Dev's response to that theory. Me too, even the extended ending still didn't feel right to me.  So he's like Brad Pitt in Fight Club not like Patrick Swayze in Ghost? HOT SPOILERS FOR MASS EFFECT 3's ENDING ^^^even ^^^if ^^^it's ^^^a ^^^5 ^^^year ^^^old ^^^game ^^^at ^^^this ^^^point ^^^but ^^^whatever

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ythY_GkEBck) [was made to debate the ending, hinting that Shepard was indoctrinated by the reapers. A lot (like A LOT) of people started clinging on to this theory and  it turned out to be nothing.](/spoiler) Are you incapable of imagining anything beyond your immediate surroundings? I prefer Joelbi-Wan.   Yes this.  I don't want him to be dead,  and agree that if they do it'd take a departure into the supernatural which isn't what I'd want in TLOU.  Am I the only one who noticed Joel's voice sounded very different in this new trailer than the last of us game? Yeah, but Ellie appears to be at least 3 or 4 years older in the trailer. That's a pretty big gap. They could do some sort of prologue that shows how he died and that she's been on her own ever since. "You brought a bloater to church?" I honestly didn't care that much for Tess. The story centered on Ellie and Joel and the other characters really just didn't cut it for me early on in the game. Don't get me wrong I felt awful when Sarah died; but Tess? I just didn't really care about her. I did like Joel's Brother and a lot of the antagonists of the game though.  :) I would say it's probably one of the most intense and heartbreaking scenarios in any game ever made. The mixture of feelings and emotions can really get to you, and that's just the first 15 minutes or so. Uhh she had a broken leg and then was shot. Yeah, what a weakling. 😕 Man, you don't fuck around about Sarah. That shit cuts too deep, even now, years later. This is a perfect way of quickly moving on from the devastation one encounters in the beginning of TLOU.  I think a way better comparison would be Telltale's Walking Dead.  i feel like the difference here is that game of thrones has an entire ensemble of characters and plots and subplots. the last of us is very much joel and ellie's story, so killing off half of that duo would be much more significant. Are you talking about the points where you're staying out of the light to avoid being spotted by soldiers? If you are, you're crazy that scene was intense. 2 words: Dread Halls. FUCK. THAT. 2 Last 2 Usurious? Me too. I'm just looking forward to seeing where her character goes. 
I love the idea of her being this badass mini Lara Croft but also am terrified at the prospect of her becoming a ruthless young woman.  I've heard speculation that Joel is dead in this game and that's Ellie's reason for revenge.  It'd make sense, but damn would I be all kinds of butthurt. Honestly my favorite level in the game was playing as Ellie. Me too. People are going to assume right away its just because I don't want to play as a girl, but thats just not true. I grew to like playing as Joel. He is getting a bit old.  how old would he be though? hed probably be like 60 or 70 in TLOU2 wouldnt he? Yep, believe so /blush >1300 karma in 3 years

see you in 2246 I have a very visual mind. When people explain things to me or when I read something, I literally "see" it in my head. So yeah, I laughed pretty hard.  I FUCKING LOVE THE INTERNET You're a goddamn genius I clicked it and regretted right away, thinking it might just be the common second Rick Roll. The page loaded for a second and I thought I was wrong, but the music started and for some reason I was happy about it.

Thank you for that roller coaster of emotions. You're all wrong! It was me! Dio!  exactly. i just started playing this game. fuck this half ass warning. obviously it doesn't matter lol but the spoiler definitely doesn't work...unless you're supposed to assume that no matter what something you're involved in is about to be spoiled. What was the theory? I actually liked the way the story was presented to me when I played if. The Crucible was already Dues Ex Machina and the theme was sacrifice so... I was expecting something along the lines of not really "defeating" the reapers, since that was impossible. I avoided the internet to avoid spoilers and was floored by the unbelievable vitriol the community spat at the development team. 

That said, the Indoctrination theory was so much fun when I learned about it, and I absolutely loved it. I don't see anything wrong with making that a head-canon. Take it a bit further with the Marauder Shields comic someone wrote, and it was amazing. Yea still calling bull shit on the dead squall theory  Nope. I do like the Rinoa = Ultimecia theory though. 

What's your take on FF8's ending? I don't *actually* believe in Indoctrination Theory, I just think it makes the game better if you do. Similarly, I feel the same about SquallIsDead. Of course it's not true, but the game would be better if it was. Did Kazushige Nojima ever talk about this one? I know he addressed the FF7/10 connection, but I can't find anything about him addressing this FF8 theory. There's also the magic lamp/diablos explanation to debunk it. No dude we're saying *Joel* is a ghost. Patrick Swayze wasnt even in the last of us Look here. I just started playing that game, so thank you As someone who has never played mass effect and intends to, my thanks for the spoiler box 😊 Yeah but that's just not typically how they depict hallucinations of people in games and movies Joel Joel Binks A psychotic breakdown where Ellie sees hallucinations of him would still be pretty grounded. he doesn't have to be a ghost.  Hallucinating isn't supernatural though right? No one is saying he's a literal ghost.  I think you need to replay the original. Sounds the same. Same voice actor.  She's older, sure, but that doesn't mean Joel is dead.  Also it's pretty obvious Joel understands she's not a kid and can't influence her decisions.   Ellie could have easily slipped away (as she's known to do) in order to kill this group that was shown, and in doing so let Joel know that she wasn't going to stop until the deed was done.

I'd like to point out we have no clue who these guys are or why Ellie is super pissed off.  Though she's always been pretty pissed off so that's not new. If they're going to lead us to believe he's still alive even though he isn't then epilogue would work best. It would also suck if that's the last thing you see before the game is over, but man would it be powerful. See, and while Sarah really got to me and brought me to the brink of emotion... Nothing hit me like Sam and Henry. That was not only stabbing the knife, but twisting it too. with a semi automatic too! only wimps aren't able to handle that But he was in the trailer 

EDIT:Feel I should add she already wanted revenge when he shows up I really hope Joel isn't dead in the game, I want him to have to face Ellie when she finds out he's been lying to her all along. The game needs that resolution before he goes anywhere. Some say he's dead considering how he shows up with no evidence of fighting when clearly Ellie had been. As well as how he says the line he does.

I think it's also possible that Ellie ran off after disagreeing with Joel to find whoever these dudes were (just cause that sign has a firefly logo doesn't make them fireflies) and Joel shows up looking for her.

There are other reasons that could explain why Ellie is on a rampage, it's just Joel being dead is the one most people immediately thought. I understand, I think it would be great for the story but damn... I'd be sad if Joel is dead.  So long as it delivers fun gameplay and as great a story as the first one, Naughty Dog will have my money...dare I say even my pre-order. I'd be willing to bet that Joel dies very early in the game. You'll start the game as Joel and be in control of him when he dies. During the panel, the directorsaid something along the lines of "Ellie and Joel both play very differently in this game...." so it sounds like he is saying you play as him at least a little, maybe similar to the amount you played as Ellie in the first game.  Fan made rumors. Would be really stupid if that was the case.  That was a theory a redditor spun which means dick. No-one knows just yet.  I wanna guess that maybe she found out about what the fireflies were gonna do and she got mad too? I'm gonna be super bummed if this turns out to be true. All the surprise taken away on the comment section of the first trailer. for me it was fun because it was only a small part. The part where you kill the cannibal guy as Ellie is probably the most challenging part of the game. Only thing that felt like a boss fight.  I seriously hated it tbh. Pain in the ass cause I wasn't too great at stealth.  The DLC where you play as her is rad as fuck too!  I just kept yelling "Hey asshole, why can't you carry more than 6 bullets?" I just liked playing as a character with my given name for once. When Ellie asked for help, she was asking *me.* its only 6 years later... late 50 early 60.
EDIT: i checked he would be 54-55 not that old awww thanks man https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-title-adder/ddpephnhacfpgcemhioaejgenlgadnnh?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog So everybody who has come into contact with a reaper for any extended amount of time has become indoctrinated. Saren, Benezia, Illusive Man, etc. Well Shepard has also spent considerable amount of time around them, but never got indoctrinated? 

In the ending you have 3 choices; Blue, Green, Red in that order. Now all throughout the series these colors have represented Paragon (blue), neutral (green), and Renegade (red), and they have always been in that order for dialogue and QTEs. 

Now all along Shepard has said the reapers must be destroyed because of the threat they pose to everyone, and the Illusive Man has shown he wants to control the reapers for mankind. Now agreeing with the Illusive Man in 2 was pretty much always a renegade choice, where as paragon went against him. 

So when Shepard is on the crucible and he has to pick between; Control (blue) the reapers, Synthesis (green) to make everyone the same, or Destroy (red) them, in that order. So then why is Controlling and letting the reapers live the paragon choice? Even though every Paragon option has been rooted in destroying them. 

The reapers would of course want to live and even though Shepard's conscience is inside them there is no guarantee that it will last or won't be overwritten by reaper coding. So it stands to believe Shepard is indoctrinated because of the choices that align the the Morality system presented across the whole series.

Edit: this is a simplified explanation so if I missed a key point I do apologize. That Shepard ended up indoctrinated by the Reapers, and the whole end game choice was him trying to either break or succumb to the indoctrination  Oh I envy you if you are learning it for the first time. It saved the last game for me, still cant believe they didn't go with it. I also just tend to think back and choose to believe that is what actually happened. You should just search indoctrination theory on YouTube, they are interesting to watch. I think the most helpful are about an hour long though. This is assuming you played and liked mass effect of course. u/NeroIV did a good job summing it up. But if you want to go deeper down the rabbit hole, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ythY_GkEBck) is the video that I watched. All butthurt aside, I actually was satisfied with the extended cut of ME3 and am still looking forward to Andromeda. I think Bioware learned their lesson about listening to the fanbase, or at least promising one thing and delivering another.  Probably because magic actually works like it does in game, in the story.  Wait, you *didn't* see Patrick Swayze in TLoU? Mate you missed one of the best parts of the game! Have fun playing Me3! I HIGHLY Recommend you play Leviathan DLC during your playthrough. Jesus dies! I assumed she meant the rest of the fireflies... after what they did to her at the university lab. I assume there's tons more throughout the country and she wants to kill them all. 

And possibly, they killed Joel shortly after the first story for rescuing her. So she wants revenge

Joel's voice sounds as though he can't control what she's doing, and sounds to me like her internal moral voice bothering her as she goes on this long blood rampage by herself. The hypothesis is that he's dead and she's seeing him as some kind of companion/angel on the shoulder kind of deal.  So before the trailer, Joel has been killed.  She tracks some of the Fireflies down and slaughters them.  She knows what Joel would say - "You really gonna go through with this?" because she knows he cared enough about her that he'd say her life is not worth risking for revenge. But Ellie don't give a *fuuuuck*, dude.

*Chill, y'all.  It's not my hypothesis, but I don't really care.  If you have reason to believe otherwise, make a case.  Just saying "thats garbage, naughty dog iz too pure for this wurld, i hate it" is not a compelling argument. Hallucination maybe. His line to her in the trailer is interesting - "what are you doing, kiddo?"

Either they've been separated for a period of time or he is not really there and it's a projection of her own conscience, which is how I interpreted it. Ghosts and hallucinations and dreams are very real to the people experiencing them, in reality and in video games.  ;)   we never really see his face IIRC and he comes out of a white light. Strong drugs can kill the feels... but also make a young woman hallucinate. Spoiler alert, her look at the end of part 1: she knows. To then play it like she had no clue would turn the character into an idiot. She already knows. There was an offical stage play type thing about them mending their relationship after the first game due to her knowing what he did. > Some say he's dead considering how he shows up with no evidence of fighting when clearly Ellie had been. As well as how he says the line he does.

Well he could have gone somewhere and come back afterthe fighting was done. If I recall she looks dirty and bloodied while Joel looks relatively clean...at least from our angle. Followed by  
>WINTER Like playing as Ashley Graham in RE4. Would have been hilarious if they'd let you keep her "plot stealth" that allowed her to be out in the open but still unnoticed. He's old in the first one. He was over 30 when his daughter died. That would put him close to 50 if not a little beyond by the first game. Almost 55-60 here. That's old to be running around and fighting 30 year olds.  No: Thank you, u/patmandu As handy as that extension looks, I'm actually a little disappointed that your link wasn't another rickroll Guys I came to this thread for Last of Us news don't make me feel the Mass Effect ending rage again please please please God no  The morality system of the series is

paragon: inclusiveness

Renegade: exclusiveness

The blue option includes them into a new galactic order, the red one excludes them.  I may be wrong, but from my memory after the conversation between the "boy" and Shepard a few things had been established about the conflict between mechanical beings like Geth and reapers and organic species, leaning towards a cycle of birth and destruction that has persisted for God knows how long. From my perspective, Shepard had or at least should have learned that blatant destruction of the reapers really isn't the right option, just a reversal of the cycle, not an end. Soon, cosmically speaking, mechanical beings would come into play once more and either destroy or be destroyed just like organics. If he or she fails to recognize this then they have failed to follow the Paragon path, of the greater good it would appear. The blue and green options offer a cesation of this cycle, which in my opinion is the less obvious but better long term option. Also, let's not forget that destruction of the reapers would be the destruction of ALL mechanical species, so the Geth that you saved and managed a peace with the quarians(assuming you were paragon) would be wiped out along with every organic with a biotic implant. That's shortsighted and obviously a Renegade move. This is my opinion anyway, I don't think the indoctrination theory really is all that great and I appear to be in the minority. That's okay though, kind of the beautiful thing about games like Mass Effect.  THAT was the simplified version? The controlling and synthesis option are Paragon because you suddenly (inexplicably) gained more power/choice in the story.

If someone entered your house and wanted to kill your whole family, shooting them would probably be paragon because that would be the best possible choice. 

But if you got magical green/blue powers and could protect everyone without killing the invader and made sure he never hurt anyone that would be paragon, killing him is only for when you have no alternative. Woah cheers for writing that up. This theory is definitely better than whatever canon says Reminds me of infamous, you decide to be bad and have bad guy powers only to save the world or be good and then genocide everyone. Whether you liked the ending of ME3 or not, Andromeda looks soooo hype. Not sure how you couldn't be excited for it. Hmmmmm not sure if trolling or not... 😜 what did they do to her at the lab? Ooh man I can already feel the tears flowing.. The trailer doesn't really give that away because you can see him step over things, he's holding a gun, he's making noise etc. But at the same time we never see his face and to me the biggest argument that he's dead is: what the hell else would get Ellie so riled up she's going to start hunting down people. Honestly this would be my favorite way to handle the ending of Last of Us.

Ellie doesn't know what Joel did and thinks the fireflies are assholes for killing him prior to Part 2

And the truth gets revealed and she has to come to terms with everything and then has to make a real choice. I really hope they don't gloss over the fact that Joel killed a fuckton of innocent people and went against what Ellie wished for just to portray Joel as some super good guy or a martyr by killing him off and making it a revenge thing. I really hope their relationship will be deeper and much more filled with tension. Would be reasonable seeming as he also lied too her That's really cheesy. I'd hate that  I've also seen a theory that Ellie has a kid and the fireflies kidnap it for the cure. I'd much rather it be that then the "Ghost Joel" theory. Really don't like that idea. This is a shit theory  Which could be why we didn't see his face. He was just an angel or a figment of her imagination.  I don't think that's the case tbh. I think the story and setting is too grounded in reality to have a Dexter/Harry Morgan visions thing going on. I think it'd undermine Ellie's character to depend on Joel so much that she literally cannot live without him by her side. Especially since the whole theme of the first game is moving on. This is very bittersweet, as I think a PTSD ridden Ellie would make for an EXCELLENT protagonist.. But at the same time Joel dying would not only be soul crushing, but it also means we would not get the see the interaction between Ellie and Joel when Ellie finds out the truth of the ending of the first game.. We might even receive some weird Ellie talking to her imaginary Joel from her visons about it, and that would not give Ellie nor us as players closure on that arc. Either that, or Joel IS alive and her objective is to kill him as revenge for something.... The way he walked into the house though looked like he was alive, usually in those scenarios they just pop up if they're a ghost but than again maybe that'd be too obvious Yeah, people are reading way too much into a short trailer. That makes alot of sense. This is Joel we're talking about. If he thinks Ellie is about to do something stupid he wouldn't just ask her "You really wanna go through this?" He'd just kidnap her and stick her in a basement somewhere. So the trailer implies to me that Joel can't actually stop her. Maybe because he's just Ellie's imagination.

Damnit Reddit, I just went through this with you people with Westworld... Im pretty sure Troy Baker said the trailer wasn't canon on the panel That's not a hypothesis. That's pure speculation This is what I took away from it. Backing you up and calling this now. Damn, that reminds me of bioshock infinite burial at sea, good old radio Booker.  The "Joel is dead the whole time" is so fucking tropey and lame. They're not going to follow up an incredible story with something that's been done a thousand times.  I'm betting Joel's going to be like an imaginary friend in this game. She'll talk to him, ask for advice, and he'll offer words of comfort and direction (ex: being chased by an enemy, he'll tell you to "hide here" or "go this way") until the big reveal that he's been dead for a year. Pls let me dream ;-; Not necessarily... she could've just ran off and went through with it and he followed her.

Maybe she found out what they wanted to do to her or somethinf like that. It's a little grey on whether that's canon or not. Troy Baker (Joel) denied that it was and Druckmann gave a "well..." in response to Baker' denial.  Link? It looked to me like Ellie had gone out and killed a bunch of people and Joel tracked her down. I personally really hope the theory is wrong and Joel isn't dead but as long as Naughty Dog does it properly I'll get over it. It sounds like Neil, Ashley, and Troy have a real love for these characters so I'm going to try to trust in whatever decision they make in regards to this. Run little rabbit, RUN I dunno why, but this comment gave me goosebumps in some weird nostalgic flashback-y way. That chapter was so bleak. look at the wiki he is 48 during TLOU [http://i.imgur.com/](http://i.imgur.com/Muh7YYP.jpg)[Muh7YYP](https://i.imgur.com/9Fw8N0a.jpg)[.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Muh7YYP.jpg) That was indeed incredibly disappointing :( I just finished a draft of a paper that disxusses the ending of me3. Now it seems to be coming up everywhere D: Yes. I've watched a few hours of video explaining it in greater depth and showing examples from the game. It was a great theory and made me love ME3 just as much as ME2 and ME.  Ok simpler version, Reapers mind control everything and you have no reason to suspect you're immune. In the final sequence you're presented with an insane dreamlike scene and a choice where all the morality colors are inverted from what was used over the past 3 games. Shepard's (**and the player's**) final battle is to recognize and resist Reaper control over his mind.

That's it really.

The game has been hand holding you for dozens of hours by carefully labeling every decision with good as blue and evil as red. The final challenge is figure out right from wrong on your own.

Shedding all of the detailed lore support, the fact that they flip morality at the last and arguably most important decision of the game made the theory pretty solid. Why would they flip the whole color system on its head for only this one final decision? Felt like it just had to be an intentional choice from the developers. The final battle being subtly subversive test of your moral compass that the franchise had been preparing the player for ever since ME2 would have made for an incredibly innovative ending to cap off an impressive trilogy. It'd stand up there among the best mindfuck endings in games of all time. Better yet, it's not just a cheap surprise twist, it's an entirely fair test of the player's ability to think for themselves. 

People loved Bioshock 1's meta ending where they reveal Ryan's control of the character. Here in ME3 it seemed like they one upped that ending with a meta control of the actual player's mind! **This ending could have been legendary as one of the best game endings anyone had ever seen**  The crux of the theory is that the last section of the game actually takes place in Shepard head. 

The tldr is that the reapers are attempting to coercively mind control you, and going with what is presented as the good option is actually giving into that mind control. I'll make it simpler. The moral choices at the end seem clearly switched from what we've come to expect from tbe characters, and this is explained as the reapers altering Shepherd's perspective in order to make the "best" scenario the one in which they live. Yeah but the killer has killed trillions of people in home invasions in the past, so it'd honestly be pretty shitty of you to *not* kill him. The thing with this is, I didn't trust the information the reapers were giving me. To use your analogy, it would be giving up your opportunity to neutralize the invader, on the promise from the invader himself the blue / green powers would work. 

I further still believe this was the correct answer, because the star child tells you flat out, the red option would also kill Shepard because of the cybernetics used in bring her back to life. If you get the extended ending, we see Shepard taking a breath after the explosion. We already have proof the Reapers were lying about one thing, why not everything? I'm excited for anything Bioware puts out, I don't even care. I mean basically it's shut up and take my wallet at this point.  [They wanted to find a cure and were willing to kill her to do so. We also found out that there were others immune like her that they killed trying to create a cure with no success.](/spoiler "Mouse over for") Besides prep to cut out her brain?  No game before or since has hit me in the "Oh shit... didn't expect that" sadness feels like Joel's Daughter getting killed. I don't know how their gonna top that one.  I can already remember the feeling I had during the last stage. People often complain how we are so loaded down like a tank it's not fair. But after going through that and having a full arsenal made it that much better. I burned used every fucking bomb I had just on single enemies.  Damn phantom onion cutters! The theory isn't that he's a ghost, but a product of Ellie's mind.  >What else would get Ellie so Riley'd up

Heh Also, in TLoU he has a few grey hairs but in the Part II trailer his hair is completely brown.  Isn't she perhaps pregnant in another screenshot? Could her baby had been killed? Or perhaps she is mad about how she became pregnant.  Revenge is a personal thing.  She saw all the things he did, all the people he killed.  It wouldn't have any effect on how painful his death would be to her.

As for the ending of the first game, I could see that being a pretty great reveal, coming to her after she's already killed a number of fireflies in revenge, realizing that her mentor and father figure had lied to her about something so fucking huge. Ellie knew Joel was lying to her at the end though. She didn't care because she knew in that moment that he truly cared about her.

I think it makes it pretty clear all the way through the entire game that Joel isn't a good person and his reasons for saving Ellie aren't anything to do with his moral compass - he's found an anchor to this new world in Ellie and he'll do anything he can to protect that. "He may have been a murdering asshole bastard... but he was MY murdering asshole bastard." Yes, thank you. Naughty Dog is known for good writing, and this fan theory people are talking about is trash writing. Joel being a ghost? You know what an insane cop-out that is to include one of the two main characters as a ghost? Naughty Dog is not that dumb.

I want Joel alive and Ellie alive so we can witness their deeper relationship. For the love of God, that's the entire point of That Last Of Us. The first game was all about the father-daughter relationship slowly blooming in the trashed world. It was incredible. "Cheese" depends entirely on how something is portrayed, or written.  No idea is "cheese-y" in and of itself, it entirely depends on how capable the people handling it are.

Every story or twist you've ever read or experienced has been a retread of something that came before it, for the most part.

This is coming from someone who really does *not* want to see Joel dead. Yeah, just like every other stupid theory redditors make up and think they're genius for Not at all. Its a pretty common and powerful plot device.

It was used pretty well in the walking dead with Ricks phone call She's like 19 and she already has a kid? Who's the father? Don't like either option presented but dead-Joel would be a little bit better to me than teen-revenge-mom Ellie.  Ellie's into chicks tho dude To my mind Ellie will always be gay. Ellie has a kid from Joel. Nice idea

edit: It was a sarcastic comment ffs I'm thinking kind of like Fight Club or Scrubs with Dr. Cox's buddy, stuff like that - the mind makes the scenario fit.  You never see them arrive, but your brain patches that part of the narrative.  You know what I mean? >hypothesis: a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.

You were saying...?

 In all fairness, the first game was very "tropey" as well. However, it managed to be better than the sum of its tropes.  In order to prevent this from happening, we have to blast it all over reddit so that the writers will see this and change the ending. Kinda like in Dexter?

Huh. I think i like the sound of that. Wasn't that a CoD game plot? Maybe its a result of not doing anything about the stuff growing all over her head. Similar to BATMAN SPOILER: how Joker in Arkham Knight follows batman around? I'd like that. I was upset about his possible death at first but this seems rad tbh If he's dead I suspect, and hope, that they'll just state it outright. The ghost still appears but he's not meant to be a M. Shyamalan twist, instead his meant to be a projection of Ellie's conscience and internal conflict. Since Ellie would be alone there wouldn't be much of a story to tell otherwise. You'll must likely have dream sequences where he is in it, yes. So everything I said is approximately accurate. Almost 50 and almost 55-60 sure sounds close to 48 and 54 in my opinion.  I wouldn't have considered the ending of ME3 to be well put together enough to warrant a paper analyzing it.  Is it a paper about how they dropped the fucking ball? I really think the devs liked the theory and would have used it during the rework if they wanted. I mean they said at one point Shepard wasn't alive yet we got the breath scene so yes Shepard does live we just don't know what he/she is doing now. I understand it. It's still silly. Not really. I mean, if you're guaranteeing that he won't kill anyone else in the future, there's no reason to kill him than to feel better about it. Killing the home invader won't change anything or bring anyone back. It will only make you feel better for getting revenge. Not that it's an invalid response, I just don't think it's shitty of you not to kill him. It takes a bigger person to resist the revenge killing than it does to give in to our emotions and kill said person. Did you play the Dragon Age games? I was actually disappointed by Inquisition. I didn't feel nearly as engaged as I did with Origins. Hell, I even beat Dragon Age 2 but not Inquisition. Which she was ok with and wanted.  That's the target. I remember him, he was off base nine years ago.

 Bring 'em home, Boss! Enemy using "special" forces... Looked like chivalry for a minute there Jesus fuck, that's terrifying. I'm in the springtime of my youth! This guy runs up and slaps your girl on the ass, wat do? Alright, I've watched this too many times not to ask: 

What is going on with that player? Is it the fire? Is it the whiskey he had with the other privates in the trench? How is that possible in the game? He looks like doctor strange being pulled around by his cape.  https://youtu.be/raFKSZEEjv0 looks like an abnormal from attack on titan Someone put horror music over this.  TIL Master Bo Rai Cho served in WW1 This is why i had to stop playing these kinds of games... i want to relax when i play, not throw the controller through the tv Moves like Jagger  that looks more like a zombie game to me lol This is some Dark Souls shit. All those shots did actually miss. That was kind of scary lol Fuck, now I can believe Batman and the thugs missing. That cape fucks with your eyes. V for Vendetta sewer scene. Someone really need to put sound on this. 

"BWRBRLWBGGRLRLGRLGLRGLLL!!!!"  Shit looks like moves straight out of cowboy bebop or some shit Which game is that? This is why I play Battlefield 1. Frickin' Lahey.
 Love that mini-map. I would recommend it to anyone playing BF1 to increase it.  must be on console because that aim is horrible. If it looks stupid, but works, It's not stupid.

^You ^are ^dead, ^he ^is ^not. A+ for title >I am the night. Would love to see how this guys pov looked like This is both hilarious and horrifying. There's just no stopping him. As soon as you see him you KNOW he's going to win. i think i'd get ptsd from playing this "Opie stop!"
"Wagalhaalahalahaa" The cape really brings this scene to life Speshul tactics Reminds me of the monsters from Amnesia. Look like he took some training with master Bo Rai Cho Game title???  This is me every game. I can't hit anyone /u/ItsaDnDMonsterNow?  reminds me of the vanoss mw3 videos Its obvious why you're using the only automatic medic gun This actually scares the fuck out of me.  This is the essence of nightmares. /r/HitBoxPorn That's me right here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74OBuMA2qEk Nah he's just a Mount and Blade player that has decided to try out BF1.  EWWW

Buckhorn sights  Would never have died on PC.  You can't even be mad that he killed you when he does it like that, you know? The way he moves is really unsettling. It reminds me of that [creepy Korean webcomic.](http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/detail.nhn?titleId=350217&no=31) That was a damned zombie attack! Jesus Christ it's Jason Bourne  As devastatingly-unpredictable as [lag-fu](https://youtu.be/2kr7KDCsIws?t=8m14s). It's the way the charge animation works. The guy probably went straight at you on his screen, but it just spazzed out on yours. Basically, you were already dead before you could squeeze the trigger, you just didn't know it yet. That's what you get for being a prone camping little bitch No shit, I was doing research on drunken boxing style for like 5 hours last. It seems like a very cool way to get your dick beat by someone "good" at karate. 

You never see anyone actually drinking like Jackie Chan though. 

I'm still much more a fan of Qi-Gong. Lift up, pour down, if ya know know what I mean, m8.  Lol that maxi map, though. Was the character model actually reacting to being shot? Shit like this happens to me every game, yet I still play...  It's like a splicer traveled back in time.   Thank you buddy Abyss watchers? Also known as latency issues and button mashing.

Wonder how accurate the hitregion mesh is.

I should get BF1.... Oh boy, this is golden! Looks funny now, but when that happened to me in game I would be tilted off the planet. This is insanely hilarious. maroon 5, moves like jagger, was playing in the background when I opened this. it's a perfect fit That gotta be FPS Doug Jesus that HUD is so cluttered. How can you play an fps when you barely have a peripheral view?  That's terrifying... If you can dodge a bullet you can dodge a ball! As a fellow drunken gamer, I feel your pain. Stay strong, brotha. ✊🏿 Why didn't any of those bullets hit him? Looks like we found jar jar binks apprentice Chantastic. dude's just dodging all the bullets here So this is what happened to the soldiers after mother base Lol Any word on when we can expect hardcore mode?  lmao Anybody else notice that his ammo counter when down to two and then back up to three when he died? Rofl.. just rofl xD This is mildly terrifying.... Serves him right for being a camping little bitch. The shooter or the attacker?  More like spin bot style Good on you to laugh it off and put it on reddit. I'd be pissed if that happened to me in game.  I shit myself watching this I think it was an accident. He was dancing and you got in his way. You need to apologize. He must be traumatized. Fuck thats terrifying.. That's terrifying... that is how you dodge bullets people You got derped! This is the thing of nightmares. All I could think of was Dr. Strange the dude playing sucks though That's scary Did you really miss 7 shots in a row? That gave me the best laugh in this year. I was waiting for a bus and people around me were weirded out.  I'm more disgusted at that potato aim wth. This game is great for /r/gaming, I enjoy the .gifs that come out of it. This is why I couldn't get into this game.  You can shoot all day at someone but it's almost like your gun is a pea shooter at best. I don't normally laugh at gaming gifs but this is great. You know something's coming when he's just looking intently into the fog... Jade Empire sure looks different. *Queue infuriating 10 min chase* MSF were trained in special evasion tactics.

Over here, squire! I need help with my codpiece. That game's gone downhill ever since they fixed the "TO ME" bug. This is hilarious and the perfect title for this!  **OH MY GOD THERE’S MORE OF THEM INCOMIIINNNNGGGGGGGGG!!!!** YOUR ALL FOAM AND NO MEAD! So glad this is high up, holy shit lolol
**AGATHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!** But the gif is only 6 seconds long..... Yeah, more like Silent Hill style. I've screamed and jumped off the couch getting bayoneted a few times in battlefield. It's so sudden and the truly scary part is the hellish scream that they have. It's like they got real audio of someone getting gutted to death.  KYOJIN Go walk on your hands or something. Do 500 laps around the village. I loved that Guy, what was his name again? What a Guy... Nothing. She his girl now. thank him Have her walk up and apologize to him "Babe, you got this right?"

I would laugh at that rathet than rage about something quite hilarious You don't like games where you have to run around like an idiot and die 50 times a session!? My life trying to play CS GO as a scrub. Every match has at least one ridiculously OP, aim assisted, wall hacking asshole. And they never show up on my team.  Partly why I love NWI's Insurgency and Day of Infamy games. If you're having an off day or don't feel like try harding, it's a ton of fun to go through co-op missions with other players vs. an army of bots. I played Modern Warfare 2 when it came out. It was my first and last online FPS experience. To begin with it wasn't so bad, but it got progressively harder as other people improved and I stayed at around the same skill level as always. Like a flat line, maybe a sex-seven degree incline. It stopped being fun and I never bought another one. Now I'm casual scum and couldn't be happier. I mean, this guy was shooting near him, not actually shooting him, so I guess he was too relaxed? When my kills are higher than my deaths it makes me unbelievably happy. But the 90% of playtime that I get slaughted without firing a shot makes me feel like a stroppy teenager.  No shit you get frustrated when you play this game with a controller.
Or any FPS for that matter. I hate that song, I can't wait til it's forgotten. hey joe wanna play a zombie game Legit the only thing i could think of Right? Seems crazy noone else mentioned it. The aim is too low and overshooting every time the player tries to aim.  That *is* the point of the drunken master style tho...

But seriously the whole point of it is to make your movements unpredictable so your opponent can't anticipate enough to land a blow, sword strike, or get a read on a clear line of fire. My first thought was [M Bison from Street Fighter](https://imgur.com/gallery/HOkEbgl)

Edit - My own link is broken for me lol but yeah, M Bison.  Came looking for this comment, wasn't disappointed I had to scroll to find this but I was hoping someone else thought of the sewer scene.  Battlefield 1 *"Your technique is lacking"* Battlefield .... one ( 1 ) ...  >get your dick beat by someone "good" at karate

Sounds good to me Well, drunken boxing is a distinct martial art called zui quan. Not sure why you called it karate? But knowing the actual name of it might help you find more stuff on the internet. :) I don't know what you mean On top of that it's got nothing on the my dick to your fist style. Nope, it usually says "enemy hit" when you shoot them. He may have been reacting to the fire in that building  Looks like every shot missed though, the aim was bad. The hub offers full customisation, the guy has chosen to have it like that, the map is far too big. You could get into a box and walk to him. He'll run up to you (still in the box) and then salute and then you're free to Fulton him away A queue is a line. A cue is a sign to start. As in, "That's my cue!" Or one shot in the head with the sniper tranq gun before he aggros.  Or you could just play that one song and have them walk right up to you. When you go to find the lost soldiers, put the box on your head and walk up to them they will immediately recognize you and you don't have to chase. When you get a wanderering soldier with picture. Go to the medical platform and search for a door that will open. If I am right. I am not gonna spoil it Well they **did** end up using some of the French

In Battlefield you often have to fight against the urge to swarm and run into the fray, but if you manage, your score is gonna be much better, and much less dying.

That said, you still got to GET ON THE GODDAMN POINT, FUCK! Thats the reason I dont like games like Battlefield although I love shooter games. Thats why I playing Squad.

The DICE games are fun to pick up and play here and there but it's just too silly when you force people to continuously run around over and over. I miss playing Source...even 1.6.

Almost made me cry the first time I did that lol maybe it's because I played and actually enjoyed Ground Zeroes hahaha Ground Zeroes is amazingly what got me into the series. Yup. For centuries France was the strongest military force in mainland Europe. I mean, Napoleon is one of the most successful generals in world history. The meme is really only based on post German formation Europe, where things have kinda gone downhill for their military rep. They're known for having tanks with 6 reverse gears.  They have the best win/loss record of any country. Shh. We don't talk about that around here. At the beginning of WWII the french were considered to have one of the more powerful armies. It was a combination of superior german tactics and some silly french generals that led to such a quick defeat. Yeah they were. They only reason France surrendered so quickly was because the country was pretty much leveled during WWI. They were no were near recovered. So they "gave" up and citizens went underground to from the Resistance. Only real choice they had I loved the usage of the word tenacious in this context, exquisite! They had a really good record until Napoleon showed up.  It depends on how you rate success.  France had the most powerful military in Europe for a long time and frequently won short-term victories.  But it is striking that it was never able to secure its place as top dog despite this.  For example, one way of seeing Napoleon's career is as a striking succession of dramatic French victories with a couple of losses at the end.  Another way to see it is as a string of preliminary victories that served no ultimate strategic end and that led only to complete disaster and defeat for France.

That aside, there is no question that France's military history has plenty of glory to go about and is really only tarnished by the collapse at the start of WWII and by the similar collapse in the Franco-Prussian war. I believe under Napoleon, they have the best military record in modern European history. But I'm English so they'll always be cheese-eating surrender monkeys in my heart.  Napleon got all the badass French killed.  Yes , apparently the concept of coward frenchies is a new thing from ww2. When in reality they just came out a bloody war and knew what would come from it. So opted not to repeat it.

Prior to that the French where held with high regard in terms of military power I would imagine.

The obviouse one being Napoleon. They had the best ground military in WW1 and 2. The German high command were stunned with their victories in 1940 as was the whole world.  That would be us Canadians.  Historically one of the most successful military forces on the face of the planet! Even during WWII they shown resilience and fine tactical strategy as a country in covert rebellion Even in WWII they were extremely tenacious. People joking about the French surrendering etc are people with little to no knowledge of WWII history - The French lost hundreds of thousands trying to hold off the Nazi's, they sacrificed so much that in the end surrender was the only option left to them. Even in WW2.

France may have been annexed, but the French Resistance was awesome. Exactly. The French took the brunt of WWI casualties and was considered the sword of the allies in that conflict. A lost generation of men later, and the German bombardment of civilian targets, greatly affected fighting spirit in WWII. They were until Napoleon died, then all of French tactical thought ended promptly.  Yes, and even IN WW2 the free french resistance forces were BAMFs, and the french army held off the Nazis in North Africa for years I cant tell if you are being sarcastic or not.. Well, they still spoke German back then. Don't you fucking tell them how to run their life.

[Think like Magneto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhSYEMEEG5c) Cannon fodder You do realize the game doesn't force you to run around, right? Odd, I'd figure India would have hackers.

It's a bigger deal of you played Peace Walker.  You spend the entire game building Motherbase just to have Cypher blow it up in Ground Zeroes.  The feels... Their military reputation was heavily affected for not getting involved in the war in Iraq. The US was really butthurt by the fact, and among other things renamed french fries to freedom fries and began backtalking the French military.

France was one of many nations who surrendered in WW2. After WW1 the population was pretty sick of war and they didn't want another meaningless slaughter. The US didn't even get involved until the end, Great Britain was protected by the sea, and Russia was even allied with Germany at the start. I don't know if they've necessarily gone downhill.

I feel like after WWII and the sharing of resources with NATO, it's difficult for one European military to really stand out in this day and age. Maybe aside from the UK because they seem to get lumped into whatever the US is doing.

But anyways, I think France is still up there in military power. I'd say they're in the top 5. Above the UK. Why does it have 6 pedals if there's only 4 directions? It's a tactical repositioning. That's a good W/L but what about their K/D? The Maginot line doomed them completely, and all because they assumed that fucking *Hitler* wouldn't try going through Belgium. Thank you!

I originally used a different word there, but quickly realized that it didn't fit.

This was never really serious, they are still called french fries or just fries

>began backtalking the French military

This definitely began before the Iraq War 
 France got overrun because they built a wall after WW1 to stop the Germans from ever invading again. Unfortunately the French didn't extend that wall north of their boarder with Germany...and so the Germans just went around it when they attacked. Since the French had all of their best troops stationed on the wall the rest of France was pretty much left undefended. This is why france was overrun and surrendered in record time. They deserve the flack the get for idiotic military tactics, Hell they should get more flack. This is a vast oversimplification of recent military history, ignoring some major points like Frances loss in Vietnam, and unwillingness to cooperate with NATO during the cold war sometimes.  And no, the French did not concede WWII to the Germans to prevent a "meaningless slaughter". The French are kind of big on Sovereignty and being French, which is why they had such a major resistance force against the Germans. >US didn't get involved until the end

>Russia was even allied with Germany at the start

You're conflating facts from both wars into one.

The US joined near the end for WW1, but fairly early on WW2

Russia was against Germany in WW1 from beginning but had non-aggression pacts with them at beginning of WW2 T be fair Britain was on par with France for the majority of European history and even defeated them a few times. France surrendered to preserve Paris so it wouldn't be destroyed.  > Above the UK

By what metrics? > Above the UK.

Really? I thought we were more or less on an equal footing with them, not above.

Tell me why do you think France is above? Equipments are of the same generation and we both have nukes, as well as submarines capable of launching them.

 Churchill was going to sacrifice Scotland to the Nazis 

True story.   >> United Kingdom of Great Britain and **Northern Ireland** here. It's a Channel and we wouldn't have surrendered if the Germans had invaded, we'd have bristled our moustaches and tutted at their savagery until they apologised and left. 

Irish person here - I can attribute that the british rarely give up...places/things that they stole. Yes just like when the saxons invaded, or when the Vikings invaded, or when the Norman's invaded. You guys have an impeccable record if I do say so myself. France probably suffered the worst out of all the countries in WWI. Most of the Western Front was on French soil. 

The English have never really experienced total warfare like the French. This calls for the British version of MURICA!!!!! I'm not sure people in France were even offended by the freedom fries since we all know that fries are belgian ;) If I recall correctly, the American stereotype of the French always surrendering started during the Vietnam War when the French backed out of Vietnam because they thought the war couldn't be won.

I do think the idea was solidified, especially among younger people who were not around during the Vietnam War, when France refused to invade Iraq with the US. Whilst this is true and the reason for their quick surrender it benefits from hindsight which makes their decision to rely on the Maginot line stupid but at the time was sensible. Nobody expected the German tanks to be able to pass through the Ardennes forest so easily. The line extended through belgium and they fully expected the Germans to pass through the lowlands. So they could reinforce the line when they did. But the Germans were faster then expected. Also the lack of reserves for holding up the German army was also partly because no one expected Germany to rebuild their military so quickly either. That time period was one where military technology took a great leap forward. Many of the presumptions made by the French was on a war similar to WWI where warfare was slow and land had to be gained inch by inch. How could they be expected to account 20 years into the future where tanks and planes had increased so greatly and could circumvent natural terrain so easily? Idiotic now? Yeah for sure. Back then probably not. They were probably just thinking how the hell it happened. > France got overrun because they built a wall after WW1 to stop the Germans from ever invading again.

Wrong. The wall was built so that a direct attack was impossible, forcing Germany to invade either Belgium or Switzerland to attack, making their diplomatic position untenable while forcing the UK to come to French aid.

> Unfortunately the French didn't extend that wall north of their boarder with Germany

They didn't extend the wall through the Belgium border for several reasons, the most important two of which was that the wall was a gargantuanly expensive project, which was seen as unneeded as the time it took for the Germans to plow through Belgium would allow the French to move in to help, keeping the war and devastation away from French soil. Secondly, diplomatically speaking, building the wall through Belgium would be sending the signal to Belgium and other countries Germany invaded, that France was leaving them as cannon fodder for Germany, to be occupied at will. The diplomatic consequences of this would be severe, and affect France even the war started, as a Belgian government aware of such a fact would much more readily cooperate with the Germans and against the French to prevent needless slaughter.

> and so the Germans just went around it when they attacked.

The Germans had already went around the position where the wall was built in WW1, before the wall was built. If they hadn't built any wall, the Germans would still have come from Belgium, if they wanted to defeat France.

> Since the French had all of their best troops stationed on the wall the rest of France was pretty much left undefended.

This is so patently false on all accounts, it's mindboggling how you decided the need to make your post.

The French were defeated because the Germans made several feints in Belgium and attacked the Netherlands specifically with the purpose of luring the French army into Belgium and the Netherlands, while the faster sections of the German army, namely their tank divisions, snuck through a heavily forested area in Belgium, under heavy air superiority cover. Once they were out of the forest, the French army defending that section was considerably light, since they presumed the Germans couldn't come from there without being spotted or with the need for heavy regrouping, which would allow the French forces to rebalance. The problem with this theory is that it failed to taking into account the mobility of the new tank forces. Once the tanks were out, they drove to the coast (Not around the wall as you ignorantly speak), to trap the French and British armies who had advanced to Belgium and the Netherlands, and then to attack those armies from all sides until they surrendered.

Neither the best units nor most of the army was posted on the wall, since the wall was impregnable, and the best units were not needed there. They based their defenses on the assumption that Belgium wouldn't disappear in a second. Nothing withstood blitzkrieg. Except the Russian winter. That withstood blitzkrieg. Other than that, nothing. 

I mean, apart from the English channel. That was kind of effective too. 

TL;DR don't share a border with a dangerous superpower After Japan dropped a whole bunch of fuck you how about that on Hawaii... >fairly early on WW2

More than two years in.  And it didn't exactly 'join'.  Japan and Germany declared war on it. Please correct me if I'' wrong here. This memory is from a jr high report and it's been over 20 years.

I understand that Russia and Germany were in a non-aggression stance on the eve of world war 2, but wasn't this simply a temporary thing resulting from their recent proxy war involvement in the Spanish civil war? As in, they just finished an unofficial fight and had called a truce after it became clear that Francisco Franco was going to win? 

Again, I'm working from an old memory here so feel free to correct me. Not really re the USA. WW2 is traditionally defined as starting Sep 1 1939 when Germany invaded Poland (some historians now give 1937 as a start date: Japan's invasion of China). The USA didn't enter until Dec 7 1941 after Pearl Harbor. That is 25 months after the traditional start. From then it was 45 months until the Japanese surrender - so the USA didn't come into the war until well after a third of the way through. That isn't really "fairly early on" (though it is compared with their entry into WW1).

Re Russia: the "non-aggression pact" with Nazi Germany was significantly more than that, in that it included an agreement to carve up Poland. It could be said that in that campaign at least they were allies as they fought against a mutual enemy, and there was military (training especially) and logistical/supply (food & materiel transports) assistance bundled into the pact. In fact, supplies were still being sent from the USSR to Germany when Barbarossa began in June 1941. Ach!

You killed Church you team killing fucktard.  You kids with your damn lingo. Turn down, turn up. I don't understand. turn up for what? You disappoint me with your fake subs. You are from the internet so I believe you. We all read this in her voice.


Firing Main Cannon. Ah, the Zap Brannigan maneuver! Their KD was awful. TIL Russia's strategies are very similar to how I play battlefield Ah, the ole "Zapp Brannigan" strategem. It's a bold move Cotton. Seems like something a random German would want them to do... o rly? It really is. Then there's always one guy being salty about archers Fair enough. I'll check them out! Is anyone else hard right now? This gave me goosebumps  Aye... and the Brits dealt with a lot of weird, new, and terrifying methods of attack (such as the V2 program) and still held steadfast! Like, on an alter? for realsies?
 Churchill also hated Stalin and the USSR and wanted to preemptively drop a nuke on Russia. 

True store.  Churchill didn't own Scotland.True story. True story  The UK was founded in 1707.  Long after all of those invasions. England was only ever (fully) conquered once and that was by the the Normans. Otherwise areas of England were taken, but never the entirety. We then employed our secret weapon and absorbed the invaders, including aspects of their cultures that were beneficial and of course any technology they brought, also words/ideas from their language. Considering modern Britons have all those groups as ancestors I don't really know who you think "you guys" are. The last successful invasion of the British isles was the Norman invasion in fucking 1066.  I know it's an island, but if it's been almost 1600 years since you've been truly invaded, they must be doing something right. 

Edit: so apparently it's 2016 and not 2600. Unrelated question, anyone happen to see a delorean around?  That would be BRITAIN!!!!! > Nobody expected the German tanks to be able to pass through the Ardennes forest so easily.

Not even the Germans. Unimaginable warfare? Driverless cars bringing terminators in on our interstates, occupying the highways to control food and flow of people. The city can be occupied in hours with this tactic. While it was considered by the Belgians, that Germany would move trough Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands the French and English ignored their warnings. Swiss intelligence also detected several tank divisions and warned the French; who again ignored those warnings. Spot on, damn. Most of the "best units" like the BEF and Foreign Legion were preparing to take the fight to Germany in the Low countries. The french had the mentality that the second world War if there was one would be like the first. Long and static. They deployed their tanks (which at that time were considered pretty good, at least better then the light German tanks.) As supportive roles with infantry. Basically the Germans learned from the hell hole that was the western front during ww1, the french spent most their resources on outdated tactics while Germans developed new ones like Blitzkrieg. The french spent billions to make a super trench in alsace. Only time it was truly used was when the allies invaded france, the Germans occupied it and turned their defenses against them, ironically.

It's funny to think that while Germans were preparing for a blitz of Europe, the french had special rooms for their soldiers to get a nice tan in underground tanning rooms in the maginot line and plant flowers on the surface to keep up morale. I think the founding of Germany is the mark of the french militaries fall from prestige. It went like this.  Japan declared war on the U.S.---U.S. declared war on Japan---Germany declared war on U.S. ----U.S. declared war on Germany.   > More than two years in. 


The U.S. was fighting a proxy war funneling money and guns to the allies since the start. They just didn't send their troops until the end of the first 1/3 of the war. 
 You're thinking of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It was a 10 year non-aggression pact, but the main thing people usually talk about with it (other than Germany breaking it with Operation Barbarossa) is that it contained secret protocols where the two countries agreed to remain neutral if the other went to war with a another country, and they divided Finland, the Balkans, and Poland into German and Russian spheres of influence. Germany got Ostpreußen, Lithuania, and about a third of Poland, and the USSR got the rest of Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Finland.

So it's correct to say they had a non-aggression pact at the beginning of World War 2, but the practical reality was that they basically flat-out agreed that they were both about to engage in some imperialistic warfare, and they emboldened and helped each other by clarifying the boundaries in advance. Calling it just a non-aggression pact is downplaying the parts that were really important, and which were kept secret until after the war. Sort of. They negotiated a defensive pact and the carving up of Poland and the Baltic states just before the outbreak of war in Europe. Hitler needed to guarantee peace on his eastern flank while he attacked France, he also needed Russian grain to feed the Germans. Stalin lacked heavy machinery and weaponry to protect against Japan and to aid in their industrialisation, so got that in exchange. It was way more than just an old cease fire agreement. The reason they had a NAP was more then just to carve up territory. Yes they both wanted lost territory from the first world War, but they had made other arrangements much more historically significant. Stalin agreed to let the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe to test and develope combat vehicles in their territory, because the Versailles treaty didn't allow for Germany to do this at home. They basically found a loop hole, a secret loop hole that wasnt shared with the world at the time

 Stalin had his reasons too however, he had just purged his command structure (look up stains purges) and required time to recoup his losses. Basically they both new they'd end up fighting (Stalin was a little more optimistic to how soon it would come though) and needed time to revitalize their militaries. The Winter War is proof of how badly the purges effected the soviet army. You either turn down, for what? or turn up for yourself. Simple as that. Turn down for what? > [turn up for what?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnduejSdBI0) I read this and still clicked the link...... It's going to be a long day The problem with quotes from the internet you can never be certain of they're authentic. - Abraham Lincoln Yep, mostly because their Generals didn't give a shit about the soldiers, knowing there will be plenty to take their position. They ordered suicidal attacks, knowing they would send thousands of men into certain death, only to keep the Germans busy and break through somewhere else. Stalin actively encouraged that behaviour with his Order 227 "No Step Back". Also, their industry was pretty basic and couldn't support such a large army; they relied heavily on Lend-Lease shipments from the USA.  Yeah I play the same way, I keep throwing myself into way over extended positions where I know I'm gunna die and just try to thin them out enough for a push through Yis rly Neither port was supported very well, nor are they available on steam and they require some work to get running on a modern PC. Hope these links help!

So like China ?  You are borg... We are the true, pure, throughbred race of germanic/celtic/Scandinavian/latin people that are the brittish!

IN THE NAME OF THE EMPRESS! ROYAL MEHREEEENS! 2016-1066=1600 years? I think you're forgetting about the Kalaxian infiltration during the 3rd Amalthean Congress in 2366.  Just because they were mind-controlling insects, and managed to take over in secret doesn't mean it wasn't a successful invasion. i'm confused by your math RULE BRITANNIA!!!! Turn down, turn up? What is so simple about this!?!?! Are we in space, which has no direction!?!!?!?! I don't understand your code! U know what skool i went 2 m8? I kinda hate you random internet stranger. I kind of felt the same kind of "did that really just happen?" when I pulled the Xbox1 + Fifa sticker off of my McDonald's drink. Still didn't really believe it even when I went and punched the sucker into the web address to claim the prize.

It really only sunk in when it showed up in the mail 6 weeks later, had it for almost 8 months now - 15 minutes in Fifa.  My mom once had 32 winning tickets for a Wii contest from ToysRUs.  We only won a single one though because they were all under the same address.  Had we used family and friends addresses we would have had 32 free Wiis when they were super hyped.   The first screencap of the Twitter message is a bit misleading. It didn't come out of nowhere; the official DOOM Twitter page was having a giveaway where if you retweeted one of their posts, you got entered to win a custom Xbox One or PS4. I retweeted, but really didn't expect at all to win. that probably put you in a good MooD Congrats! My saddest ever story was when I was 11-ish, I entered to win one of Nickelodeon's online sweepstakes, and got selected as the runner-up which was still a HUGE load of toys. The sad part is, being 11, I never checked my e-mail. So by time I opened it, I had passed the "Respond by [date] to claim your prize!" 

I think it was a Star Wars giveaway, or something. I just remember being crushed that I didn't check my e-mail in time. 

Now I check it too frequently.  This kind of thing happens all the time to people. Other people. I'm happy for you, but angry at you. Makes me wonder how many [MASSIVE YACHTS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsYoeoEE3ww) ive missed out on... I once won a contest on youtube from a guy named soldierknowsbest. It was for a brand new iphone 4 and he would ship it launch day to the winner and I love tech so I was super pumped. The winner had to guess a number from 1 to 10,000 and the first one to comment the number he chose won the phone. I asked my mom to tell me a number randomly and she told me the winning number and the next day I woke up to hundreds of emails of youtube messages from people saying i hate you, go die, youre so lucky or congrats. Then there was one person who scammed me of it. He created a fake channel that looked exactly like the the guy who ran the contest and asked me to send my username and password so he can upload a video to my channel confirming it was me. I was young and naive so I gave my information until I realized i was no longer able to get into my account becuase my password was incorrect and he changed my backup email to his own email(This was back when youtubes password policies were horrible). I was locked out of my account and tried sending emails to myself asking for the account back but he then had control of my hotmail and youtube. Ultimatly i eventually got my account back about 2 months later after contacting youtube for what seemed like a centuery with horrible customer service and when I finally got back in I saw his messages where he recived the iphone instead of me. That day I lost a little bit of faith in humanity and to be honest as lame as it sounds I have never got it back. Ok I need to know - is this someone trying to lull us into falling for scams, or have I been missing out on random prizes for like years and years?! Grats man!^(alright maybe I do hate you a little) hey its me ur brother The last thing I won was a copy of Fallout for the Mac in like 1997. My dad won me a PS3 from a national sprite campaign back in 2010, the console was green with a giant sprite logo on it. I never thought to upload pictures but I can if anyone is interested. 

EDIT: Here is the pic http://imgur.com/DUL3JAy Why do people keep hanging up on us? Do they not want one of our MASSIVE YACHTS? Really....never happens to me. Though i did win this cool little sushi pen the other day, but that was only after consuming like 30+ plates so Idk if id count that.  You son of a bitch Reveal yourself you bot piece of shit! I feel ya! I won a GTX 1080 from nVidia couple weeks ago. Should show up in a few weeks :) Haha, that message looks like every scam message too, I'd be kind of hesitant to receive that this shit does happen. i entered a twitter contest to meet my favorite Major League Soccer team  New York Red Bulls and i won. met the entire team and spoke to each player. it was incredible. All these chicks adding me to flirt on Skype. I need to stop blocking them as spam. 99 percent sure this is just viral marketing If it didn't happen to people who else would it happen to? I loved doom since 1990 Enjoy it, best FPS thats come out in YEARS Still don't believe it, send it to me for inspection... m'astroturfin Does... does he know he's an ad? I wonder which # winner you were that finally clicked "I Accept!"

:P

I also wonder how many people will see this & think to themselves "Crap, I should have accepted that!" I haven't won something like this since I was a kid. Happy Meals used to have these clip out things on the boxes where you'd mail it in and win a prize, I won Sonic 3 which was a huge deal to me back then! They had entered a contest though. If it is a prize for a contest they never entered, then I'd assume scam. Weird though, cause most contest forms ask for all that info from the start. Get the fuck out of here. It's a ploy!
 Yea, it does happen...buddy of mine who doesn't game won it. It's currently his Youtube / Netflix streaming device. 0 games. Sounds about right. I wonder how many cruises, flights, and random goods I've missed out on because I assumed I was being scammed. [Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/570/) Congratulations!

(As she said this with bitter disdain...) You can't play Doom without a mouse. Good try Microsoft Nice try Doom PR team I won a gold ps4 my first attempt with the free code when I saw a post on reddit about it. Its so surreal winning shit like this. Dude. Nice! Back in the day a Microsoft force feedback joystick and Mech Worrier CD showed up on my front porch from some contest I don't remember ever entering. So- yeah, it happens. Still doesn't beat winning a game boy color from the inside of a lunchable  The trick to spotting the real one.

Notice they didn't ask for any credit card information? Congrats dude! Is that blood? If you entered the contest, you entered the contest.

If you didn't enter the contest, have fun with your Nigerian prince. They couldn't have sounded more like a scam to me, honestly. Good for you! It does happen! I entered a contest via twitter to win tickets to E3, thinking there was no chance. Well I ended up going to E3 this year and it was pretty sweet.  I once won a Coke can radio... I drink Pepsi :( Last year a Bungie employee read a comment I made on the DTG subreddit and gave me a free collectors edition of The Taken King. It was pretty dope, I had never gotten anything like that before.  I'm still waiting on that Ipad for being the 10,000 visitor.  Doom's marketing department thanks you for this service. It's a trap.  I both hate you and want to be you. It's sad that we live in a world that makes me think you're nuts for giving your name and address to a stranger.  Sell it, you'd get good money Oh wow, congratulations for sucking out the rest of the world's luck! I once won a stamp with my name on it. The highlight of my life. The only thing I ever won was the genetic lottery of being born a white male... I had a similar awesome experience from Old Spice. They sent me over $3000 worth of taxidermy animals and shampoo. Want to start a club with me?  Congrats to that winner. When I was about 9 or 10 years old, I won the grand prize for the Sonic the Hedgehog Spaghettios contest. The back of the label would have three scratch off circles. I scratched to reveal "Grand Prize". I shit my pants on the spot (I'm sure  Spaghettio consumption had something to do with it). So I claim the prize with the help of my parents. A month or two later I come home from school to find a delivery in my living room. I freaked out with excitement and my mom, although happy for me, reminded me that they had to pay somewhere between $300-400 in taxes on it and that I better appreciate it. I think that is the first time I really took a second to think about goddamn taxes. It was an arcade style cabinet, but in two pieces. The bottom piece was simply a stand and the top had two metal tubes arching up the front. It had a small tv and underneath that a plexiglass window with a Genesis inside and a copy of Sonic. Genesis controller stuck out the front on a wire bracket for support. So I guess it wasn't a real arcade machine, just an arcade cabinet with a tv and a console. But who is complaining. I was in love and felt like the luckiest Damn kid in the world. Had to wait for my dad to come home from work to carry it upstairs and help set it up. 

Long story short, I got a lot of use out of it. I hosted many sleepovers And my friends loved it. I'd say I got about 4 or 5 good years of fun out of it. However, as time went on, it didn't get touched for a couple years or so. Still young and stupid as FUCK, i figured since it was just collecting dust, that I would move it downstairs into the basement. But being the impatient piece of shit I am, I decided on such a better alternative. See, I would have to wait a few hours until my dad came home from work to help bring it downstairs. But brilliantly, I figured out the easiest way to do it myself... Strip all usable parts from it and dismantle it. I dismantled it with a hammer. I destroyed it. I killed my love with a hammer and carried the broken pieces to the garbage. 

To this day, it was one of my biggest regrets (guess I'm lucky to be able to say that). It is a great story for My friends to bust My balls about because of how much regret I have. My mom used to like coming around when I'd have friends over in the recent past and say, "hey, remember when you used to have that Sonic Arcade machine you won off a Spaghettios can?". My friends would lose it every time and openly mock me from there. Jokes on me. I am shameful. Shame me. Shame. 

Shame.

Shame.

Shame... Congrats!! Its a good feeling. Please dont go chasing that feeling because you wont get it when you want it. For me it all started with a $5 scratcher... I hate you and I hate this. *Hides Post*. Hey, it's me your brother I won a Fallout 4 Xbox one last fall during the Enter the Vault Sweepstakes. It definitely feels like a scam when you get the e-mail saying you won. Congrats OP! Tomorrow on Craigslist.  Hey it's me your father 4 years ago one Russian website had a giveaway of Apple TV right before the new iPhone autumn announce conference. To participate you needed to predict the time length of the conference in comments. I picked up something like 1:52:37 and was just 2 seconds wrong which made me the winner. Still don't understand how that was possible.  CONGRATULAYIONS, YOUVE BEEN SELECTED TO RECIEVE A FREE IPOD NANO Back near the launch of the Nintendo 3DS, I entered one of those sketchy-looking unofficial raffles on a Facebook page to win a Nintendo 3DS. Couple of weeks later, they sent me free a Nintendo 3DS on launch day. how much did you pay the Nigerian price for import fees?  Congrats!  I won a PS4 from taco bell about a year ago.  I remember not believing I was actually going to get one until it showed up.   When I was in college and colleghumor was the place to be they had a list a giveaways and freebies. I would enter my name in them, not expecting much until I got a call back from American Idol. I didn't call back right away because I thought there was no way it was real. Then they called again... Here's what I won-

A limo ride to and from the airport, round trip airline tickets for me and a friend, tickets to the final 3 of American idol, a hotel in Hollywood and $200 spending cash!

19 year old me was on top of the world! Never won anything since... Probably won't again.. This was like 13 or 14 years ago, season 2 of American Idol I remember i won a contest for watchdogs on xbox 360 like 2 years ago and i was like yaaay omg Fake. Mail it to me or it didn't happen. Finally some good karma for hooking me up with all that acid.  I just poopfarted. Your post makes me happy.

Though *my* luck is crappy,

I hope you have fun,

with what you have won,

cuz I didn't win an RX 480. Confirmed: DOOM is FPS for casuals. PCMR Bruh Nice try doom marketing team Researcher to xbox one executive, "Here's the new doombox." Researcher "That's fine, just set it on the floor there.""Now all i do is type a note to myself, screenshot, anddddd boom!.. I can uncheck [   ] *rig the giveaway* from my mental to-do list! Sponsors are happy, but not as happy as Debbie from accounting will be when i give this to her son. She really knows how to crunch my numbers. One of my best friends won an all expense paid trip for four from UPS. He didn't send in his info fast enough (~48hrs), and so they gave the prize to someone else... i'm just so happy.....that to see a post about a contemporary system and game.  I wish this post well against the sea of check out my old nintendo dudes posts. This seemed pretty dang cool until I saw the second image and was like "oh fuck, i didn't even enter! I want this!"
 Don't play it after midnight. Sometimes, Twitter is amazing. I've won a $300 Moto 360 package, a couple $50 phone cases and a signed Robert Kirkland 'Walking Dead' volume 20. 

Hooray for retweets!  its me ur brother I won a copy of SpyFox from dairy queen once, does that count?  A few years back, my friend's brother actually won one of those Taco Bell Playstation 4 promo things. I forget which game came with it, but still. What the fuck.  very cool
 Congrats! Is there anything similar to this skin for purchase? Did you enter for it? The most I've ever won was an avatar t shirt :/ Congrats! So lucky but you probably deserve it. Have fun! A few months before Arkham Asylum came out I got really hyped and into the games forums. I don't remember all the details but there was some kind of hidden trail on the website that included other websites that were related to the game. If I remember correctly this trail lead to different recordings of the riddler and puzzles and stuff. Well one day after months of doing these weird things related to this awesome game I was hyped about I got an email from rocksteady saying I was one of the first 100 people in the world to finish these puzzles and reach the end of the trail. They sent me a free collectors edition for whichever console I wanted. I had already pre-ordered the collectors edition and ended up with 2 haha. I still have both of the cool batshaped containers they came in somewhere.  That's fucking RAD. How i got my ipad! Filled out the info, got it in the mail, my ma wondered what the hell it was doing here, i told her... im still not sure if she believes it. I won an Xbox One from Yahoo for creating the nicest looking android launcher called Aviate. I was so shocked I have never heard of anyone actually winning these things and thought they were rigged but it turns out they're legit sometimes! Congrats. Makes you wonder how many people didn't accept.  I wouldn't have and out of ignorance I would have been fine with it until you posted this fucking shit.  You're an asshole. oh man, congratulations!

those prizes are once in a lifetime, it seems... 1000% jelly as fuck.


Nice haul op! :) Are you sure you're people? I won a frisbee once. I knew it! I have a lot of online surveys to fill out when I get home! I like that custom console!

Awesome for the signed copy too! Oh lord are you ever in for a treat. You've just won...[A MASSIVE YACHT!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdi6E-qzS1c) Can confirm this sort of thing.  Won a PSP sweepstake from McDonalds when I was in high school.  The fine print required the winner to turn in their big mac box with the winning number - but I had thrown away the box and wrote the number on a napkin since the box was covered in ketchup .  Thought they weren't going to honor the number but they came through. I'm so envious. DOOM looks sick, but I just want the XBONE :( Congratulations though bro :) Dos Equis Gave me a trip to New Orleans from NYC. Put me and frend for flight and swanky hotel. A oub crawl with tons of free food beer and parties all weekend.  It was amazing.   Doom is an awesome game too.. congrats :).. so where was that chat screenshot taken?  This is how I got my Xbox one last year. I randomly entered a contest that was held on a website that I use to track Black Friday deals.  I missed the two confirmation emails they sent me telling me I won, luckily i caught the third and final one. Its actually a box full of spoons i won a 42" tv once from an online contest with a local am radio station I tried so damn hard to win a 1080 from nvidia during their E3 contest... haha

Congrats dude can imagine how happy you'd be What if the xbox was hacked to record the information he inputs and transfer it to some hacker? Credit card numbers and other information for the price of one custom Xbox One. You badass. I opened my reddit app, and see a picture I got personally snap chatted to me earlier today on the front page. My man, u/ahriik.  Nice try, DOOM marketing team! "I do not want this prize..." 
 I somehow tried to click "I accept!" after reading. I was in grade 3 when I won one of [these electronic Beyblade lunchers](http://img0106o.psstatic.com/155849171_2002-hasbro-beyblade-electronic-driger-launcher-shooter-.jpg) from YTV (a kids TV channel) and I was blown away that I had actually won something that probably hundreds of kids entered for. Always knew about those contests but never heard anything about the winners.  Plot twist: this is actually the start of a /r/nosleep story. It looks used and is covered in stains.  hey its me, your Nigerian brother-Prince doom is a badass game.   ppl should play it more! Fuck you lucky bastard  I once got an email about winning a $500 Amazon gift card. I did in fact do a survey that could net me the card, but I was super skeptical, so I asked him to confirm a public piece of information on that website. He said he wasn't actually associate with the site, they were an advertising company, so he couldn't.

I gave him a really old email I no longer use. Turned out it was legit. I was stoked. Only thing in my life I ever won. i once entered a contest for "Darkstar Skateboards" where it was to see who had the best tattoo of a guy who looks closest to their logo(which was a knight looking guy) so since i didnt have a tattoo of that I of course googled it, submitted it, came home one day from school and a package with a deck, tape, stickers galore (etc) !!! I won an iPad once just by downloading an app. Needless to say, I was shocked  How long before you were thoroughly convinced it wasn't some sort of fake scam? I would take it straight to the pawn shop. Isn't it just amazing how one picture can make a human angry?  I bet it's full of worms though. These things don't happen. OP must have entered a draw somehow. This reminds me of last year when Taco Bell was doing PS4 giveaways. One of my friends was able to win a gold one and ever since then I've been trying my luck with sweepstakes. So far I've been unsuccessful but I haven't lost faith yet.  Even as a PC gamer I envy that Xbox just because of the way it looks Those bloodstains look so fuckin cool on that! Lucky you!  Nioce  Man! this is my favorite post I have come across today. To congratulate you, I will send a 24 carrot platinum-diamond-Jesus's Skin military carrier. All I need is your home address, your credit card number, the amount of siblings you do/don't have, your car and house keys, your social security, your penis size, the size of your back mular on the left and your great grandmother's gold fish's fish food brand. Thats awesome, did you just reply to that email with the exact information they asked? And you just received it a few days later? *Damn, I gotta get back to that Nigerian prince* Throw it away, it isn't real. Had to look twice and make sure this wasn't /r/scams Even with all those signatures, I'd still use the reversible art lol ... Aaaaaand then they break in and steal all your stuff one week later I bet it's a cardboard box. Dude I would think of it as spam and delete it. Nice, congrats! I won an Xbox One and Forza from the Doritos/Mountain Dew contest a couple years ago. I won my Nexus 6p a similar way. Love it. Best phone I've had. This is probably the most compelling reason I've seen in quite some time to buy a console. That looks freaking awesome. I generally have no luck at these things however, I remember entering a competition for an nvidea graphics card about 8 years ago, forgot all about it. couple of months go by and I get an email saying you've won! I start thinking this is a scam but, I needed a new gfx card and I thought what the hell I'm a broke student, emailed my address over and then forgot about it. Month later a package arrives from the states. 

Let it be a lesson to all you doubters, sometimes good things happen! I wonder how many free consoles or video cards I've deleted from my inbox?? I once one a Samsung Behold 2, one of the first Android phones, in an internet giveaway by Samsung. At first I thought it was a scam, but it wasn't. Internet giveaways are rare, but some are legit. i love you random internet stranger. ...but do you like gaming consoles? I know right? I'm not the least bit jealous...nope, not one bit. ^^^ihateyouOP love u  Fake internet stranger * I hate you. 6 weeks? Why so long? When I was 13 (now 27) I went to Cedar Point with my sister and her boyfriend.  The boyfriend got lost on the way there and after driving around aimlessly for an hour (this was before smartphones and mainstream gps) we stopped at a random McDonalds in the middle of farmland to get some food.  It was still breakfast and I ordered an extra hashbrown with my meal.  That extra hashbrown that I paid $0.50 for, at a McDonalds in the middle of no where that we had just so happened to stop at while being completely lost, had a "You Win $100" Monopoly sticker on it.  Couldn't believe I won and didn't really believe it until McDonalds sent me a check in the mail 4 weeks later.  $100 to 14 year old me was a lot of money.  It was like $1000 to 27 year old me. I just realized I never saw a single sticker on my McDonald's drink. Fuck. They never did it to begin with in my hometown. I got a free Xbox and didn't even have to buy McDonalds.  Fifth grade me convinced my mom to buy a raffle ticket for school charity.  I convinced myself I could win the n64 bundle they were giving away. No way my parents would ever drop that much money on a new game console it was the only choice.  Weeks go by and then one day I get called to the office. Whole class does the typical ooooooooo, I'm scared because I've never been in trouble in school. Walk the whole way imagining how bad my dad is going to beat me for whatever I did wrong. Get to the office and they hand me a n64 in a nice basket with two controllers and King Griffy Jr. Baseball. Best day of my childhood. I can still here the opening song after all these years because we couldn't afford another game for a long time. My older brother and I spent hours a day playing that game and we don't even like baseball.  lmao 32 Wii's like what the fuck would you do with all those  I used to work a few of these contests for free raffles. You would be surprised at how little people actually fill out the tickets. I had once 13 bikes to give away. 7 went to different families and we shared the other 5 against winners who showed up with an additional child in tow. 

Literally only 7 entries for 13 bikes
 What was the contest? How did she win 32 times? When walmart first opened in our area( back in the 90's?) They were giving away a mountain bike and a 60in projection tv (the ones that a big and take up most of the room)

My mom bought one ticket for each. (Different drawings)

She won both.

Then our hunting club (about 200+ members) held a raffle for a homemade quilt.

She bought 1 ticket.

She won.

Only two raffles she ever entered. Laws about contest giveaways are pretty strict. I hope your mom checked to make sure screwing you out of the other 31 was legal. Hello, lucky person. I am a Prince of royalty in my home country of Nigeria and if you send me this Xbax 1 and Doom Gaem I will send you one millen dallars. Oh. 

I didn't realize it was a Twitter message. The way it's framed, it looks like your reply is a button you had to click and it was some kind of pop-up, which makes it look sketchy as hell.  [deleted] Congrats!! That had to feel awesome! Congrats. I've won Twitter contests twice. Once from Harmonix for a Rock Band 2 guitar signed by Green Day, and another from Nintendo for a copy of Mario Party 10. You never actually expect to win, but it's pretty exhilarating if you do.  Can confirm this happens. I won a WiiU + 5 games the same way last christmas. The sad part is I burnt my chances of winning anything again. I would have thought that one was ovbious lol  I was gonna say, you gave your info to a random Twitter giveaway? This makes way more sense  Once entered into Top Gear's "Worst Car" story or whatever it was called at the time on Twitter. Had no expectations to win and thought my story would be dismissed because it genuinely seems like I'm making it up, but it really did happen at the time (drove my parents' minivan and anytime you'd turn on the AC the car would shut down momentarily or completely). 

I ended up getting a Stig alarm clock and a note from the BBC thanking me for entering. Too bad this stroke of luck didn't happen for us with the Powerball! Nice dude Congrats! You got gold for saying congrats!  You made me go check my email in hopes of something. I was offered for a business expansion loan for a business i don't have! woohoo! Moral of the story: Check your email every day, twice a day, just in case you won a Nickelodeon sweepstake... sweepstakes? Is there a single form of the word?? Other people just outnumber person by too much :( Person never stands a chance Upon receiving this prize, my identity has been revoked and I'm left to wander the world simply known as "other people." We can't all act like we won the lottery and then praise the lottery company like they cared. Dude, that fucking sucks. It didn't happen to me and it hurts. Sorry man.  Let's find this punk and take his balls away so he can't spawn any more scum onto the Earth.

Had a guy steal my iPhone once, and have the stupidity to ask me for money to get it back.
I used find my iPhone and got my phone back and sent that punk right back to jail.
Best justice boner I ever had. That's shitty, but at least it was a relatively inexpensive way to learn that lesson. I bet you won't be giving out your password to any internet randos anytime soon So you know the thief's address? Also, did you contact the guy who gave the phone away? If they're through official accounts and major companies like this one was, you should be fine  The potential *millions of dollars in free PR* which come from the person winning this prize and then posting it on social media far outweighs the few hundred dollars at risk by companies who do this sort of thing.

There's a reason they make these offers on social media. People who post to win them are often fairly active on social media, which means that not only will they probably post to social media when they win, they will also likely have a pretty sizable number of followers. Even a couple dozen followers increases the chance of a "I won a thingie!" tweet going viral.

So, for the cost of a console (let's say 200 bucks, since they probably got it cheap because Microsoft also gets advertising. Max is cost of console + customized skin. 500 or so) plus the cost of a physical copy of the game (essentially nothing to them), they get functionally guaranteed advertisement to a few dozen people. With only a few percent "I see this I want it" rate, that means at least two systems bought for Microsoft, and probably three or four games sold for id. Then you factor in "Wow, I saw this on a hashtag" sharing, and you've got easily a couple thousand people seeing a winner's post. Well giveaways are about marketing mostly and with a few exceptions the publicity at places like Reddit more than pays for the cost nowadays. What's the name of the farm next to the Hill House? I won a lollipop in 5th grade once...  Ok wheres the pic DOOOOO IT Op pls We interested bro. Op pls  Your upvote is being held hostage until you deliver the goods WHERE IS IT Interested  justdoitplease They wanted you to sign the check and give it back.  [:D](http://i.imgur.com/hCc2zew.jpg) Wtf how? That's the best thing ever. Posted by _DoomMarketingTeam_ "This asshole thinks he's just too good to accept free gaming consoles, tablets, TVs, and 18 year old girls in his area!"  You beat me to it. this should be higher Don't worry, they're both gross Don't worry, I used to play Magic: The Gathering.

*... just one...more...pack* Hey dad, when are you coming back from the gas station picking up cigarettes?  Thanks me too  Oh man, if I had won both this AND the 480??? Could be a lizard, but I'm pretty sure I'm people ;) ;) that's what I'm saying man! I love you all

Edit: RIP inbox Now kith And I love you random citizen. Hey its me your brother.  Yes? I couldn't justify spending money on one but I like them. Not a fan of game exclusivity.  /r/nothingeverhappens Free giveaways do not have free 2 day shipping ;) I won a galaxy tab once (one of the shit ones) from a coca cola competition once. Had a big runaround to verify that I was actually me, had to get a justice of the peace to notarize my letter saying that I am in fact me. Still worth it, sold it for $250 a week later :-) Possibly cause they know the person probably won't complain since it's free That game was amazing when I was a kid. My cousin and I would play that pretty much the whole time I visited.  > Whole class does the typical ooooooooo

Ahh, memories. What a feel good story. You should make it a children's book.. with pictures! Hi, I'm Ken Griffy Jr. Let's play major league baseball.  That's so cool! How was the reaction from your parents? >King Griffy

I read that as King Joffrey the first time.  
I would have hit that baseball as it was on the ground so often if it was. xD > Walk the whole way imagining how bad my dad is going to beat me

Looks at username.

Isn't /u/rogersimon10 Is your name Charlie and do you have plans on visiting a chocolate factory? Call me call me call me jnr Hahaha, King Griffey Jr......the royal baseball edition. Betcha walked back to class like mr big dick on campus  I found running into the wall highly entertaining. BASE Call, call, call me Griffey! That's the best theme song.  Was there really a game called king Griffy jr. Baseball or are you not a sports person? In 4th grade I entered to win a bike. Got the bike.

A year later I ran into a garage door and broke the handlebars off. They chose a baseball game? Mario 64 was the obvious choice. You could go WiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWiiWii all the way home. Sell em Bragging rights Make a wii fort. Yeah, back then they were selling on ebay for like $500 a pop because everywhere was sold out... partially due to people buying them to keep them out of stock so they can successfully flip them for $500 a pop.

I can't seem to find that. 1 million Zimbabwe Dollars?  I accept! How many psn codes have you gotten? Lol that's how I think of it too. If you join giveaways for your entire life you're bound to win something big at some point but once you do you've basically lucked out With this post, OP has unwittingly mislead thousands of people into thinking those random 90's banner ads are legit. Nice DooD*

FTFY But you didn't. And neither will I. Lol, as surprised as you! I have gotten gold once in my life. It was for some long text I wrote when I was high af. I guess normal me isn't cool enough to get gold. I got Penis pills! That's nothing, you won't believe how much cash I could get from PPI Yeah, he also emailed me once he got the phone saying that he loved hit and it sucks to be me... Horrible human being Lmao I'm glad to hear that, find my iPhone is the best thing apple has done in years Trump. I won a calculator in church once. Pitchforks at the ready boys. Since OP doesn't deliver, I guess I'll try my best.

Either you deliver  a photo of that carved into your dick or it didn't happen.  I feel really bad for ignoring all of those girls who were lonely and putting themselves out there. How selfish of me. You just made me see if people had youtube channels opening MTG packs. Yep. Then I watched a dude open an alpha black lotus. Yep. Then I was on ebay looking at alpha booster packs. Yeah... See this is what happens You'd have to give back to the universe in a big way by donating blood or... organs? Shut it sarah [fuck off Sarah](https://youtu.be/eRdnbdS6TNQ?t=15s) Now kith Love you too <3 YES. I LOVE YOU ALL AS WELL.  I love you too Confirmologist here, can confirm. Username checks out stop being so nice asshole Dad? It's pronounced METRO CITY I just bitterly dropped $50 on a used 360 b/c mine RRoD'ed. Super shitty to spend $300+ on a console knowing there's a dice roll that it might just crash one day. Downvoted for answering an opinion based question. Good going reddit.  I'm not either, halo should be on play station and uncharted should be on Xbox! I'm not even joking. [Got the message on Monday](http://i.imgur.com/VEfQbHG.png), shipped out on Tuesday, got it today (Thursday).  I won a PS4 Destiny bundle from Taco Bell early on a Tuesday Morning and it was on my doorstep at noon on Thursday. Great game. I gave up many runs  because I would purposely crash into the wall instead of trying to catch the ball. It was too damn funny and too groundbreaking to NOT do it. I would play it with my cousin when he visited. That's so awesome. I remember when the ps2 came out I mowed lawns in my neighborhood for months saving up. When I got back from camp that summer my dad had payed for half of it and surprised me. I played the demo disc it came with to the ground. In high school, can confirm they still do that. A book? Don't be ridiculous. No child of mine reads. No, it needs to be released as a series of Facebook games.  I'd leave out the part about dad beating you though. I can't see many children's publishers going for that. He said King... Maybe *this* was the Nigerian prince They were completely blown away. The newest console we had in the house was an NES we picked up with 50 games at a pawnshop years earlier. Eventually even my dad got excited about it once we found some games we both enjoyed later on.  We usually picked a game for the family to share every christmas after that until the end of the n64's lifespan.  Hey, that's actually 32. Damnit, this actually made me laugh During launch, selling 32 Wiis would've made you a millionaire. The demand for Wiis was unreal. You *don't* own 32 wii's? You would have to be a wii man to fit in a wii fort. It's a beautiful thing, isn't it? I flipped both a PS4 and an Xbox One right at release, making a profit of $150 total. All of your Nigerian royalty that email me beg to differ.  The emails are intentionally written in poor English to weed out people with half a brain.  Your brethren all call me "dear". Featuring:  **Sanic and the Secret Rangs** I sent him one once Damn it, golden opportunity lost :( Prinny Such is life.  Now he *has* gotten gold. Now you're wrong. Nice try though!
 Yeah, I know right :( sorry about that, man. Who had sex in there? THREE HOURS LATER:

No sign of OP. Have sharpened my pitchfork to bone-piercing badassness. One more hour, I think. . . Where can I buy one? Its just not the same coming from you... 😳 Damn it Sarah That's not Sarah. That's why it's Sarah_loves_you_all, not I_love_you_all. Suck it Sarah Hey it's me Sarah Shh bby I don't remember this scene from the books... Same thing with every electrical device though buddy I think it was more 'answering a rhetorical question,' than it was "answering an opinion based question" (heh, that's a very sideways way of conveying your message) 

But he's into positives now, anyway!  Soooo... Free giveaways do have 2-day shipping.  Taco Bell is higher, fine dining. This means you will get a much more premium shipping service. I always wondered if I'd ever meet a winner of that bundle.  I ate a lot of Taco Bell to get that.  Probably enough to more than pay for the bundle.  I'm actually kinda mad at you right now.   I bought the box a few times in order to win. There were several boxes that would not work... even after exchanging several behind the counter. Felt like a cheat. Wall-breaking

FTFY Until the end of the n64s lifespan? 



So you're telling my you are still playing it? r/theydidthemath

 Thank you for counting that for me  They could've made ten grand easy, and that's if they severely undercut the average price. Former Gamestop employee, can confirm Fuckin casuals man... [Wow, you must be rich!](http://i.imgur.com/4O0j2Xg.png) Wii fit in a wii fort. My friend paid me and 8 other friends $150 each to stand in line for 360's. I thought he was a fucking moron.

Then he sold them for $1,000 EACH on fucking eBay and I realized I was the dumbass. [deleted] No, they beg for money. They are intentionally poorly written to ensure only stupid people actually reply to them. Saves the scammers a lot of time.  I feel sorry for the real Nigerian prince that can't get anyone to take him seriously. So, one of my neighbors (I live in California) is an executive for a Nigerian telecom. When the "nigerian prince" scams started going around and became a meme he was super confused at first. People would make jokes, he wouldn't get it and would be moderately upset. His son was around my age and told me about it, we shared a laugh. They do this to get around spam filters :P  That must also get rid of Pina Colada hating, rain avoiding, yoga lovers. When I found that out, I sat back in my chair in astonishment, at that moment I realised that SPAM is a probably a billion dollar "industry", and they know their target market just like every other business. I think the whole Nigerian with a million dollars part does that pretty well on its own.  Back in 2001/2 I was standing at the fax machine with a part owner of the company I worked for and there was one of those faxes in the tray. I jokingly read part of it and said something like "it takes a special kind of stupid to fall for this...hahah". Then the owner explained that his father/founder of the company had done just that and lost around $50k. I felt like an ass but he was cool about it. Of course a few years later at the same company I rationalizes out loud that the CFO must have pictures of the CEO "blowing a goat" because of all the stuff he got away with. That one didn't go so well and they went ahead and wrote my letter of resignation for me.  Hey dear
 And Dankey Kang I keep reading this and laughing harder and harder. I'm wiping away a tear. I don't understand why this, why now, but I'm going to save it for when I need to laugh again.  I too "Dis gay ah" But I bet I will. BALL IS LIFE Hillary. OP only has 8 minutes left. Should we go ahead? Spell your name right sarah. Classic Sarah.  You've been promoted to lead detective on this case The difference between a McDonald's promo and a DOOM promo. Taco Bell was the only restaurant to survive the franchise wars. Now all restaurants are Taco Bell.  To rub more salt in the wound, I won it on my first try. I forgot to enter the code the night I bought the food and ended up entering it when I woke up the next morning at about 5:30.  Actually yes I still play it with my siblings when I go visit my Mom. I'll be putting a few hours in this weekend. A few Christmases ago when the first Guitar Hero for 360 came out, they were in such high demand that you couldn't find the guitars ANYWHERE. My family and I were at Walmart one day a few weeks before Christmas and happened to see an employee rolling out a pallet of probably 30 guitar / game combos. We asked and the guy said there was no limit on how many we could buy, so we bought the entire pallet of them. We put them on eBay for like $120 a piece, which was still a big markup from the I think $80 list price, but the next lowest seller had them for like $200 a piece. We sold all 30 within minutes, making over $1200...that was an amazing Christmas. 

Oh and the employee said they just got a huge shipment of them, so it wasn't like we bought out their entire inventory or anything.  Sure, your friend benefited more, but 150$ is solid income even if you had to wait there for 10 hours. Yep, I expected to make a lot more with the newest gen, but little did I know. I was lucky to even make as much as I did.  I beg your pardon. That's definitely not true for most of them. I've been scambaiting these 419 scammers for over a decade now off and on. And these guys think they speak just fine. They also don't realize talking with all caps is bad. The majority of these guys are just really really dumb. And I mean REALLY dumb.  particularly the ones that wanna cheat on each other but it turns out they're pretty okay together If u lik makin luv @ midnite... You seem to be a tad bit dumb Uhhhhh... https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/b2/3c/21/b23c21aac00d1ca465d5065ca940960a.jpg That's on WiiU retard. Check'em.   Holy shit. Congratulations, fellow pie. Must have been some damn good pie.  Beautiful naked big titted women just don't fall out of the sky you know﻿. Holy fuck this actually got gold.  I really have to look up what getting/giving gold entails.  

Edit: Neat!  And I will follow suit. I know i won't  YOU SON OF A BEECH I also as well gold too... shit Nah, nobody ever wins these things  IT'S TIME BRAH.

FLAMING PITCHFORKS! 4 hrs post challenge, OP has failed, that's too slow for reddit, even if OP does eventually come through with pics.  Pitch forks can officially be used on OP. 

edit: How does this work exactly?  I've never used my pitchfork before. But Sarah is the only correct spelling  It's Sara with no "h" cause "h's" are ew! The butler did it! Open and shut case. Maybe she's one of those "talk in the third person" type people.

"Sarah's hungry!"

"Sarah likes to watch American Idol!"

"Sarah got a promotion today!" McDonald's probably waits for the entire promo to end before they ship prizes.  They forced the use of the 3 shells just to fuck with us. Is that a south park reference? That makes me happy, those things never die. And why didn't you buy their entire inventory? Easy money ;) Man, what a dick move... That's called scalping and it's kind of fucked up, lol. "A few"

Eleven. Eleven Christmases ago. *deep internal sobbing* Risk free too. Oh for sure. But I didn't think he would be able to sell them for $150 over retail. He did the same fucking thing with the Wii. [deleted] I beg for Reddit gold. Sheesh First for Snowden, then maybe consider you. Are you from Canada? > I've been scambaiting these 419 scammers for over a decade

So you're a master baiter?

Seriously though, thanks for the good work. Scam baiting reports are some of the most hilarious things I've come across. You're not the first person to tell me that after hearing the story. My wife was the first when I called her on the way home to tell her why I was coming home early. But hey, my mom thinks "I'm special" so I've got that going for me. Good story tho  I'm surely doing something wrong on Reddit. Wait really? MFW I check'em http://imgur.com/ArNOC0D [your dubs are checked](http://imgur.com/5yiwGab) WITNESSED!

...Nice. and there's probably a disclaimer about that somewhere I haven't watched for years, but if they said it, it was a reference to Demolition Man. Which is a fantastic movie to watch when you're hammered.  Maybe 'cause that would have been a major Richard Relocation. How'd you have enough to buy them all lol Here you are, stranger.  Sorry, too far up the line. Truu A month old account?

You are a very strange individual  As soon as I saw the ducks I knew... Wtf.. a rubber duck sexual fetish?? How does that even work? How do you keep getting the same one? Is it not random This guy is a fucking legend That's a rather charismatic duck... I'm not too big on racing games or sports games, 2 of my least favorite genres, though I am down to try anything new and have liked certain games of those genres. Should I try rocket league? Or watch some videos first maybe? When did BubberDuckey get added to Rocket League?  BONUS DUCKS! Bert and Ernie would be proud. Dude, you should play Duck Game.  Want to trade with me? I got a yellow ivy hat (PC).
 :] I have over 400 hours in Rocket League over the past year.  I still have NEVER seen the Rubber Ducky.  If you're on PC, I would be forever thankful if you'd be willing to trade one of those!!!

When that update released, it was the only item I had interest in.  I have now seen every single one, multiple times, except my ducky!!! To be honest I'm really glad it's fuckswithduck. If it wasn't I would be upset and message him to man up. XP. #therecanonlybeone That is a terribly charismatic duck. Rubber ducky, you're the one! Somewhere, sometime, buried deep within the comments, the nsfw link will arise Seriously how though? That is the one thing that makes me sad about the batmobile :( Oh it's you. \>Look at pictures

\>Lol, wouldn't it be funny if this was...

\>Checks username

\>OH MY GOD, IT IS HIM Just wanted to drop by and say you rock my duckman. I like seeing your duck enthusiasm! I expected that as you scrolled the the images, the camera would zoom closer and closer to the one on the antenna. Touch ball, doesn't matter how or why. Just touch ball. / summon the pidgeon master I don't know anything about Rocket League but this is hilarious.  http://i.imgur.com/5Jjj6Ts.gifv ^^^^^^But ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^did ^^^^^^this I kind of already knew without checking. I was like, this seems like something /u/fuckswithducks would... wait... \*checks username\* Ah... http://i.imgur.com/MMgfBox.png I thought /u/fuckswithducks was a "her." 🤔 CARL KING OF DUCKS /thread I did the very same thing! knew it was him without even looking at a username. The Internet is a truly strange place.  I was prepared to be disappointed if it hadn't been. i'd be disappointed if his car wasn't duck themed Life's just a big search for ducks in new places Surprisingly, not his collection. I would've been disappointed had it not been him. Oh fuck. We've been bam-fucking-boozled. I thought it was a her? /r/rocketleague yesterday had someone post over 100 pigeon head toppers they had won and today we got over 100 ducks topper. Coincidence? I think not.... So what file do I edit for this hack?

https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/546058/greetings_rrocketleague_i_have_amassed_over_100/ NOW THE DUCKS

ARE OVER THERE! I was looking for this comment. Reddit never disappoints... *quacking intensifies* that was honestly the main comment I was searching for haha 1000 ft *fog rolling in* Was waiting to find this.  Good, because it fucking is! [When you're that duck and you haven't told anyone in 5 seconds](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GFSjtxyKOuA/hqdefault.jpg) In Bubber Ducky you play as Bubber Ducky "Nah Jason, I don't watch your videos."

"What? You don't watch *my* videos?"

"Yeah, he told me earlier that he doesn't watch them. It's okay though, Jason is a very understanding individual."

"YOU SON OF A BITCH!! I HATE YOU!!"

"Oh shit, Jason, I'm sorry...!"

"You weren't around for Bubberducky, bruh, you don't even know."

"***YOU DIDN'T WATCH BUBBERDUCKY?!?!***" I'll have THE SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS! Ctrl+F

Glad I could find this so early in the comments. Man that voice is unmistakable  [I prefer the sequel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1TZB2edISs) I came here to link r/videogamedunkey haha [quote from the video] I thought I saw every dunkey video, and then this... Don't forget the epic remix [Bubberducky 2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH4D-yoKFg) ^^^^^^But ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^did ^^^^^^this It's not though, it's u/MinecraftK131 Technically it wasn't him Might be a stupid question, but who is this guy? Shouts to 207 Batduck looks like someone told him a joke he found a little too funny... Oh wtf, midcoast hype here on reddit I think the supes one would look better if the yellow part of his face/neck was matte instead of glossy.   No. Purely anecdotal: I have not changed my car design since they implemented inventory.  I get seemingly random items.  When they patched in inventory I got a bunch of duplicates based on the amount of time I had used an item. I didn't document the ratio, but was able to work out how long I used each item and how many inventory copies I got per said usage. 

I would guess he accumulated this time before the inventory update. /u/MinecraftK131 should know how he got all those duckies. I would assume trading on steam, a user posted to /r/rocketleague with a giant collection of pigeon toppers and that's how he did it.  Issue is the swastika.  Or more easily 
http://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/547407/greetings_rrocketleague_i_have_amassed_over_100/ Don't sweat it, it only got the upvotes because of the user name.  If you posted it, probably would have gotten buried.

Massive comment karma your way, maybe? If you're not using the Bubbles rocket boost you're wasting everyone's time. If it makes you feel better, only /u/fuckswithducks could have gotten those upvotes. Sadly i doubt you would get this kind of upvotes. Its just worth more when /u/fuckswithducks is the poster 90% sure it only reached /r/all because of it being /u/fuckswithducks It's just internet points.  [deleted] > it's all good
>, actually no it's not all good because people are seeing this post 

lmao, get over it People mentioned  /u/fuckswithducks so much in your post that you just started replying with the number of times he's been mentioned.  Bruh what are those graphics settings Lol you're mad cause it hit the front page?  So what you're saying is that you didn't care that he took your pic and shared it when it didn't have that many upvotes? But now that it has over 5000 you're upset?

You do realize that karma is worthless right? Who fucking cares how many upvotes jt got? This is pathetic  You can just see the regret building up with every edit. We're dealing with imaginary internet points here, don't sweat it.  Never underestimate /u/fuckswithducks. Yeah well it's only half as funny if you post it and your name is not /u/fuckswithducks The fact that you started to care only after this post reached a certain amount of upvotes is really fucking sad. It's imaginary internet point, you can't cash them  out. That's a fucking weird response, you really need the validation that you collected a few ducks? It's funnier with him How do you get the rubber ducky?

I never realized you could have multiple of the same. It's been awhile since I played though. It probably also gets so much attention and love because fuckswithducks posted it. Who Monty? http://imgur.com/a9HRGXU Damn, beat me to it! #I'll have THE SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS! Ducking hate auto correct. Pretty damn hard. The game give out rewards at random every couple of matches. There probably around 100 or so potential rewards. That being said, rubber duckie is the lowest tier You can trade with other people, or turn in five items of one level and get something of a higher level (uncommon-> rare, for example) I tried! I think my comments are being removed by the spam filter.  Can you please link it? Am I darkness? I'm sure fuckswithducks already x-posted I'm reasonably sure it's not a joke how the fuck is this hilarious if you dont know anything about it? lmfao hahahaha You jealous of my shower curtain?

 Took me a while to figure out what I was looking for, but thanks! He does fuck with ducks tho.  Uhh. Are we gonna have a problem now? My pitchfork hand is tingling but I like the duck guy...  
  
Edit: Never mind. /u/MinecraftK131 says it's all good. Now I'm all conflicted n shit. Is there any love for captain-euphoria, Season 3 Pigeon Collector Champion? Now what do I do with my pitchfork? No no no, he doesn't actually fuck ducks.  He just fucks, with rubber ducks in near proximity from what I heard. [Yep.](http://imgur.com/a/SUEXR) considering the genres of porn they have paid to have made its safe to say straight/bi male. I mean, the guy has an instagram, so it's pretty safe to say some people know:

Yes sir ...except it's actually him and /u/fuckswithducks just crossposted this from /r/rocketleague.  I love it when people spread my little comic around the internet. Cheers! Ayuh ayuh! How you doin bub?  You should also be wearing the Pirate Topper, man you're screwing this all up! Allegedly.  Thanks so you trade with other people for them? I know right You have to be in a party with them. From there you click on their name and youll see "invite to trade" That's some mildly terrifying animation Wow. That's a canadian commercial. On a single channel in specific markets. 

Damn, you hardcore, babe.  I was expecting a photo of that exact curtain with a time stamp Occasionally nostalgia'd in /r/worldofwarships.  Was this that game where you're a ww2 ship that gets sent forward in time and has access to all these new futuristic weapons? I played a game like that forever ago that looked just like this. The only thing I can remember gameplay wise was there was a boss ship with rockets on the back and a drill on the front who would absolutely wreck you over and over. Never beat the game.  I'm 100% sure it was ps2.  God I wish they would make a new one. Naval ops commander was my favorite game, once upon a time Warship Gunner 2. Ancient PS2 game, 100% relevance to modern times. Well, I think we know what America needs to research now in order to secure its naval superiority against the Chinese. 0-200* On the topic of 'philia your username immediately brought [this](https://static1.e621.net/data/32/4b/324b654d7387573f5f33c570bf207a65.png) to mind.

I'm not sure what you (reddit) expect but it should be obvious in hindsight. its also the name of a usb penetration tool Well, I mean, I hadn't really expected this post to reach frontpage with 5000 upvotes... Yop. http://i.imgur.com/UoULUtf.png I like reddit the way I like your tag. Meta Idk guys. I have seen a duck pic of his. I think it's safe to say it's a he.

LOL Reminds me of the time Dunkey beat Sky in Smash No I made this. P...pitchforks?  Fuckin rekt  You made this? And I love when people use the website I created to spread your comic! You made this?

I made this. yes, I made a post about it in a subreddit dedicated to trading and it got a lot of attention so I got like 100 duckies in 1 week http://i.imgur.com/FGou3E6.gifv I've been there a few times since I play WoWs. Never seen a mention but there would be that connection. It was the last good warship game of its kind until now.  
  
Edit: Glad you send me back. A new torpeadobeats episode was out. And it was a long one! Yep, that's the game you're thinking of. That was the last boss, she was a bitch to beat. Whirblewind, the first boss, is my favorite. [And the soundtrack for that battle was legendary.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldZg77Up86U) it's like reverse Final Countdown.  USS Nimitz gets sent back to WW2... Japanese Zero pilots see F14s and are like OMGWTF Naval Ops Commander probably. I have intense nostalgia for these 2 games Yeah that's the one. I played the shit out of it while my still worked. It was ridiculously fun. Thankyou PS2 is ancient :( Carriers that can move at 200 mph?  Yea, definitely. It's a reference to Shere Khan, from the Jungle Book.  My family cat was named Shere Khan, plus alliteration is nice.  I should have known furries would ruin even Kipling.  Sigh. You should have known better, honestly.  

u/fuckswithducks is a legend. You're owed 15% of karma royalties IMO... I love how all the tags are yellow.  Because what other color would you use.   What a big duck. me too [deleted] I made this.. No, I did I see.  But before trading you could just get multiples?   This looks like it inspired the scene in Don't Hug Me I'm Scared. Where is this from? Love the song, but that video was *weird as fuck.* What in the entirety of fuck  Is that lazy town? ಠ_ಠ  No gif is complete without a rubber duck in there I wonder if I can find "The Ronnie and Nancy Show"? 

Somebody had to upload it to the internet. Preferably in grainy vhs with nostalgic 80's commercials. Are you jealous of [my usb stick?](https://sramage.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ducky1_1024x1024.jpg) May I see a picture of your collection sir? I've been trying to figure it out for years. For a while I thought I made it up I own the game, I own a PS2, I emulate, 1080P! My dad was in the Navy on a carrier. He said those fuckers can move a lot faster than their published "top speed". For you 4 u No, me too You made this? Yup Land of Confusion - Genesis

https://youtu.be/QHmH1xQ2Pf4 Green is not a creative color!  Scrub scrub scrub 'til the water's brown The music video for Land Of Confusion, I believe. The Genesis version. Disturbed's cover has a neat video too. Land of confusion - Genesis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlBIa8z_Mts Its from the Land of Confusion music video Check out Disturbed's version. Cool video, not creepy Feels good don't it? Have a nice weekend with that load off your subconscious.  Was he a sea man? Was memeing this thread part of your plan? thanks I made this I've been a huge Genesis fan since I was little. When I was 10, I decided to sing Land of Confusion in a kareoke contest. Well, I had never seen the video before and the kareoke machine was one where the words were being shown on top of the video. I was so distracted by how odd the video was, I just stopped singing after about 1 verse and just stood on stage watching the craziness. The moral of this story is, Genesis has some weird ass music videos 😆 That was terrible to watch high, 1/7 There's a serious Primus vibe goin' on there... Such a good song. An impressive amount of work went into that music video. Disturbed did a pretty awesome cover of it, too.  I don't know if I can listen to that song again without these new visuals in my head :( Amazing song. Oh lord. Was that supposed to be his sweat? I don't why that was the most disturbing part of the video to me. I was a little kid when this video was released. I'm not going to lie, this video scared the living shit out of me. My mom worked early morning shifts, and i would be dropped off at my Aunt's house around 6. I'd usually head up to my teenage cousin's bedroom and wake them up. They shared a room, and most of the time they would fall asleep with MTV on. Back then music videos would play all night. I can remember times this video would come on, and I was literally diving under one of my cousin's beds. Still gives me the Willy's when I see it. That's one heck of a nurse I always thought that was a disturbed song! The only time I've even listened to Genesis was when I played random CDs my dad had. I had no idea Genesis made that song. It sounds great, though.  Is that the one with Disturbed's "mascot" inciting a revolution?  Weren't we all at one point? Of course! NP M80 [removed] I've been on a serious Peter Gabriel kick this last month and yea, he has some good n' fucked up solo videos himself.  Just watched that video this morning oddly enough.  It's some weird shit.  I'm not sure what kind of drugs everyone was taking in the 80s but damn, looks like a crazy time. Don't hate me, but I like the Disturbed cover of Land of Confusion better than the original.  They actually got the dolls from an existing British news satire show called Spitting Image. These NEW visuals ? That was the official music video of the song ! [The Last Domino - Part 2](https://youtu.be/hPYaEplq7KQ?t=268) is on the same album, way more "disturbed", pretty funny to quote Collins from it, since people don't tend to have awareness of the song, and out of context, it sounds like it'd be something from a death metal track. The other day I zoned into Markarth and I got that glitch where things spawn in the sky and fall to their death. It was a guard. Another guard walks up to his lifeless body and says something like "I'm gonna find out who did this." In Morrowind the guards killed all attacking beasts There is real life history that precedes this, wacky stuff. For example, Xeres, the emporer of Persia, ordered a bridge to be built across the Hellespont which is a narrow straight of water separating Europe from Asia Minor.

 Soon after the bridge was built a large storm hit and broke apart the bridge. In his anger, Xerxes ordered the Hellespont flogged. Those that whipped the waters shouted out that it wronged Xerses with out cause and he will cross whether or not it wanted him to. (paraphrased as I do not want to bore you with the full quote)

 Of course the engineers of the bridge got the worst of it as they lost their heads. 

Still flogging a straight because a storm destroyed your bridge...that would fit right in with Skyrim. Every time a guard kills me in Skyrim, he stands over my body and says "Wait, I know you."  If Skyrim was a TV show, guards would be the omnipresent comic relief. Reminds me of something that happened just last week in Skyrim.

I was at Lakeview Manor, just came home to give my daughter a new elven dagger, when suddenly a single bandit appeared. My steward came out of the house, and helped me vanquish him. I used no spells, no magic, or shouts, just my sword.

Immediately after the bandit died, my steward turned around, set my cow on fire, and walked back inside.

Bitch the new cow is coming out of YOUR paycheck! Reminds me of that time I walked into Ivarstead and somehow [a pair of chickens got on the Empire's Most Wanted list](https://youtu.be/Yqep6e-euAs?t=20s) [I caught](http://imgur.com/HL9bvZM) this Imperial officer trying to kill the Jarl's daughter... not sure how that happened.  Slaughterfish are such a pointless thing to have kept in elder scrolls after removing underwater combat. At no point in the game do they ever pose a threat, just distract your followers from responding to actual concerns and preventing you from fast travelling because a damn fish in a pond you can't even see wants you dead  I remember I once pissed off an Ivarstead Guard during the first Dark Brotherhood mission where you kill that one insane dude.  I killed the target, and booked it over the waterfall and swam several miles down the river away from town.  Over half an hour later, as I was climbing a mountain, *in a different Hold,* I saw that same Ivarstead guard sprinting along the road below me, scouring the landscape looking for me.  It was in that moment that I knew;

**The Ivarstead Guard** ***has*** **no jurisdiction.** Say, whatever happened with that Oblivion/Skyrim mod to expand the map to include every other Elder Scrolls game's geography? jesus christ browsing this sub on thanksgiving morning sure brings out a FUCK TON of old memes and ancient reposts for some reason No Lolligurgling.
 Whatever version of Skyrim I have on my xbox (never updated because it's not on the internet) has a glitch that slaughterfish will walk on-land about 20 feet away from a body of water and start biting your feet I forgot I had the deadly Civil War mod enabled, so upon my return to Falkreath all I see is about 20 dead Imperials and almost twice as many dead Stormcloaks. The guards spent about a half hour walking around asking "what happened here?" But the Swan still remains at large I once used ice form on a cow, and a guard started running up with his weapon out. Expecting he was going to attack me I drew my weapons... he ran past me and slaughtered the remainder of the cow before putting his sword back... never went back to that crazy town. [His Grandma would be proud](http://i.imgur.com/4EkbmS9.jpg) Skyrim's AI is the most immersive out of any video game I've ever played. 

>npc is sweeping the ground in front of home  Guards don't fuck around. I usually troll them by using my thu'um in villages and telling them to fuck off more where that came from but one time I accidentally blasted a chicken and it was game on I once caused a small civil war in GTA San Andreas when I dodged a policeman who was trying to hit me, causing him to his comrade instead.

All the surrounding policemen immediately picked a side - either the comrade or the attacker - and started beating the shit out of the opposing group. you laugh, but these are the same guards who trained chickens to inform on criminals *guard* "You have commited crimes against skyrim and her people,  what say you, fish?" *Fish refuses to pay fines , calls him a faggy skeever and bites him* *guard* BY THE NINE I WILL SLAY YOU! *proceeds to drown fighting a fish on his own turf* I still love the Whiterun Guard saying "If those Whiterun Guards can kill a dragon, so can I" That dude just exposed one of the most elusive and powerful shape shifters in the realm and we're all mocking him :-) Seriously the greatest game ever made Bethesda games are so fucking dynamic basicly everything can happen. I love it! [Oblivion Gaurds?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_x-x0gawck) This is some dwarf fortress shit, I love it I love casting dire charm on Flaming Fist soldiers as they try to arrest me. Then watch them beat each other to death, while both proclaim  ***I* AM THE LAW** its an old repost but it checks out. I was playing Oblivion once and antagonized a guard. It was early in the game so I was way under-level and knew I was toast, but I figured I'd take a crack at him anyway. Between him continually staggering me and me Mayweathering around him, I lost him in my line of sight and panicked. I looked around and didn't see him. We were right next to the river, so I figure he fell in and drowned. Skyrim belongs to the nords There will always be ghosts in the machine. [Oblivion guards not much better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYAkrJil_w0) Do you know humanoid enemies in Skyrim cannot drown? In Oblivion they can drown. This is clear racial profiling. That Slaughterfish didn't choose to be  that way! It a crime to be yourself?   My best Skyrim guard moment was when I headed north out of Dawnstar following the coast round to Morthal.



Just out where the river joins the sea I spied a group of guards escorting a prisoner. The lead guard confidently led the column off the path, onto the ice, very close to the edge. 



And then he fell in. The other guards and the prisoner all stood there as this hapless guard drifted slowly out to sea. This is like something you'd see in a Monty Python movie. What is this? I've never heard guards say you dare dishonor the legion? Fish deserve a fair trial too Which begs the question, what does Skyrim fish court and fish jail look like? Hey man, the law is the law.  To be honest I'm amazed it's doing anything. Those guys were really slow about helping if you came running at them with a Sabre Cat or a bandit on your tail. Did you download a mod for guard dialogue or something? I've never heard them say "you dishonor the legion?"  You can't spell "slaughterfish" without "laughterfish". Upon completion of the prison mission near Markarth(?), me and all the other Forsworn there escaped into the city.  Me being a dumbass, I decided to piss off as many guards as I could and steal as much as possible.  Eventually I booked it out of the city, and as I spawned outside the gates, about 40 guards flooded out after me all screaming for my arrest.  Wish I sill had the footage. NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME HERE I haven't played most of the game, but that's fucking funny. Reminds me of a kid in catholic school who got bit by an ant, looked at it and yelled "I'm telling!". Yeah, I hated that kid. One time I attacked a kid in a village in this game and the guard started chasing him lol it was so funny.  fish lives matter Looks like Oblivion I like these dedicated guards. Hahaha hahaha Sooo.... no touchy the fish? Watch the Skies traveler! /u/GrimBear21 Rebel scum! Only in Skyrim. Not on my watch :) So is Skyrim remastered at all worth it on PC if you already own Skyrim?  This is what skyrim was intended for.  Well, HOW DARE HE DISHONOR THE LEGION! This is truly.....magical fyi The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition is on sale right now  He's just being cautious. It might just be a duck.  Let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll. ... and then you crashed to desktop, losing 15 minutes of open world travel.  I think the fish does dare dishonor the Legion! I only found out about those fish when I fired an arrow into the water and got a kill-cam. Only time I've ever seen them. Probably because of their fugitive status. I was stealthing through a dungeon. I had just arrived and had definitely not attacked a single soul. A bunch of necromancers were infesting the place. They had been raising barbarian corpses. One necromancer walks over to the pile of pre-placed corpses and goes on alert. "What's this? I'll find out who did this!" Suddenly the whole dungeon was on high alert because the necromancer found a body in a pile of bodies that he presumably placed in the cave himself... What do they mean? Ahh reposts... Since when do fish attack guards "You dare dinosaur the Legion?" I miss playing Skyrim so much, I'm gonna get back it lol I was screwing around raiding whiterun as a werewolf and it froze as I was killing a guard and everyone stood there until my character grabbed him face and slammed it into the ground whole everyone watched and then everything started moving again, and I was like???? What??? Is Skyrim fun? I'm a hardcore cod fan. No grey area for them is there? /u/MannoSlimmins is a cuck Halt ! Do i know you ? I think ive seen you before ....  "It just works." - Todd Howard  *shakes fist at sky* You call them glitches, I call them that old Bethesda RPG charm.  That line is broken. After capturing Whiterun, a Stormcloak walked up to an Imperial body and and said "I'm going to find whoever did this." You did. You did this. Had that happened for like 20 minutes straight. I was in tears from laughing so hard. I had this guard stuck half-way into the ceiling in Markarth. I could see his legs hanging there. Found his upper side on the roof, tried to talk to him. Poor guy fell to his death and died at that shrine-thing. Guards are like this in a lot of games, I've come to find. My favourite is in Dishonored (and now Dishonored 2 as well). The game is very obviously meant to be played in Stealth, because taking advantage of all the things they allow you to do in combat makes for odd situations. For example, in Dishonored 2, I'll parry a guard and grab him to choke him out. While doing that, another guard will swing at me and kill the guard I'm holding in front of me like a hostage. As they do this, they bellow, "Nooo, you killed him you bastard!" It's like, no I didn't. You killed him. I was trying to put him to sleep non-lethally. 

It can also be annoying though, because if you are trying to be stealthy, sometimes what will happen is a guard will get into an altercation with a civilian and kill him. Later, another guard (or sometimes even the same guard!) will come back and find the body, putting him and the other guards nearby into search mode and the game counts it as you having one of your bodies found even though you had nothing to do with that entire exchange and might not have even been there to see it happen.  I once killed a guy right in front of a guard and he said "Everything's in order" After killing Ulfric in my last playthrough, his body was sitting in the corner of the room. Every time someone walks by the dead body, they'll say things like "Oh no, this can't be happening!", then continue with what they're doing I got attacked by a vampire cult in Riften and got the same voice line after coming back and the bodies were still there, like who else do you think killed the guy Reminds me of that hilarious moment in Morrowind when you find a random dead old man falling out of the sky outside of town and he's carrying a "scroll of icarain flight".  So THAT'S why half of everyone is dead whenever I go into markarth! Dude, that happened to me in whiterun, so I dragged the body somewhere cuz I didn't want that in my streets, and when I got to the bannered mare for a quest, EVERYONE attacked me! It was crazy af and I had to load a past save. I had the same thing happen, but the body fell right in front of me. The guards assumed my guilt and attacked me.  I have that glitch and it's driving me insane! It was hilarious at first when a full sized frost dragon comes wriggling down, bouncing all over the place. Now it's just annoying. Does anyone know the fix for this? *"Who did this??"*  
  
Gravity.   Sheogorath I haven't done the Dark Brotherhood quest-line despite having 10 dragon priest masks.

I go to Solitude to check out where that broken Windshear sword is, but of course the boat is not there. But I can see three silhouettes on the horizon - I start to swim out there and what do I find. Three khajiit just hanging out in the sky above the river. Two drop down, but one still defies gravity. I'd have thrown something at him, but we were quite a way from the shore. Sounds like a Matrix prequel.  Was the dead guard's name 'Tarhiel'? If a police officer fell out of the sky, I'm pretty sure the police would investigate it as a potential homicide. Especially if we lived in a world where powerful wizards were a fact of life. The remaster we deserve You N'wah! They do the same thing in Skyrim and Oblivion. Morrowind was the game where it only worked half the time. Haven't played morrowind would you recommended the morroblivion mod or just play morrowind   And I quick saved every 5 minutes just in case I fell through the floor  No way... I remember being chased by a cliff racer while my resources were depleted, ran to one of those forts near Balmora for help and all the guards just watched while I was slowly pecked to death.  I think there was a similar story about a roman emperor who ordered his soldiers to go to war with Neptune and mobilized them at the nearest beach. *cue roman soldiers furiously slashing swords at water* He had "fuck you" money Who among us can honestly claim to have never physically assaulted a body of water? He also allegedly branded it with hot iron spikes. I've been told that the hissing sound they heard they thought was the sound of pain from the punishment. Was it Xeres, Xerxes, or Xerses? Every time you said his name you spelled it differently o.O Did you just spell Xerxes differently three times?  Yelling at inanimated objects? #shitmytoddlerdoes  Historians think it's likely that this was likely made up by Greeks since the writer of most that history was Greek and I can't remember his name for the life of me. It's also not the only reported one were a leader had his army "fight the sea". I think a Julia-Claudian emperor, either Caligula or Nero I think had their army do it in the English Channel because they hadn't had any military conquests. There's more to it but you get the idea and historians think it's possible that this was also propaganda by the emperors opposition. You spelled "Xerxes" three different ways.  Could you please choose one way to spell his name? lol, i imagine him being all like 

"shit! i killed the guy who kills all the dragons for us!" If you have a small bounty and talk to a guard he will say that line.

Stupidly enough you can just leave the conversation at that point without any consequence. Fucking hell I've had that happen so many times. Never gets old.  https://youtu.be/PipsYsb7HaI I fucking love this game. XD Skyrim with a laugh track, oh god. They're like the Keystone Cops of Tamriel.   *full house music plays* [It kind of already exists, and it is great.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxHbO1MHXuI&list=PL3F85878A2CA41ABE) "That guy pissed me off so much I need to set a bovine on fire!" Please. We all know that those soldiers just wanted some chicken for dinner.  What are those capes and how can I get one? These guards are really hesitating on that arrest, I think they are the chickens... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TphEh0Qgv0  lmao /r/iwanttoapologize  The life of an emperor's soldier...

Want some food? Threaten the food with trespassing.

Want some wine with that food? Tell the wine bottle to get out of here or it'll be arrested.

Want a nice warm bed at night? Tell the bed it best be gone or else.

In the end... "Alright, you asked for it!" The chickens were probably tagged as owned by the Stormcloaks, which made the Imperials perceive them as an enemy.

Or y'know, it's just Bethsoft being Bethsoft. Hilarity aside it looks like one of your mods added the chickens (possibly other animals too) to a faction and that's what triggered this  funny behaviour. Usually creating a bashed patch with Wrye Bash or a merged patch with TES5edit will sort this out (unless a poorly made mod is causing the screw up). A shame that he wasn't trying to kill the Jarl's son. He's an annoying little guy. I just started playing last night and accidentally shot a horse. I had no idea the level of fury I had incurred.

Then I made a wrong turn and approached a giant thinking it was a bro.

So far, Skyrim hates me. Cast one of the elemental cloak spells. I don't know why but this really made me laugh.

"FUCK YOU HUMAN!" Hey, you can never have enough Companions shouting "DIE, DAMN YOU!" at the water! I like bowfishing them. 

Also, I'm fairly positive if you shoot salmon you get salmon row as well as the meat, which makes like 24 hour water breathing potions that level alchemy like a fuck. Well, you know the saying... "Feed a man a fish and he lives for a day, but feed a fish a man and he lives for a lifetime."  Once fish knew they could live forever off of one man, the war between fish and men started.

Dragonborn swims across a river.  
Fish: "You are trespassing here, be gone!"  
Dragonborn keeps swimming.  
Fish: "Alright, you asked for it!"   "Wait, where is the enemy?"

*Looks at the pond* 

....."A fucking fish." You use followers? Are you into suffering or something? You don't see that level of commitment to your job these days. Someone was looking for a promotion. That's a lot for a mod maker to do, especially if you know of the lore for the game. Something like Elswyrr has only two major cities and hamlet's in-between, with Khajit ranging from giant sabre-cat beasts to something more akin to housecats, but they are all still sentient Khajit. 


Or the Bosmer of Valenwood don't typically have murders in regards to crime since they do something called the "green pact" where they only eat meat. They also can't waste meat, which makes them partake in cannibalism. Bandit attacks you? Be ready to eat them.


So I think the scope of a mod like that is just too big for 3-5 people to do for free. You should check out Elder Scrolls Online. It is mindblowing compared to Skyrim. I haven't heard about the ones you're referring to, but Skyblivion and Skywind are two mods currently in development that I've been following pretty fanatically. A small group of players are attempting to recreate Morrowind and Oblivion using Skyrim's models and game engine. They have a website, Twitch, and YouTube channel (including occasional 8 hour streams) that are worth looking into. No school, kids (and parents) are bored at home waiting for dinner [deleted] They always show reruns on Thanksgiving. I saw this comment this morning and thought you were just exaggerating. But now this post is surrounded by 3 other skyrim memes, so sorry I doubted you I originally read that as if Jesus was actually reading through reddit. Lolz. He probably was Hey, Pal. I see you're walking down the valley of Old washed up, retired memes.   
Here, [take this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbaTur4A1OU). It will aid you on your travels and farewell.  Well it is Throwback Thursday I just came here because someone took my sweetroll :( Ah yes the Darwin mod Im playing special edition on ps4, started getting attacked by something on land, turn around to see nothing, look down and Mr. Slaughterfish is "swimming" a foot above the ground.  Very talkative investigative reporters. No luck catching them swans then? The greater good ((Honk)) Stop right there, criminal scum!  ...what is the context of this woman berating a dejected pelican  That's not irregular. It's not usually done, but sweeping the ground gets rid of the loose dirt, leaves, and water. It's probably more common to sweep the roads, but it's still not surprising to sweep dirt. It just isn't common in modern times. Next TES game will have a guy in his mom's basement fapping to a statue of Dibella. "Back off man, I was just trying to make it stop raining." I need a video of this... 😂 And yet after averting the biggest disaster of the age no one bats an eyelid or even acknowledges the dragonborn's deeds  Oblivion was great for random shit like this. 

You could befriend people to make them aid you in battle, you could piss people to the point they will try to kill you. This made a lot of crazy shit happen.

Also some NPCs would steal and get a  bounty so the guards would just slaughter them.

Sometimes there would be some friendly fire when they tried to stop a criminal which would end in all out war.

The radiant AI system was new and quite buggy, it led to tons of hilarious moments.
 It just works. Skyrim Legendary Edition is [on sale for like $8](https://www.dealzon.com/deals/elder-scrolls-skyrim#elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-legendary-edition) during Black Friday sale... too bad you don't get the auto upgrade to Special Edition anymore (that's like $25 ~ $28 right now, not really worth it). If the carp had the stats of a troll. Baldurs gate? Flaming fist soldiers were charm proof without a shit load of dispels prior.  
No idea how you could be bothered.   
Baldurs gate.. The game that deserves another sequel but im too afraid of how it would turn out to expect one. **AH SERRRVE THA FLAMING FIST!** I sense something that I have not felt since...this one time on Reddit not too long ago. > me Mayweathering around him

lmao *touches apple for one yoctosecond*
Stop right there, criminal scum. On second thought, let's not go to whiterun. It is a silly place. I'm pretty sure it's only areas under Imperial control, Solitude at the beginning and any holds you take over later if you join the Imperials, I don't think it works in holds already friendly to the imperials at the beginning since their guards aren't replaced. I once had giant Chase me, guards tried to help... Slaughter... But... Touch the fish. Nearly died lol I prefer modded original, but once mods are made for the new version, it'll probably be a bit better. It was a slaughterfish, it attacks everything, and i guess the guard got in the water and got attacked. Old man yells at cloud "Watch the skies, traveler." MENDOZAAAAAAAA! >*Damn you, gravity!* "They did this. They are assholes." ROFL XD "Wernstrom!" at a glance i thought you said shakes *fish* at sky.. xD I read "Shakes fish at sky"
I'm disapointed DAMN YOU TODD  Some may call them glitches, but I? I call them treasures. Yeah, I hope things like these never change in Bethesda games. At some point in time games will be glitch free and we will look back on the glory days of Bethesda glitching. It really is an art form I love Bethesda. I'd sell my sister in a second for one of their games.  It's a Bethesdism. I'm gonna find whoever did this... and give him a hi-five! I killed a random redguard that spawned around that "my time of need" quest and their only reaction was "I'm going to find whoever did this". I did it! I'm not even sneaking! I can't believe you've done this "His fellow guards always knew Helmut wasn't playing with a full deck, but when the blackouts started, they knew their comrade needed help..." I feel like there's a life lesson in that somehow. Seems to be logical to me. Another police coverup.

First scenario, you did it!

Second scenario, you did it!

The AI is advanced... Is that not basically the whole plot though?! Getting framed for murders In Penguin0's Dishonored 2 video a guard threw back another guards head that he threw at him.  That being said, there are some absurd AI upgrades in Dishonored 2. I'm playing on the normal difficulty, and guards will notice if other guards are missing from their post and start looking for them. It's a small thing, but honestly a really immersive touch. That's "Felony Murder" for you, criminal scum! They could just store something like what entity was responsible for the kill or what team id was responsible in the corpse. I had the same thing, I ended up moving the body so it sat on the throne still. That always annoyed me. If you're not going to bury him at least hang him nude from a lamp pole or something to show your power. Fucking noobs. That's because killing Ulfric is probably the worst thing you could ever do. 

 Lol whenever vampires/cultists attacked me in Whiterun, I decided to hide all the dead bodies under the bridge [like under the entrance]. I literally have like 7 bodies there already [one belongs to a dead guard]. Also had Nazeem there but I think he got moved to the Hall of the Dead.

I had to Fus Ro Dah some of the bodies as they were stuck. He's alive until he hits the ground If you're fast enough you can actually watch him fall. Did you stop the psycho in the Market ? Dude, I have four Dragon Priest masks and haven't fought the Whiterin dragon. Hell, I'm married and have two kids in Proudspire Manor, plus completed the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves' Guild and Dawnguard quests before doing the first dragon.

Open source, cross-platform engine to replay Morrowind on, ready for [some delicious shader work](https://forum.openmw.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=2905) and compatible with a lot of already existing Morrowind mods out there. And unsurprisingly unlike Skywind, you'll actually be playing Morrowind. I'd rather see Daggerfall remastered. Die fetcher! Oh yeah, in Skyrim the entire town tries to kill the Dragon. Definitely try one or the other. I myself havent tried morroblivion but one could assume it has less bugs than morrowind. But if you want the true experience play the original. HAIL CALIGULA

THE BEST ROMAN EMPEROR Yup! Then he ordered his troops to collect sea shells as trophies for his victory. Hard to seperate fact and fiction with Caligula, but I've been told that he also returned from that war with spoils, having instructed his men to load chests with shells and starfish.  Also appointed his horse to the senate I believe. From what I've heard, the arguments for that range from Caligula legimitately being insane and thinking that was a rational course of action, to him ordering his soldiers to do that because (IIRC) the general of that army wronged him in some way and that was his punishment. 

Romans did have a tendency to be insane though, seeing as they preferred sweetening their wine with lead... Judge Fish.  He had "fuck everybody" money. I see you've just come from that thread as well.  Pretty sure I went down a straight drop water slide at a water park and did not cross my legs which lead to me being physically assaulted by a body of water! *Let he without sin skip the first stone.* "Fuck you wave!" *Punches wave* I've stabbed a snowbank or two in anger with a shovel. Yes, once. Did their blacksmiths think they were torturing a bucket of water every time they quenched something? Yes.

But for real, it's Xerxes. There's actually a mod for the PC version (not sure if ported yet) that ensures the guards respect you appropriately based on your accomplishments, including exclamations sort of like that. Best immersion enhancer I've ever installed.

[Guard Dialogue Overhaul](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/23390) But he stole a sweet roll so sentence him to death It's because your fame has made him turn a blind eye Small bounty being the key words. He suspects you, but it's not a big enough deal for him to bother unless you literally walk up and confess "Have you been to the cloud district?"

*Dragonborn proceeds to kill Nazeem.*

*HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!* "No lolligaggin'"

Hahahaha hahahaha  Dragonborn puts a basket on a guys head.  
Hahahaha!  
Dragonborn steals all the cheesewheels.  
Ohhhhhhhhhh!  
Dragonborn is encumbered.  
Awhhhh! You can even see one of them looting the chicken :D But if i want some chicken every person on the planet instantly wants to kill me. Thats it! Don't say I didn't warn you!

Apparently that is a murderable offense. > approached a giant

Every new player joins the Skyrim Space Program at some point. It's traditional. I think you mean *croak* spells, sir. Whenever a Slaughterfish randomly appears in a nearby pond, my follower would just unexpectedly disappear until I found him/her hitting that Slaughterfish that stupidly _swam close to the shore_ for him/her to kill it.  Wait, what? Dude, I've been playing this game for five years, how did I never know that? I'm somewhat scared to go back in that save file, because I think that guard might still be looking for me.  I'll complete the main quest, save the world, get married and adopt kids, and then one day The Ivarstead Guard will be standing at the end of my bed when I wake up.  It's like the movie It Follows, but in Skyrim. to riften guard! partake?  To be fair, there's a lot more than 3 to 5 people working on it, and it's still somewhat active. It still may never amount to much, though. > with Khajit ranging from giant sabre-cat beasts 

For a second I thought you meant they range around the country on giant sabre-cats, fuck that'd be so cool like giant sabre cat battles and shit. > with Khajit ranging from giant sabre-cat beasts to something more akin to housecats, but they are all still sentient Khajit. 

I'm okay with this. So when can we play that game? >  too big for 3-5 people to do for free.

Bethesda please. We'll give you all the monies. I'll even throw in 10 shmeckles. Sabre cats and house cats are still sentient. Oh god, imagine doing High Rock. You'd be debating politically angry Bretons the entire time. I bet spez only plays as Bosmer.  Key word in the comment being geography, not actually making it all. And as far as I know what you are describing was attempted with morrowind but never completed [Nice!](http://i.imgur.com/35bDxLp.gifv) It's just the one swan actually You violated my mother. I remember killing someone and then right as I do it, the camera would zoom behind me right into the guards face. Scared the shit outta me. 

"STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!"

OH FUCK.  She was walking by, it bit her, she scolded it. Yep, and it's super satisfying too! That feeling of the broom softly brushing the ground, leaving the smooth clean surface in its wake. Sweeping the dirt paths to to the house was one of the few chores I actually liked when I was little. Mate I wish I could oblige! I think there are a few photos on my old PS2 memory card that I took with the in game camera, but no video footage! "Hey you saved us from Alduin. ... So you uh, you get up to the clou pffft ha what am I saying of course you don't." Do they even know about being in danger in the first place though? i dont know which elder scrolls game it was(or even if it was those games) but i remember reading about how there was a point in the game where you had to go talk to a prisoner but every time the play testers tried to see him he was dead. Turns out the guards were getting hungry and stealing the prisoners food which resulted in him dying. That's pretty fucking cool but hilarious at the same time. I didn't even know I got the reheated edition. I got Legendary Edition for $8 last year, and wanted to play it again and then installed the reheated edition accidentally. It was a pleasant surprise except my computer can't run it very well due to it being older than sin. **EVVY *CRAAAAM* MUSS' BE PUNISH** Curse you mysterious white fluffy clouds! What do your shapes mean!? Tell me!!  Why is this so familiar? [Old lady yells at frog](https://i.redd.it/r29sy119kblx.jpg) It's raining men! 💦🌬☔😋🔫 Greybeard_irl "What is it? Dragons?" At least they went to the Cloud District Oh my god. This brings a whole new meaning to the saying. 

It will never be the same again.  But me* Some call them Kosm. Send pic. *claps* No, fuck you. Find me whoever stole my sweetroll, asshole. Well, I'd never thought of it that way. For the first scenario it makes sense. But for the second, it's a technical aspect of the game that exists outside the gameplay and just doesn't make sense. Like if the guards don't know you're there, why would they use one of their own murders to make an excuse to search for you?  It's one thing to frame you for murder in the public eye.

These guards rolled nat20 on bluff and actually believed you were the murderer even while cleaning the victim's blood off their own swords.  Well, I feel dumb now. Kudos to solving the mystery I couldn't.  Kingdom of Bernies.  I stripped him and bent him over a table... Found the Stormcloak That was my favorite body stash as well.  For sure! Paralyzed his ass. Is this something currently in development? It's stuff like this that makes me believe that communism is possible. I didn't like Morrowind when I first tried it, but that was on a garbage computer so the whole thing looked like arse.

Only after playing Skyrim on a swish new 'puter and realising I love hiking but not impressed with the samey dungeons - I wonder if I'd have liked Morrowind if the hiking part hadn't been so bloody ugly. and then everyone dies, i really liked the idea of dragons attacking towns but i wish they couldnt kill named npcs [He's a god now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJvVEt6F_Xw) Movie is 10/10 That actually sounds like a really fun day at the beach
 I don't know why but I find that kind of adorable. And the tale of Glitterhoof begins... His horse also had the second biggest palace around at the time, and dozens of slaves. From what I've read, Caligula want that bad. The stories we have about his lunacy were rumours spread by his political enemies. And even then, they were known to be satire in their day but later scholars didn't realize that. There were definitely some crazy ones but even Commodus, the crazy emperor from gladiator, is believed by many historians to have been a pretty sane person.  The crazy stories of his reign don't appear until after he was assassinated and the senate needed to justify killing the emperor.   Caligula's histories were also written by his political rivals, so it's also possible that it was something much more minor (maybe even just a comment about it or something) rather than actually having his armies attack the sea.  Alternatively, he was batshit because Romans did indeed love their lead. I didn't. What was it? Did you sue?  *sexually  Yeah probably at first *Psst. I know who you are. Hail Sithis!* There's also a mod where instead of dying you get raped and robbed :D Me: "I am a vampire lore arch-mage master conjurer and destroyer, dragonborn that killed Alduin"

NPC: "Go fetch me x amount of y and don't come back until you do you weakling"

Skyrim in a nutshell. It pisses me off how little respect they have. I could rip their whole army to shreds within seconds. I hope there's a mod like this that also applies to NPCs and when I haven't done shit the dunmers should call me an N'wah.  Thanks for posting this, I need this. Unfortunately, I am the High King of Skyrim. Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying? Of course you don't. An aesthetic mod that gives me something I actually want, makes clothing look cooler, and remains lore friendly?

I don't believe it. Glad you mentioned that before I went all Fable on that chicken I keep seeing. I could be wrong, but I think salmon roe came with Hearthfire.

You also get it from catching the ones that jump up those little waterfalls by Whiterun Bone app the teeth Parfait Auto correct. Thank you for catching that. bone apple teeth IIRC some of the larger quadrupeds are used as mounts Elder scrolls VI: Elswyrr. Takes place 300ish 4e. You are a political prisoner of the Dominion. Calling it Please, thats wayyy too little. More like 25 shmeckles.  That is actually a lot of money, at least $2000 I think he means, they still have intelligence like the Khajiit everyone thinks of normally.

They just aren't humanoid in phsyical form The word I used after Sentient was "Khajit" to point out that they still act like a normal Khajit, they're just shaped as a small housecat OP meant "sapient" Every city talks shit on the empire cuz their city was it's own kingdom at one point during that period that there were literally over 100 kingdoms in the tiny-ass province. If you held a therapeutic beach-sweeping class I would consider attending. You should consider becoming a Janitor. You could do this all day long. I still don't know what the Cloud District is. Please, he's dead by that point Well wasn't faendal's mum screaming about seeing Alduin?

Edit: fixed phone post errors ... You could be onto something here. The dragonborn could be so efficient at killing dragons that they never really pose a credible threat.  Same preface but I remember hearing a story about how a guard would leave their post to go arrest and turn in a criminal which would prompt another guard to go and arrest the first guard for leaving their post, and you can see where this is going... It was Oblivion  Sounds like oblivion Reheated edition? Is that like when you put old coffee in the microwave? I think if you buy before a certain date you'll get auto updated as long as you have all expansion/DLC aka Legendary Edition. You can't handle the truth! The shapes, Nazeem. What do they mean?     [Relevant](http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF069-Not_Today_Little_One.jpg) Are you sure he didnt just say Lokvahkoor? Turn into a squuuaaaare, cloud. Turn into a sqweeaaar. Cloooooud turn into a square shaped cloooud.  Doesn't look like anything to me.  With the chrome extension "cloud to butt", I was very confused. [The Simpsons](http://i.imgur.com/91sn32Q.jpg) Simpsons reference. "My cousin's out fighting dragons and what do I get? Guard duty." It's like... It's literally RIGHT THERE. I can see it from here! I could throw an apple and hit someone in the cloud district from where I'm standing!

It's just up those steps in front of me! It's not like it's Narnia! It's not in some magical kingdom filled with dragons and elves!

I mean, it is, but so is the rest of Whiterun! Don't mind if I do  But me? Me call them treasures. Me Tarzan. edit: 
wrong You have a rep around town. :p Makes you an easy target. Hahah you're welcome #EMBRACE THE WORD OF MIGHTY TALOS Skyrim belongs to the Nords! I dumped all my bounties and letters of inheritance in there. First time through I saw what was happening and Fus-Ro-Dah'ed him in a panic... I pissed off everyone there and they decided to fight me. It's probably going to be in development forever. Morroblivion is finished though. yes, every month they release a update video and after several months they release a huge update video. however even they say its a long way off Or at least wish they would let the actual soldiers handle it instead of going in with an iron dagger It would be... if said emperor wasn't Caligula, who screwed his sisters, let his wild beasts maul and eat innocents, and planned to appoint his horse as Consul, among other things... 
My horse has always struck me as being of a dependable sort, a quality I feel is sorely lacking in my councillors. Time to shake things up a bit.  Yea, that's sounding familiar. Makes you wonder what people in the distant future will think of what we write about our politicians, lol.

I can't tell if I should be disgusted or intrigued.  There's also a mod that makes guards say ridiculous things like ~~"I once was an adventurer like you until I took an arrow to the knee."~~ "I used to be an adventurer like you* but then* I took an arrow to the knee*."  Hilarious!

Edit: forgot to include the star symbols. And thus, further justifying the sneaky archer character type. If you're always unseen, it makes sense that nobody knows who you are. "I'll have you know there's no pusssyyyyyy^y^^y^^^y^^^^y " Haha yeah, I like small aesthetic mods like that. Gives the NPCs' clothing some variety as well, and I believe it works well with Frostfall. Chicken Chaser? He chases chickens! I'll test it out later and find out! Thanks! Thanks but I can't eat this. I'm lack toast and tolerant.  Blonde amputee Bone apple tea. Would that be before of after Skyrim? I can't say I remember the years each of the games take place in.  They already trademarked elswyrr IIRC. Very likely prediction. Sapient is the word. Alright, I gotcha. I believe they can even speak the same language as the other species, and the 'normal' humanoid Khajit have to act as interpreters for the human and elves that visit. Well, the lore size of High Rock is actually about the size of Europe. And we all know what happened in Europe regarding "too many Kingdoms." I do not understand that sentence. Not having played Skyrim might help have helped, but that sentence... It's when you put an old Skyrim in the microwave. The date has passed You can't handle my potions! [You can't handle the truth!](http://p.fod4.com/p/media/undefined/I8IaBViFSM6OR017deYU_You%20Cant%20Handle%20the%20Truth.gif) You need us up in that sky! Forget it Marge - it's Chinatown! OH MY GOD , It's a triple rainbow! Yes they deserved to die and I hope they burn in hell! The Cloud District. Nazeem, LIGHT! The Grandpa Simpson lego minifigure is holding a copy of that newspaper, it's easily one of the best accessories ever We have that posted in our office and added a title saying "<ManagerName> rants about infrastructure outsourcing"

Because <ManagerName> is close to retirement (old) and is rightfully weary of attempts to outsource applications and infrastructure (moving them into 'the cloud') without thinking of the hidden cost and security implications.

The poster is up next to the "Office Training document", which is the picture of an F1 key, the bumper-sticker saying "The beatings will continue until morale improves", [Dilbert from 2008-08-31](http://dilbert.com/strip/2000-08-31), and [XKCD 806](http://xkcd.com/806/) Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll? So do you go to the cloud district very often? Oh, what am I saying. Of course you don't Don't mind if me do The character the guy is referencing says "but me? I call them treasures" Cookie Monster would Round up the usual suspects. My first playthrough I didn't even see it happen, walked straight to the apothecary shop, came back and someone's asking me if I saw the attack and there were two dead bodies on the ground I was confused af. I saw him kill her the first time, then reloaded and ran him through with the ebony blade (enough times to fully charge it). Did it turn out? And funny enough, *no one* plays it. Nah it's been blessed by Bethesda and is constantly improving they are always looking for extra help as well. Plus their previous project morrowblivion was released and it didn't have nearly as much support as skywind does. Perhaps like taking the "Thanks Obama!" memes seriously and assuming we worshipped presidents as minor deities and praised them for all things.  Yay! I used to be an adventurer like you* 

FTFY But then* I took an arrow to the knee* tall or rent* 100 years after Of course they trademaked it, it's their intellectual property and they don't want someone else to take it. That means nothing. Yeah actually, there is a mention in the lore that the house cat Khajit made good spies because no one suspects a housecat of eaves dropping  The Holy Cyrodillic Empire took over?  My strongest potions are fit for a beast let alone a man! Poshieens The fact that this starts with Jack Nicholson bugs me... DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED? From the top of the ocean

#YEAHHA!

From the bottom of the sky STAY OFF THE WEST SIDE! I hate that place, theres no puseeeeeeeyyyyyyy. Fifth Element? Man, that's an obscure reference.  Omg those comics are great No Lollygagging Fair enough, I wasn't aware. Someone should 'splain good grammar to that guy. This honestly was an issue for me in Skyrim and Fallout.

In New Vegas I've literally never seen the altercation between the girl and the guy who collects caps.

But he always runs up and assures me she was nice and then went crazy on him.

...Then I kill him for his star caps.  It's pretty good. A little rough around the edges but easy to set up, beautiful to see and play, and overall quite fun.

I mean it's the old game made to look new but a couple differences in how dialog and the menu work make it slightly fizzy. Haha! Yes yes yes! Daddy yes! Haha!! They have to actually use it for something, or they will lose the trademark. You just can't go around trademarking words you are not even using in trade. Your potions won't save you when you *need more mana!* /r/potionseller is leaking YOU'RE A RASCAL. With no respect for knights!  he eats breakfast 300 yards from 4,000 storm cloaks who are trained to kill him Your god damn right I did! Well I get claustrophobic

I can you know that I can! I know your kind, always sneaking about. Sometimes the girl survives and chats with you. If you hurry, they fight just outside of Nipton. Hey, for a team of people who gave up there time for years to make it happen with no help from anyone that actually made the original game, i'd say it's pretty good.  As someone who's played Skyrim and Oblivion for a long time, I tried out Morrowind and didn't really like it :/ 
Is this recreation better?  They use it all the time in every game. It's an explorable area in ESO. It's an entire continent on Tamriel, what the fuck are you talking about them not using it? My potions bring all the boys to the yard!  But I have mana potions.  Let's all have another orange Julius  You mix potions? Can you brew me an ale? It certainly deserves a slow clap that wells into an uproar. A major technical accomplishment and fun as hell. Morrowind starts slow and awful with the stupid combat system. If you're okay with the combat getting better over time (or using console commands to make it reasonable), dialog being tiny text, and limited fast travel, it has the best story by eons. I say that as a TES fanatic.

However, if you are turned off by the trappings of games from that era, your only hope of loving the game is mods. And it's okay if you just don't like it. The graphic overhaul just makes it like an oblivion DLC with more story. Which product they have marketed with that name? You need to have a brand or product explicitly sold or marketed with the name for a trademark. Using it inside creative content does not make it valid for a trademark, and they will lose it and have to reapply to regain it if they are not bringing out a product and/or brand.  My potions are in the top percentage of potions. No you don't, you used them all fighting the last boss. So you fancy yourself an alchemist? That's a pretty good resume fluff if I've seen one. Hagrid Simulator Wow, looks great. I love the contrast of the slow pace of the day versus night. In the day you can fish, cut trees, hunt etc. while at night you have to defend yourself.  Sort of a survival/action game, for Windows, Mac, Linux.  Not sure of the release date (next year sometime I think?).

[Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJptLWXRm2Y)  It recently got through [Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=792383821).

Edit:  

If anyone's interested in similar quality upcoming indie games check out [Screenshot Daily](http://screenshotdaily.com/).  Sorry for the self promotion, but there are no ads/monetization.  I curate indie games and make gifs from trailers/video so you can judge stuff quickly.  There's a full RSS/Tumblr/Twitter.  Feedback appreciated it's a bit of a passion project. Andre: the apprentice days. Before the dark sign swept the land What a horrible night to have a curse Dang!  He was punching the CRAP out of that one thing. This looks a LOT like Kingdom. 

Except you're a loner badass instead of helpless recruiter. Does he have Wooden Nickel tho? The style reminds me of a slightly less dour [Sword and Sworcery](http://store.steampowered.com/app/204060/). Looks fun :) They put Dan Harmon in a videogame?! I was expecting the gif to end with this.

https://imgur.com/EucIfYY Came here expecting the Binding of Isaac, but this works too. The Hound is back! Reminds me of shovel knight.  That's a good thing.
 wow kinda reminds me of hyperlight drifers pixel art style.  For the love of god please come to consoles, this looks super fun.  This one's a Keeper. Perrin Aybara One of the enemies looks inspired by "attack on Titan"? This looks fantastic, reminds me of Kingdom. Will definitely pick it up when it releases.


It's weird, there's so many great pixel art games coming out recently. 2D Pixels for life y'all. 3D is overrated. Is this the 2-D brawler/platformer that can fill the void in my heart that Terraria left behind? I WANT IT
AND I WANT IT NOW This looks fun.  I will look for it when it hits the store. Is this a real game?  Awesome looking game! can it be on Vita? I was thinking to myself "what a peaceful game", and then I saw the flash of lightning and thought to myself "were those bodies hanging from the trees?". Then dude rolls and smashes other guy's head in with an axe! This would be great with about 4 times the pixels. I'm on a Pixel game fix (HLD, Kingdom 1 and 2), so I will definitely been looking forward to this.  Is this for console,PC, or mobile? Same developer as Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery? Looks a lot like Rogue Legacy. Graphic wise. Man I'm gonna get this sucker when it comes out!  That looks as fun as Gunpoint! Alright, what direction should I throw my money this time?  But, where is Drowzee? Ok so i need this game now I'll never get tired of 2D sidescrollers, they've remained my favorite genre ever since I was a kid and there's no genre that gives me a higher feeling of immersion (not even first-person games, surprisingly).

This one looks great, the art style has that warm, familiar, soothing look to it that a lot of the best 2D sidescrollers tend to go for. I NEED IT. Hi brother. This reminds me a bit of superbrothers: sword and sworcery.  Dan Harmon: The Game is out!?! Am I the only one who thought "risk of rain?" Exact same art style and that roll is spot on if there's someone in this thread who wants to make games for a living. I would buy any game that looks just like this. Pixel art is amazing and we DONT have enough games that do them properly Sandor? I thought this was Kingdom: New Lands for a second. Great game btw. Reminds me of Logen Ninefingers A quick google of "the keeper" returned a menstrual cup instead of this game.  Vi-ta! Vi-ta! Vi-ta! The Hound Simulator This reminds if a little game called "witchmarsh" Those animations are so SMOOTH! This game is what my soul goes through on Mondays.  Looks like Shovel Knight meets Broforce. This reminds me of that old samurai Jack flash game that was free to play on cartoon networks website. Another pixel indie game huh. I kinda get a "under the sea/garden" vibe from it.  Looks good :) 
 Ok this looks sweet Looks awesome, I hope it's not another "survival rouge-like indie trash with souls difficulty" game
I absolutely despise indie games that try too be hardcore, I just want to play casual platformers, beat em ups and such. A Pixel indie side-scroller?! Wow never seen anything like it. Damn that looks badass as heck. I like the survival aspect of it as well. /r/noisygifs In the days of easy and free access to Unity and Unreal engines I really don't get the need for every indie game to be pixel art anymore. Gameplay looks great though. That hand movement when he's working on his bench looks so good, Jesus. That alone got me interested. How do I play this game? and...he's doing typical dumb video game shit...what else you got? Wow, this looks beautiful.  I really hope that events like when the swordsman pulls you out of the tower are spread throughout the game, it looks really cool. Seems like a fun game. Sweet trailer. I just get the feeling it's kind of a spoiler as too what you'll encounter story and enemy wise.

Please tell me there's much more to it?:) Dan Harmon simulator?  This game would be great for ios/android! Welp, my interest is officially piqued. Yes, please. Tom Bombadil - the game. Damn, those bodies hanging from the tree gave me chills.

This looks amazing. The new God of War looks great Looks good  Lumberjack vs Zombies I love 8 bit games.  
Just sayin. Just beautiful. Love it. Your gif made me want to play a game. After watching a video trailer I am not so sure anymore. You did a great job. Keep it up. "But pixelated graphics are just a excuse to make a game ugly for cheap, blah blah blah" RemindMe! 72 hours Huh, super cool looking. Definitely gonna keep an eye out for this. This looks fucking awesome, I'm 100% sure I'm going to get my ass handed to me uncountable times, but I look forward to it What do you plan to price It? I want to save up. The trailer music and scenery was absolutely beautiful, by the way. Whoever made the music should be pat on the back. This game looks AWESOME  remind me of castlevania, i like this style  I think The Keeper has some inner demons to face . This reminds me of Bunyan, the lone woodsman featured in the Breath of Fire series, master fighter, wise world-worn all around badass. Remindme! 1 year This isn't gonna be on console, huh? :( But can you play that with an ultrabook and one of those cpu-integrated intel HD graphics cards?

I'm seriously asking. Because Diablo 3 is best played on my laptop at a maximum of 15fps (that's the lowest setting. I wish I could go lower). Do want! This looks awesome. Looka pretty good. I would play it. The one thing I like and think Terraria should add is the way the buildings work. Imagine in Terraria that when you exit a building it becomes background to you could walk past it instead of through it. And then when you go into the building it comes up the the foreground again.  all i can see is a medieval trucker's delight. Reminds me of The Hound circa Season 6 GOT. Is that wreck It Ralph? Judging by the art style it's the same authors as the Kingdom: New Lands. Looks good, I'll check it out. I had no idea Hagrid was so violent. This looks awesome, looking forward to it in the future  Is it coming on iOS?  My only criticism is that it isn't an overhead view like Zelda. I feel the horizontal scrolling format isn't gonna keep me interested but ya never know, it looks awesome otherwise  Great soundtrack, it encapsulates a lot of different emotions depending on scenery in a very smooth way!  Those opening scenes are beautiful, I have a macbook pro, is there anyway to have something like those opening screens as a wallpaper, like an actually moving wallpaper? did you use game maker to make this game?

looks beautifull btw, congrats! Been following this one for awhile. Looks great. Is this already out?  Ninja Gai Fieri Wish this was coming to iOS. I have been scouring for a good mobile game. I cant find this on the steam store? Did he just punch that dude in the face? Looks like the new god of war to me. Wow. Great sprite work! Is this released yet? If not, when? Weeeeell, I'm extremely sold. This is exactly my type of game. Could a game like this have been made on old consoles of the day? what prevents something like this from being made at that time? Looks awesome. Is this a one man operation? If so.. Wow. Finally a game where i can play as Ron Swanson. Reminds me a bit of Superbrothers:S&S. The graphic style looks almost identical to Crawl. Magnus Burnside? That is virtually unwatchable in full-screen looks sweet, hope it gets an IOS port eventually Probably my favorite move is the fact that you can punch a baddy straight up in the face. Those hanging corpses that are, but aren't in the tree... Spooky man. This oozes atmosphere. I'll be watching this! This reminds me of samurai jack but with more gore When can I play this I can't find a release date / month / quarter for this. Does greenlit mean weeks, months, unknown? Any further release info? Release date? Bunyan... is that you? Bombadillo simulator! Looks fun, I hope it has enough gameplay features to not get boring This graphic and fight style reminde me of [Not a Hero](http://store.steampowered.com/app/274270), hope it's as good. This one's a keeper. Reminds me of the Woodsman from Over the Garden Wall How can i design that graphs? Which program? Wow, just replace the main character and that' what I've always wanted from a Samurai Jack video game. Wow this game is right up my street. Can't wait. It looks kinda like Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery Love those combat animations.  It seems so difficult to make characters physically interact like that. Mmm i like it. I'll keep an eye on it Looks a bit like Superbrothers: Sword and Sorcery Made by the same people that made Kingdom I would assume. Great game to check out btw guys, looks exactly like this. Looks like Guacamelee
 Reminds me of the Scottish dude from Samurai Jack That was very peaceful until it wasn't  Hehe, that would be a pretty neat concept. *Andre* simulator more The Scotsman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEWv9RpE_vs Haven't laughed this hard in a while... i would buy it if you make it, it would be comfy as fuck as well. Like harvest moon but 2d  Combat reminds me of The Mark of the Kri *confused with hodor* Night does look really amped up, love the roll into the axe swing animation.  I wonder how long the two periods are as the day does look relaxing, unlike Kingdom or Don't Starve. So its [Kingdom: New Lands](http://store.steampowered.com/app/496300) but you do the fighting instead of building/training a town/army
 The only thing I have to say is that the parralax is freaking sexy in this game.  So you're pretty much the Hound in the Long Night 2? Looks cool. I like your website. The best game review in my opinion is a clip or two of what playing the game is like. This is a quick way to get a taste for a lot of games. It kin of looks like it has combos, similar to how Guacamelee does. Can anyone verify that or not? You should make it a subreddit too so I don't have to leave my cozy reddit ecosystem. When it turns night a text box  should come out slowly typing out "WHAT A HORRIBLE NIGHT TO HAVE A CURSE." and then dope ass music starts playing I'm not familiar w/ greenlighting process.

Is this game just entering development, or nearly finished? Is there a release date?

there is not page for this on the steam store so I can't add it to wishlist. I guess following it is the closest thing. Looks like the exact art style from Kindgom: New Lands, sounds like similar gameplay too, I'm down! Dude, freaking lovely website. No apologies needed, fantastic content.  I like your site,  Please keep it up! :)
The loop gameplay GIF(?) is large and I like it, more interesting than static screenshot, but less overhead to watch than video. Made for lazy bum like me! Can you recommend your favorite Indie games that you've covered since you started your Daily?  Maybe top 5 or 6? Love your site, thanks for sharing Your site is brilliant. An excellent resource for indie goodness. I really expected him to just kill the butterfly and go "None shall pass", given the title. >so you can judge stuff quickly

You know your audience well I just wanted to say I love your website. I can't believe how many cool games are on there! I am following you on twitter since a few months ago. Found some games that I liked because of you, thanks! i like it Just wanted to say i love your site. The focus on the visual artistic aspect of the games is great, and the minimalistic approach on information and details is just enough to spark my interest for a lot of these games. Two thumbs up! At 2:00 The enemy throws a knife, and he grabs the knife MIDAIR and then stabs the enemy right in the eye. Seems like its going to be a great game with level of detail.
 I know some people may complain, but why not monetize part of it with banner ads? Not intrusive, a lot of people use ad block anyway so if they're upset enough then they'll block it on their own. If it's your own work and project, there's no shame in advertising for it. That's basically the only way to grow anyway at the beginning Whoa whoa whoa, was that a Titan in the trailer? So the poor guy never gets to sleep. The animations while he is fishing, and when the enemy jumps in the air, look reminiscent to Shovel Knight PSVita Version pretty please? Seems great. Not a fan of the music, though. Thanks for the info and your website is really nice. Especially well optimized for mobile. Great job!  hopefully this will fill the stardew valley shaped hole in me It's really nice to see some pixel art that doesn't have really low fps animations! Thanks for the info, and I also took a look at your site and I would like to read more. One thing, though: Don't make all gifs appear on your frontpage and load them all simultaneously. This kills performance and sucks data from mobile users.

Good job though, keep it going! Could use someone sifting through  all those indie games and dig up the worthy looking ones and summarize what they're about. Is there a subreddit for games like this? 1:50 Shingeki no Kyoujin?

2:07 Neon Genesis Evangelion?

How many references did I miss? Who paid you to post this? 1:50 Wtf that Attack on titan reference haha Thank you for this, it's always nice with new or more indie games.  

This one looks both pretty and badass.   So, 2D Minecraft without the building but with vastly superior art? Can't a poor Viking dude get any sleep around here? The screen shaking is giving me a headache. :( Otherwise looks awesome. (: Looks cool thanks RemindMe! Sometime in 2017 I think. Keep it up! Remindme! 6months > Greenlight

Your blog is great. I've already made note of a couple of games I'd like to have in the future. Nice concept.  Amazing art style But when does he sleep? That game's death and fighting animations reminds me of Dustforce. RemindMe! 9pm Simon's quest? This looks super cool dude. How can i follow this project so i dont forget when its released? I really like quality pixel art and this looks like an interesting game. (im kinda new to steam) Aw, it looked good, but "survival" killed it for me.  Release it for iOS? Looks like it was made by the people who did bro-force. It looks fantastic. So when does he sleep? Is the artist from r/gamedevclassifieds? I feel like i recognise this character and art style :) !Remindme 2 hours damnnnnnn Prithee, be careful.  That was definitely my first thought too.  *double bass kick* No no no, it says The Keeper, not Eve "Castlevania 1 didn't have that shit, it just had goofy skeletons throwing bones..." I missed The Black Dahlia Murder in Baltimore a few weeks ago. My buddy went and said they play so much of "Nocturnal." So sad I didn't go :/ Tell me you've seen their live DVD? It's fucking amazing.  >dang

no swears pls thx It reminded me of Roger from American Dad. I think that part of the gif is the DEFINITION of that. Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to watch the language  "You botherin' me at night, when I don't got any fishin' to do? That's a good way to GET PUNCHED"  
-What I imagine he said- Yes seems like he can do everything, cook, clean, slay evil spirits.  What a catch! Which I like way better  There's the /r/bindingofisaac leak I was looking for.  If he can take more than two hits or is eligible for any health upgrades whatsoever then what's even the point of playing? I hope so. He's pretty worthless without it. had to control+f to find this.  the pixel animation style and lightning made me think of it instantly.  i wonder if you'll have to fight a grizzled boor. We found an old game to go back to and it was awesome

*dramatic music and pan out to white* I love that game. God I loved sword and sworcery, one of the best games I have played imhop. I thought the same, is it made by the same people? the final boss is a mannequin leg. I thought this was the Community 8 bit game at first. OOoooo, that's perfect. \#NotMyKeeper I was scrolling the comments to find someone else who saw the similarity haha.  Does it?  Feels different to me, both look pretty good though (but I prefer HLD's). Nice one, Dad! Also the blood moon with the creepy guy in the lake reminds me of "Berserk" I'm not seeing it. It looks like a pretty standard Samurai-themed enemy with the cloak and hat, the lightning flash, and the heavy blade.

Edit: Ok, I see that he's referring to the trailer now. I only saw the GIF, since videos are blocked on my network. How is kingdom?  What's good about it? I don't think so.  It might tickle it maybe?  But I don't think it has the same depth at all. Yup! Like owlboy? Risk of Rain and Terraria should be on your radar. Windows, Mac, Linux for now.  I'm not sure if anything else is in the works. Oh man!  I'm so sorry, meant to reply to you earlier but you got lost in the deluge.

[Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.](http://i.imgur.com/MpzuCeq.gifv) Now that you mention it... yeah.  That looks very cool also! You get to fish on Mondays?!  Lucky! Whatever happened to that? I bought into the early access of under the ocean and it seems abandoned. Unless I'm thinking of the wrong game.... You can't blame them. Every designer dreamed of trashing the player and forcing them to master the game. Every designer wants his game to succeed as a test of dedication.

Before Demon Souls the consensus was easier = more money and designers have to eat. But after that game's wide appeal now they feel they can achieve their dream. Make a game 100,000 might play and quit, but 10,000 will enjoy eating shit until they master it.

It's the same concept as esports really. In that group too you get trashed until you learn. Everything has been done before.  What game gets you excited? 
>badass as heck

Stealing this. Pixel art is beautiful and simple which makes it easier to make unique art for your game. Just grabbing some 3D assets and stylizing them a bit doesn't look as good IMO. We also don't need every game feeling like a Unity game though. Of course, one in ten developers can make it not feel like another engine rehash, but the concept remains.

It is good to have variety, be it Unity, Pixel, Unreal, or some other in house. It's easier to make. 

People can say it's artistic choice or whatever, but at the end of the day pixel art requires less talent so way more people are going to use it. Keyboard and mouse I think?  Not sure if there's controller support. Not my game, but I hope so! Not sure about Mac, for PC there's a program you can use for moving backgrounds.  Can't remember the name at the moment though. None that I know of :( This looks like something you can do on Unity. Hagrid's daily life, in nice graphics, you play out the Harry Potter series over the years from Hagrid's perspective, day by day, year by year, with the ability to skip forward to the interesting events of the HP plot all the way until the end.

Edit to elaborate, since I keep thinking about the idea: Like a weird version Skyrim or Fallout where it's open world with optional quests, except instead of you having to choose between the plot and side quests, you explore the wizard world however you want and the plot just inevitably comes to you here and there. Tons of weird side stories going on all the time whether you're watching them or not, conversations had in pubs that you'll never know about unless you're there at the right time. Game takes control of Hagrid just in time to walk him back to where he needs to be to meet the important plot interactions of HP, and you get to watch him and the other characters experience those memorable scenes at all his significant moments during the books, before regaining control to explore. 

Sounds like an awesome concept... too bad it would require some sort of AI to generate the side story content somehow. Way too many man hours involved in manually writing content to fill all of the open world areas with interesting things for almost a decade. Just the fact that there aren't set events triggered to initiate storylines, but rather hundreds of interesting things are going on around the world at any given time and you'll never have time to explore all of them in your lifetime, it'd be pretty neat. AI could make this kind of experience possible. http://m.memegen.com/xqyxtw.jpg *Do come back alive...* I've never played a game that requires such constant vigilance like don't starve. I can't eat or drink and am usually holding my breath. My first thought exactly.  And it's a good thing. Oh wow didn't that start as a flash game on newgrounds? Cool to see the creator was able to make it a full game. It's an interesting concept but I feel like it could've been more complex while maintaining its simplicity.  
Also bothered by - spoilers ahead - the poor ending.  
I hope they won't be afraid to be more intricate with this one. How is that game? Sounds like a fun concept! The concept goes as far back as Castlevania for the NES.  Thought K:NL looked really cool, went to steam to check it out.  

Of course it's already in my library, and as usual I'm not sure how it got there (probably bundles). sounds awesome If you like parallax check out [Samurai Blitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yto0Fd6iaU#t=6s). Hi, I"m dumb. What's parallax in this context? Preorder and get the fawukin' chicken expansion > So you're pretty much the Hound in the Long Night 2? 

Nah, pretty much Don't Starve Thanks!  It's definitely meant to be quick.  I guess since I've been influenced a lot by reddit I like to be shown something before I have to read. From the game's [steam page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=792383821):

>"...a combat system focused on combos, executions, defense and counterattacks." God, that games combo system was so satisfying and rewarding without needing to be super deep. I need a sequel or another Metroidvania game that feels like it.

Such a great game.. Feels like I'm already spread too thin!  Not enough butter spread on too much bread something something ~Bilbo

You can go through my submission history if you want the highlights though. =) *This twisted wretched place shadowed by the utmost darks of hell* I'm not sure whether it's early or late in dev.  I think more to the early side.  No release date yet (as far as I know).  You'll have to follow it, usually once the Steam store page opens you'll get a update/notification.

Greenlight is just a voting process on Steam where approved games are allowed to be released on the platform.  You can submit whatever to Greenlight, so it could be an early concept or a finished game. It means the game has enough done to be able to show off at least a trailer of gameplay.  The purpose of it is to help the developer with a guaranteed method of publishing.  Think of how much it would suck to finish working on a game, but have it be rejected from Steam or other distribution platforms.  Once your project is Greenlit, you can breathe a small sigh of relief that your game will have a home on a store shelf when it is ready.  

Contrast this to frantically, pennilessly (because you just spent the past 2 years developing this thing full time) Trying to get someone to put your finished game on their shelf so that you can pay your rent next month.  The earlier in the process THAT part gets done, the better. Greenlight is a stage in game development where an idea or a prototype for a game is cast into the public, and they vote for it. 

Popular ideas may at some point be "lit", which means that when finished they can be sold on Steam. 

It's basically a way for Steam to filter the good stuff out from the indies.

As for this game.. if it only just greenlighted, it won't be released any time soon. in some case it's just a concept or a very early build of a game but in other cases, the game is finished but the developer can't convince Steam to put it in their store. These devs may even alter their game multiple times to fit the requirements that Steam asks of them and still fail to get accepted by Valve. So The greenlight process is way for these types of developers to get into steam via popular vote ( there has to be a larger "yes" vote than a "no" vote) even though they haven't been recognized by Valve previously.

Which means if the game becomes completed as per the developer's goals, then the Steam will put it up on their Store.  Some of these games become part of the Early Access program and some don't. That's why you can see games within the Greenlight system that hasn't popped up in Early Access or haven't popped up in the store yet. The devs are taking their time to build it properly knowing they got a seat in Steam waiting for them. 

here's a better explanation:

There really is a lot of cool stuff on the horizon, indie games are getting better and better.  Great time to be a gamer I think. I'm a lazy bum too, so I made it for me as well. =) [Gris

Sorry I can't provide more links (working overtime atm)!  Any questions feel free.

 This is an awesome question, I'm flooded at the moment.  Give me some time to answer. :) Thanks!  That means a lot. :) Thanks!  And I can't cover them all.  Imagine five years from now, we'll be flooded with goodies. O.O Super neat to meet a follower in the wild.  Hai!  =) Yay :) I hate banner ads myself, plus feels like it would spoil the aesthetic of the site.  Also, the traffic isn't enough for the money to be worth it anyway.  I think I'd prefer to do something like donations/patreon, probably not as much money but keeps it separated and less intrusive.  That's way in the future though. :)

>If it's your own work and project, there's no shame in advertising for it.

I guess, but I don't want to be seen as a shill for my own stuff.  I'm really here to show off a cool game, and I'm kind sneaking in my site. >.<

Thanks for the reply! Thanks that's good to know, don't often hear from mobile users.  The gifs shouldn't load on mobile, unless you're using Mozilla which unfortunately I can't fix at the moment.   :(

Thanks for the feedback! Mmm, /r/indiegaming?

Not sure if that's exactly what you're looking for. haha good time! Neato, glad to hear! There's a follow button on Steam if you're logged in, beneath the trailer.  Also on the right is the link to their Twitter/Facebook so you can follow there. Glad I'm not the only one who immediately thought of The Black Dahlia Murder. Thank you. I think you might be the only that knows I'm referring to Castlevania II, haha. 

Fun game if you played it with a Nintendo Power and always had a pen and paper to write things down nearby.

I don't think AVGN had such luxuries  That's a bummer. I still hold Nocturnal as the best metal album released in the past 10 years.  Haha, I'm aware of them but haven't listened to them. 

I actually remember this line from owning Castlevania II, and the night and day mechanic  Flip the POlice r/madlads o heck https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/nov/20/full-of-hot-air-row-in-canadian-parliament-over-the-word-fart-video Yeah he was losin' it.  
I *punch* HAVE HAD *punch* ENOUGH *punch* of YOU!  >Yes seems like he can do everything, cook, clean, slay evil spirits. What a ~~catch~~ Keeper!


FTFY Is he single ;) That's exactly what I did, lol. God that was a great episode To be fair it's a bit apples and oranges. This one seems a bit more grounded in reality as far as its pallets go, where as HLD was basically adventure time levels of colorful.  It's got that same immersive pixel art feeling. The gameplay is definitely different just the artstyle when I look at the trees and character models.  He's talking about the trailer posted in the top comment, I think, because there's a big humanoid with no skin that looks a lot like a titan in that video. Well it looks legit, regardless. Good work Name? cool Risk of Rain, got it on my list, thanks man. Me and my brothers have been making good play of Terraria for years though. I've personally bought it for three different platforms (mobile, PS4 and Vita)  Oh ok thanks! Tbh I get his point. I like pixel art indie games but it kinda gets old. It's hard (at least for me) to get exited over those trailers if no special innovative gameplay feature is shown.



While this game looks really nice, the gameplay shown is average to me. 
Don't get me wrong,  this probably is a really fun game, it's just that the trailer doesn't do much for me (I'll keep an eye on it though). Pixel art is beautiful but the blocky, minimal approach seen here and dozens of other games gets old fast. For once I'd love to see a game [REALLY explore](http://i.imgur.com/2IBbvYv.gif) what can be done with pixel graphics. I am sorry. I mean. How do I download and play this game. I can't seem to pay for it. rainmeter > Like a weird version Skyrim or Fallout

    
A) (Yes) Yer a wizard, Harry!

B) (No) Yer not a wizard, Harry!

C) (Sarcasm) Sure, Yer a wizard, Harry!

D) (Leave) What happens if you stray from the plot? You need to be watching WestWorld, sir! You're watching Westworld, right? I can't upvote this enough. Such a great concept! > hundreds of interesting things are going on around the world at any given time and you'll never have time to explore all of them in your lifetime

honestly even as a huge HP fan, take HP completely out of this and make it any genre of RPG and it would be sick lol  Literally cleaning up monster shit for hours a day. Sounds a bit like the game of Life.  Basically, "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" for gaming. It was definitely stressful.  Much prefer to play those types of games co-op.  The laughter helps with the impending doom. Dying (or the looming threat of dying) in don't starve is half the experience of don't starve. The game becomes boring once you've become unkillable. Agreed, opens up some new gameplay while having a similar feel. It did! It's a great casual game to pass the time, and New Lands is a great addition to the game. I played the original Kingdom a lot, haven't played New Lands too much but it looks like it improves on the formula. 

Very chill and relaxing, with atmospheric music and a nice art style (with some randomness to keep it all from getting stale too quickly). 

The mechanics are simple and it's not that deep, but it's still charming and unique. Definitely worth checking out! >Soon on Android.

They're breaking my heart keeping this game only on IOS. If you like parallax, don't check out Jim power on SNES

https://youtu.be/_WGIQpVUDEQ    It reminds me of my favorite game as a kid, [Shinobi 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prZAjV0pGAc). Cool thanks!

I've actually been on an iOS buying kick. There were a bunch of promos and sales for Black Friday and cyber Monday, like Final Fantasy Tactics for 3$ (from 14.99), FF7 for 3.99 (from 15.99 iirc), also picked up Lunar: Silver Story complete, i guess it's remastered or something because it looks different than my psx version, Infinity Blade 3 for .99 cents, and final fantasy MOBIUS and EXVIUS got free (that might be normal price idk).

I forgot that iOS has a lot of super legit ports of really really good JRPGs. It made me wonder what else iOS has to offer, as I usually just watch Netflix or Reddit on the go.  > parallax 

http://i.imgur.com/Q56dN2l.png or sonic And checkout mayhem in monsterland on the c64.

I love that game, promote it every chance i get Holy shit when the guy died I was really surprised!  *Wait, what, why does the hero di...* oh my god that was fantastic! Eat the noms and revive! Fuck yeah :-D Watch the background.  The further away stuff is supposed to be, the slower it travels across the screen.  It tricks the brain into thinking there is distance. I am lost too. But I guess it's the layers of background moving at different speeds as you go through the level. Kind of a point of view thing, where layers are use to show a kind of depth in a 2D game. That's my interpretation at least. Agree with /u/epicgeek above, I am frequently frustrated seeing a game 'movie' vs actual experience and most often reconsider my purchase after watching a Let's Play from some rando streamer that has 50 views and doesn't make the game seem interesting. Instagram and Snapchat are the future my friend, like it or not. Great idea to have short clips playing in people's feeds. Much more likely to check out then a 6 min IGN review. Not a bash on them just the direction we're moving in. 
 Thank you, kind sir.  That game had some of the most satisfying combat I've ever played. I wish i could go back in time and play it over again with fresh eyes. The art and music was incredible too.  Haha okay fair enough.  Thanks for you efforts, I like what you're doing making it easy for lazy people like me to see short trailers of new games Is geenlighting is completely separate system to early-access? Plenty of fully complete games go to greenlight to be added to steam. Being lit doesn't really have any bearing on a game's progress at all. Greenlight can be all over the place. It's the easiest way to get your game up on steam regardless of its current state. Some games can be almost finished, others can be prototypes they intend to totally rebuild after greenlighting. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥This game is👌💯"lit"💯👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Indeed. I'll try and make sure to check it every now and then =). And I'm with you on the banner ads! Gris; looks like Journey 2d.

Yono; elephant zelda?

Totem Teller; no clue.

Highfleet; a weird Luftrausers.

that looks amazing It's been awhile but these suggestions were excellent! Traffic may not have been enough, but by hitting the front page of reddit you're going to be getting a *lot* more of it. I hope many site owners think the same way you do :) I like your website's idea!
Good luck! Ok, didn't try it on mobile, good on you to think about that. But also on PC, I got a YT video running on 1080p on my other window and noticed your site lagging a little while loading all those gifs. Maybe that's just my special case, though. Done. Ty! Ahh good old goofy BDM

Gorrila honing trigger finger! Forget them! Golly you're bad ....yours is better. How about he says mine right before the fight and yours while he's doing the punching? Aaawww, I always miss out on the catchy phrases.  Well done. :P [Meet local guys in Low Earth Orbit tonight!](https://xkcd.com/713/) Maybe the badass huntsman fights giants by skinning them alive? Not my work, I just post cool stuff (imo!). :) I get your point also, and thanks for fleshing it out.  I guess I was just tired of the dismissive generalisations.  His comment could be about most games tbh.  Except maybe an RTS, we need more of those. ;) I figured, I was just being mean, sowwy :)  It's not out yet, the link on Steam just means it's approved for release on Valve's platform.  I don't think there's a release date yet.  Next year maybe, but probably not any time soon. Ye must be a wizard!

Yer a wizard, Harry! (Persuade)

Yer a wizard! Will this make you believe me? (435 Gold)

Listen to me, damnit! Yer a wizard! (Intimidation)

Maybe yer not a wizard, Harry. (Lie)

Nevermind, we'll talk later. Choice E: Use that umbrella like a daedric claymore and whip it around at young 11 year old harry.
Suddenly an echo goes around the room and you hear, with this character's death, the thread of prophecy is severed. Restore a saved game to restore the weave of fate, or persist in the doomed world you have created.


Oh shit this isn't Morrowind. Nvm, he'll just be unconcious while you are fucking up his Uncle and using Avada Kedavra on Dudley only to leave your Aunt for his sick and twisted ways. *screen goes red*
DESYNCHRONIZED This guy is taking Roy off the grid! This guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy!
 Everyone else's skin starts turning grey, eyes bloodshot, they start asking questions. "why are you doing that Hagrid? You're meant to be going that way Hagrid. You shouldn't go that Hagrid." until you stray way off the path and eventually they wear their cloaks up all the time so you never see their faces, apart from glowing red eyes (not the main characters though, just red eyes and black skin for them, got to have that character recognition). Then the comments get more darker. "No Hagrid. Do NOT go that way, Hagrid. I can't let you do that, Hagrid." [removed] Important parts are locked in. And not cutscenes damnit. Hagrid's cannon just takes control when the plot lines arrive. Let's say you're out in the Forbidden Forest searching for some creatures (I'm thinking of this as Fallout style, freedom with optional things to do and the entirety of Hogwarts + anywhere hagrid went during the plot to explore), the game realizes "Ok I have just enough time to make it back to my correct position when Harry and FriendsTM show up in relation to the plot", and takes control, walks you back home, puts you at the right place in the house even, so you're doing whatever he was doing in the movies when they show up.  I mean this is Hagrid, how much damage can he do? magic I do! It's great! Sitting in wizard pubs, hearing all kinds of crazy side stories! Same here man. Made it about 150 days before the crushing loneliness convinced me to murder myself and Chester in a fit of boredom. Don't Starve Together is a good fix for that issue though!  RemindMe! 8pm Always wished I could jump off the horse and get a few whacks in there myself Oh god, why did they do that! Hahaha. What the hell is that ?

For the record that's what Jim Power is supposed to look like: https://youtu.be/OpaFi5VjS1M Dear god it hurts the eyes! Haha, that's just an emulator glitch. Someone got a bit too peter molyneux trying to switch it up, who the fuck actually thought this was a good idea Wow I actually really like it. The musics good, the controls seem tight. Its fast paced, level design isn't amazing but at least you don't have unavoidable shit. Yeh it's absolutely mad how many games come out for iOS now.  So much stuff flying under the radar.  PC games will be like that soon enough. O.o [Parallax](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/d/d8/Parallax.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141017093607) >I am lost too. But I guess it's the layers of background moving at different speeds as you go through the level. 

That's exactly it!  I agree.  I do try to post gameplay, but I can really only go off trailers at the moment (usually the games aren't out when I first post about them).  Often times the trailer doesn't really represent what the game is like unfortunately.  :(

 This is why I dropped money on black desert even though I don't really play much at all anymore. I watched a bunch of random YouTubers play it and liked the action part, watching their videos one would think it's a waifu sim... Yep that's part of the reason why the site is designed for quick visual info.  Also it's not reliant on ads (and probably won't ever be) so I don't care if you follow on Tumblr/Instagram and never visit.

Once people are sharing I'm happy. No problem, thanks for the feedback. :) early-access isn't really a system, more of a label game devs or publishers put on their unfinished, but playable game. It's like a more modern word for an open beta. the game that pretty much started this trend was, as per usual as far as indie trendsetters go, Minecraft. Greenlight is basically a game-concept voting contest afaik. It isn't that great, since many greenlit titles are never finished when some polished gems don't ever reach the light of day. True, but I rarely see games go to greenlight, then release the same month.
 Haha that last one was great.  Eastshade is a walking sim, Totem is an adventure game in a glitchy world.   

Your others were spot on though.  Especially Yono (dev takes a lot of inspiration from Minish Cap). Their art style is amazing.  If you're interested follow @grinningpickle (the devs) on twitter.  They tweet a lot of their art experimentations, it's great.  [Website is here.](http://www.totemteller.com/) Thanks, I need all the luck. :P Yeh sorry about that.  It does cut out some users due to performance (and internet actually).  I spent a lot of time thinking about it, but ended up going with the autoloading gifs as having to click on stuff is a pain and I wanted the site to just be moving as you landed.  My inbox is a bit swamped at the moment so I can't go into all the detail of the stuff I tried, post counts, infinite scrolling, lazy loading etc. etc.

I still think about a better way to do it, but every option makes it inconvenient for another set of users.  Web design is tough. >.<

Thanks a lot for the feedback, sorry about the performance stuff.  I'll keep thinking about it. Something something gorilla man Don't let that Keep you from trying. Yeah, generalizing is not the way to go. But sure, his comments can be applied to many things (I am not getting exited by most AAA trailers either because most of them just show of flashy action and graphics..).


I just feel that many people (at least me) have a higher bar for indie titles because they often actually bring something fresh and new to the scene and it's kinda disappointing when they don't. Meanwhile we (I) all know that AAA titles (in most cases) just rerelease/paint over old concepts. (Wether or not this is fair; I don't think so, but it kinda is something I can't disable) >Next year maybe, but probably not any time soon.

T-T You are wrong.... this is the mean thing you said  > Yer a wizard! Will this make you believe me? (435 Gold)

I love when they let you shove gold at people to convince them of stupid shit. 

I remember the quest for Molag Bal's mace was a prime example of this. You need to rescue a enemy priest so Molag can torture kill and enslave his spirit. You rescue the priest and the priest is obviously skeptical as to why someone would show up and save them. Instead of following their suspicion that hey, this guy is trying to fucking kill me and sell my soul to a demon, I'll take a few hundred gold and just accept this. What? Stuff that smug little bastard in a Soul Gem and make my own damn prophecy.

Fuck it, take my money. Neville would just take over the prophecy
 Now I NEED a Harry Potter's Creed game Ezio Potter confirmed I shouldn't have done that. I should NOT have done that.  The difference between you and me is that i NEVER go back to the carpet store. /r/unexpectedrickandmorty Came here to post this, you beat me to it. Take your upvote.  That's enough game developing for you Satan Hagrid isn't able to ride his griffin, thus Draco kills Dombledoor. Voldemort quick scopes Harry, then Harry uses his soul to revive the griffin. Hagrid gets bloodlusted and decaps Voldemort in a 1 v 1. 

In the epilogue, Snape lives and invites Gondorf to smoke to magic weed while Hagrid rides a dragon into the sunset. >Hagrid's cannon

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Oh god, my best/worst memory of Don't Starve Together involves two friends and I.  One of the friends hadn't played before and we were trying to teach him the basics.  We started off in foraging mode, as was our strategy for the first few days.  My friends went off in one direction while I explored the other.

Wasn't long before I thought I hit the jackpot.  In the middle of a random patch was a fridge!  A fridge this early would be amazing!  Regardless of what was inside, I could hammer it down for a lot of rare materials to give us a big boost.  But there was also a chest nearby, so I opened it.

WHAM

Immediate winter starts.  My friend on the other side of the world shouts "What the fuck!" and I'm sheepishly forced to admit it was my fault.  We all froze to death.  Still laugh about it to this day. it feels like a circular stage imo
 
like he's running around in circles

no escape

no hope See, that's how I go through life. I don't know shit, but somehow always figure things out. A day will come when my wits won't be enough. minecraft was never in early-access. it's not on steam. it was sold as an alpha-product, then a beta-product, then in full release.

did it really set the trend for early-access on steam? does e.a. exist outside of steam? No problem, I don't have that much of a problem with it. As I said, it was only because I had a fullscreen 1080p YT vid running, when I turned it off and went back to your site, I noticed no lag whatsoever. But maybe some people with less powerful PCs and/or internet connection will notice it.

I'm a software developer and I also do a little web design for our software, so I know it can be a pain in the ass (although you most likely have more experience than I do).
How about a compromise? Load one gif per article and make the other static images until you click them. Maybe this will help performance wise.

Kudos to you that you're designing the website by yourself and also filling it with content. I'm sure that's a time consuming job. All true, but I'd say this game isn't really run of the mill (to me anyway).  The only thing like it (recently) is Kingdom, which has a different play style entirely.  So while the actual game play of combat has been done, and the survival aspects have been done in other games, it's really not your standard "pixel art side scroller".

It's taken a lot of things that have been done before and mashed them into something else that really hasn't.  I understand if that's not enough to pique your interest, I just take issue with writing it off as "standard".

I realise this isn't what you were saying, just expanding on what I meant.

 http://i.imgur.com/VL05sbm.gifv This was precisely the quest I was thinking of. He immediately called my bluff on the lie (called to action by his diety) which, frankly didn't seem that unrealistic to me. 

Instead he's like "*nope nobody could know, please get fucked*" and so we have the options of

Let me free you

*or*

Leave you bound like a pig on a mountain with all the people I just killed after you just told me *not even your god knows where to find you*

Instead I paid money to *allow me to free him*

I'm so mad I couldn't leave him and go back to Molag Bal like "yeah, he died. Do you have someone else we can use" Do it following James and the gang as they get up to mischief. A Salazar's Creed Are you sure there's any 'magic weed' left after you finished with it? What, that can happen in Don't Starve? Just opening a chest turns it into immediate winter? I had a fun DST game once. Was playing on a public server, 10 strangers and we were all cooperating so well, working together on one big base. Well, all of the sudden we notice all of the gold has been taken from our chests, and no one is admitting that they were the one to take it. People start getting angry, accusing each other, and before you know it all the trust it gone, people are hoarding their items and have taken everything out of the chests. A few of the 10 remain at the base, but at this point I’ve long since grabbed what I could and ran out to survive on my own. 

As tensions are rising, and people begin dying left and right, I begin to rally some of the others into believing the person playing the Librarian is the one who stole all of the gold. They won’t admit it, they won’t deny it, which causes the group to grow even more angry.

At this point I know I need that gold to survive, so I grab the only leverage I can- the Librarian had stored some of their things in chester, which I immediately grab and steal for myself.

“So, you don’t have the gold, huh? That’s a shame.  I’d also be a shame if something happened to all of these stacks of grass and twigs”

“No….please. Please don’t do it” the Librarian begins to beg. “I don’t have the gold, I swear”, the Librarian finally admits they don’t have the gold, but at this point it is too late.


“Hm,” I equip a lit torch, and throw the twigs/grass piles on the ground. “A reaaaaaal shame then” By the time I enter the message, the materials are already lit aflame, half an hour of the LIbrarian’s gathering has just been turned to ash. 

“Nooooooooooooooooo” is all the Librarian can manage to let out. It is winter by now, and without the needed materials to make a fire/keep warm, she is dead by the end of the night.

Having been waiting nearby, I quickly run in to loot her corpse. But among the many things...there is no gold. No gold? No gold?! Did she leave it somewhere? She HAD to be the one with the gold, pretty much everyone else was dead at this point!

I wandered around, panicked. 8 of the 10 players were dead at this point (the only other survivor abandoned ship after the missing gold episode like I did), and as you recall dead players drain the sanity of living ones, so I NEEDED that gold to live. In one last ditch effort, I run back to the original camp where everything had started…

And see one more corpse was there than before. Some random player, quiet, who had never really said a word all game. Dead, under a pocket lighter, a half used spear, and a pile of gold ore that was so big you could barely see the skeleton under it.

I actually added the Librarian after that game. They admitted later they didn’t fess up about not having the gold early on because they were loving all the drama that was ensuing.  My favorite moment of that game was when I was playing with a friend, cutting trees down and the big ass tree spawns. 

I panic, don't have weapons wtf do I do. So beeing a smartass I tried to jokingly plant trees so he could be my friend. Turns out that worked. One of my favorit gaming moments by far. Lol holy shit yeah, sounds like my first playthrough. Except I didn't have to open any chest, I just froze to death in my stupidity. Eventually I'll get the game for the PS4 for me and my gf, whenever she's done with the new Pokémon xD Well I'm not still designing it haha, getting it to work right was so stressful!  Still things that I need to clean up but I keep putting it off.  I'm more info game development than web.

I'll keep that idea in mind though, this has been really good for feedback as I don't usually get people talking about problems (those users just leave).  So thanks for that! That kid sure does like his dinner. How they mercilessly outnumber Snape and bully him 😂😂 But we already know how that story arc ends.. that's what the magic is for, duh It's a specific random trap that can spawn.  Looks like a little patch of snow with a fridge, a chest, and a thermometer.  Opening the chest causes Winter to start, or resets it to Day 1 of Winter if you're already in that season.

It's hilarious if you aren't expecting it.  We still start games of Don't Starve Together with "Remember, if you see a fridge and a chest, DO NOT OPEN IT." You injected a game of Werewolf into your Don't Starve Together server.  I love it.

Was half expecting the story to end "IT WAS ME!  I TOOK THE GOLD!" It's called Pokémon Sun or Moon. Pokémon XD was on Gamecube. No problem, I know it's hard. And when you get feedback, often it's something that makes you think "Dude, really? This is a problem for you? Are you serious right now?". It's hard to evaluate what really is a problem with your software or if it's just one or two isolated cases of personal preference.

General rule of thumb for me is 1) if you had doubts about a feature/thing yourself and 2) if not one or two but a few people are pointing out something, it's worth looking into and considering changing it - even if you think it's not the way you'd want it to work. It's not the destination but the journey. What about the fridge itself? Can you salvage it or does that set off the trap too? 

I'm afraid to go near the Don't Starve Wiki because it always sucks me in for hours at a time... Haha, that's just devious. I remember being decently well prepared for my winter and still almost running out of food and freezing to death when I ventured away for it. Then I tried setting a treeguard on fire and was one-shotted even with log armour :( The funnies part is that fits so well with your username xD  It would have better if the librarian said, "you were expecting gold, but it was me, DIO!!"  I know what you did there, but Pokémon XD was a really badass game. My jackass friend stole my Lv 100 Blaziken from Ruby and put it on his copy of the game though  Hehe hitting the nail on the head.  Praise be to anyone who does this full time. exactly so dont give me the option to exit the animus! Touché. It would be interesting to see their story and how they fought He Who Shall Not Be Named back before Harry's time. You can salvage the fridge no problem, which is good because you can get an easy Gear out of it for building one in your base. I've never survived Winter because my friend always attacks the penguins.  Came really close, but nope.  He had to go hit the penguins. Roundabout starts to play. Hagrid Simulator Wow, looks great. I love the contrast of the slow pace of the day versus night. In the day you can fish, cut trees, hunt etc. while at night you have to defend yourself.  Sort of a survival/action game, for Windows, Mac, Linux.  Not sure of the release date (next year sometime I think?).

[Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJptLWXRm2Y)  It recently got through [Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=792383821).

 wow kinda reminds me of hyperlight drifers pixel art style.  For the love of god please come to consoles, this looks super fun.  This one's a Keeper. Perrin Aybara One of the enemies looks inspired by "attack on Titan"? This looks fantastic, reminds me of Kingdom. Will definitely pick it up when it releases.


It's weird, there's so many great pixel art games coming out recently. 2D Pixels for life y'all. 3D is overrated. Is this the 2-D brawler/platformer that can fill the void in my heart that Terraria left behind? I WANT IT
AND I WANT IT NOW This looks fun.  I will look for it when it hits the store. Is this a real game?  Awesome looking game! can it be on Vita? I was thinking to myself "what a peaceful game", and then I saw the flash of lightning and thought to myself "were those bodies hanging from the trees?". Then dude rolls and smashes other guy's head in with an axe! This would be great with about 4 times the pixels. I'm on a Pixel game fix (HLD, Kingdom 1 and 2), so I will definitely been looking forward to this.  Is this for console,PC, or mobile? Same developer as Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery? Looks a lot like Rogue Legacy. Graphic wise. Man I'm gonna get this sucker when it comes out!  That looks as fun as Gunpoint! Alright, what direction should I throw my money this time?  But, where is Drowzee? Ok so i need this game now I'll never get tired of 2D sidescrollers, they've remained my favorite genre ever since I was a kid and there's no genre that gives me a higher feeling of immersion (not even first-person games, surprisingly).

This one looks great, the art style has that warm, familiar, soothing look to it that a lot of the best 2D sidescrollers tend to go for. I NEED IT. Hi brother. This reminds me a bit of superbrothers: sword and sworcery.  Dan Harmon: The Game is out!?! Am I the only one who thought "risk of rain?" Exact same art style and that roll is spot on if there's someone in this thread who wants to make games for a living. I would buy any game that looks just like this. Pixel art is amazing and we DONT have enough games that do them properly Sandor? I thought this was Kingdom: New Lands for a second. Great game btw. Reminds me of Logen Ninefingers A quick google of "the keeper" returned a menstrual cup instead of this game.  Vi-ta! Vi-ta! Vi-ta! The Hound Simulator This reminds if a little game called "witchmarsh" Those animations are so SMOOTH! This game is what my soul goes through on Mondays.  Looks like Shovel Knight meets Broforce. This reminds me of that old samurai Jack flash game that was free to play on cartoon networks website. Another pixel indie game huh. I kinda get a "under the sea/garden" vibe from it.  Looks good :) 
 Ok this looks sweet Looks awesome, I hope it's not another "survival rouge-like indie trash with souls difficulty" game
I absolutely despise indie games that try too be hardcore, I just want to play casual platformers, beat em ups and such. A Pixel indie side-scroller?! Wow never seen anything like it. Damn that looks badass as heck. I like the survival aspect of it as well. /r/noisygifs In the days of easy and free access to Unity and Unreal engines I really don't get the need for every indie game to be pixel art anymore. Gameplay looks great though. That hand movement when he's working on his bench looks so good, Jesus. That alone got me interested. How do I play this game? and...he's doing typical dumb video game shit...what else you got? Wow, this looks beautiful.  I really hope that events like when the swordsman pulls you out of the tower are spread throughout the game, it looks really cool. Seems like a fun game. Sweet trailer. I just get the feeling it's kind of a spoiler as too what you'll encounter story and enemy wise.

Please tell me there's much more to it?:) Dan Harmon simulator?  This game would be great for ios/android! Welp, my interest is officially piqued. Yes, please. Tom Bombadil - the game. Damn, those bodies hanging from the tree gave me chills.

This looks amazing. The new God of War looks great Looks good  Lumberjack vs Zombies I love 8 bit games.  
Just sayin. Just beautiful. Love it. Your gif made me want to play a game. After watching a video trailer I am not so sure anymore. You did a great job. Keep it up. "But pixelated graphics are just a excuse to make a game ugly for cheap, blah blah blah" RemindMe! 72 hours Huh, super cool looking. Definitely gonna keep an eye out for this. This looks fucking awesome, I'm 100% sure I'm going to get my ass handed to me uncountable times, but I look forward to it What do you plan to price It? I want to save up. The trailer music and scenery was absolutely beautiful, by the way. Whoever made the music should be pat on the back. This game looks AWESOME  remind me of castlevania, i like this style  I think The Keeper has some inner demons to face . This reminds me of Bunyan, the lone woodsman featured in the Breath of Fire series, master fighter, wise world-worn all around badass. Remindme! 1 year This isn't gonna be on console, huh? :( But can you play that with an ultrabook and one of those cpu-integrated intel HD graphics cards?

I'm seriously asking. Because Diablo 3 is best played on my laptop at a maximum of 15fps (that's the lowest setting. I wish I could go lower). Do want! This looks awesome. Looka pretty good. I would play it. The one thing I like and think Terraria should add is the way the buildings work. Imagine in Terraria that when you exit a building it becomes background to you could walk past it instead of through it. And then when you go into the building it comes up the the foreground again.  all i can see is a medieval trucker's delight. Reminds me of The Hound circa Season 6 GOT. Is that wreck It Ralph? Judging by the art style it's the same authors as the Kingdom: New Lands. Looks good, I'll check it out. I had no idea Hagrid was so violent. This looks awesome, looking forward to it in the future  Is it coming on iOS?  My only criticism is that it isn't an overhead view like Zelda. I feel the horizontal scrolling format isn't gonna keep me interested but ya never know, it looks awesome otherwise  Great soundtrack, it encapsulates a lot of different emotions depending on scenery in a very smooth way!  Those opening scenes are beautiful, I have a macbook pro, is there anyway to have something like those opening screens as a wallpaper, like an actually moving wallpaper? did you use game maker to make this game?

looks beautifull btw, congrats! Been following this one for awhile. Looks great. Is this already out?  Ninja Gai Fieri Wish this was coming to iOS. I have been scouring for a good mobile game. I cant find this on the steam store? Did he just punch that dude in the face? Looks like the new god of war to me. Wow. Great sprite work! Is this released yet? If not, when? Weeeeell, I'm extremely sold. This is exactly my type of game. Could a game like this have been made on old consoles of the day? what prevents something like this from being made at that time? Looks awesome. Is this a one man operation? If so.. Wow. Finally a game where i can play as Ron Swanson. Reminds me a bit of Superbrothers:S&S. The graphic style looks almost identical to Crawl. Magnus Burnside? That is virtually unwatchable in full-screen looks sweet, hope it gets an IOS port eventually Probably my favorite move is the fact that you can punch a baddy straight up in the face. Those hanging corpses that are, but aren't in the tree... Spooky man. This oozes atmosphere. I'll be watching this! This reminds me of samurai jack but with more gore When can I play this I can't find a release date / month / quarter for this. Does greenlit mean weeks, months, unknown? Any further release info? Release date? Bunyan... is that you? Bombadillo simulator! Looks fun, I hope it has enough gameplay features to not get boring This graphic and fight style reminde me of [Not a Hero](http://store.steampowered.com/app/274270), hope it's as good. This one's a keeper. Reminds me of the Woodsman from Over the Garden Wall How can i design that graphs? Which program? Wow, just replace the main character and that' what I've always wanted from a Samurai Jack video game. Wow this game is right up my street. Can't wait. It looks kinda like Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery Love those combat animations.  It seems so difficult to make characters physically interact like that. Mmm i like it. I'll keep an eye on it Looks a bit like Superbrothers: Sword and Sorcery Made by the same people that made Kingdom I would assume. Great game to check out btw guys, looks exactly like this. Looks like Guacamelee
 Reminds me of the Scottish dude from Samurai Jack That was very peaceful until it wasn't  Hehe, that would be a pretty neat concept. *Andre* simulator more The Scotsman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEWv9RpE_vs Haven't laughed this hard in a while... i would buy it if you make it, it would be comfy as fuck as well. Like harvest moon but 2d  Combat reminds me of The Mark of the Kri *confused with hodor* Night does look really amped up, love the roll into the axe swing animation.  I wonder how long the two periods are as the day does look relaxing, unlike Kingdom or Don't Starve. So its [Kingdom: New Lands](http://store.steampowered.com/app/496300) but you do the fighting instead of building/training a town/army
 The only thing I have to say is that the parralax is freaking sexy in this game.  So you're pretty much the Hound in the Long Night 2? Looks cool. I like your website. The best game review in my opinion is a clip or two of what playing the game is like. This is a quick way to get a taste for a lot of games. It kin of looks like it has combos, similar to how Guacamelee does. Can anyone verify that or not? You should make it a subreddit too so I don't have to leave my cozy reddit ecosystem. When it turns night a text box  should come out slowly typing out "WHAT A HORRIBLE NIGHT TO HAVE A CURSE." and then dope ass music starts playing I'm not familiar w/ greenlighting process.

Is this game just entering development, or nearly finished? Is there a release date?

there is not page for this on the steam store so I can't add it to wishlist. I guess following it is the closest thing. Looks like the exact art style from Kindgom: New Lands, sounds like similar gameplay too, I'm down! Dude, freaking lovely website. No apologies needed, fantastic content.  I like your site,  Please keep it up! :)
The loop gameplay GIF(?) is large and I like it, more interesting than static screenshot, but less overhead to watch than video. Made for lazy bum like me! Can you recommend your favorite Indie games that you've covered since you started your Daily?  Maybe top 5 or 6? Love your site, thanks for sharing Your site is brilliant. An excellent resource for indie goodness. I really expected him to just kill the butterfly and go "None shall pass", given the title. >so you can judge stuff quickly

You know your audience well I just wanted to say I love your website. I can't believe how many cool games are on there! I am following you on twitter since a few months ago. Found some games that I liked because of you, thanks! i like it Just wanted to say i love your site. The focus on the visual artistic aspect of the games is great, and the minimalistic approach on information and details is just enough to spark my interest for a lot of these games. Two thumbs up! At 2:00 The enemy throws a knife, and he grabs the knife MIDAIR and then stabs the enemy right in the eye. Seems like its going to be a great game with level of detail.
 I know some people may complain, but why not monetize part of it with banner ads? Not intrusive, a lot of people use ad block anyway so if they're upset enough then they'll block it on their own. If it's your own work and project, there's no shame in advertising for it. That's basically the only way to grow anyway at the beginning Whoa whoa whoa, was that a Titan in the trailer? So the poor guy never gets to sleep. The animations while he is fishing, and when the enemy jumps in the air, look reminiscent to Shovel Knight PSVita Version pretty please? Seems great. Not a fan of the music, though. Thanks for the info and your website is really nice. Especially well optimized for mobile. Great job!  hopefully this will fill the stardew valley shaped hole in me It's really nice to see some pixel art that doesn't have really low fps animations! Thanks for the info, and I also took a look at your site and I would like to read more. One thing, though: Don't make all gifs appear on your frontpage and load them all simultaneously. This kills performance and sucks data from mobile users.

Good job though, keep it going! Could use someone sifting through  all those indie games and dig up the worthy looking ones and summarize what they're about. Is there a subreddit for games like this? 1:50 Shingeki no Kyoujin?

2:07 Neon Genesis Evangelion?

How many references did I miss? Who paid you to post this? 1:50 Wtf that Attack on titan reference haha Thank you for this, it's always nice with new or more indie games.  

This one looks both pretty and badass.   So, 2D Minecraft without the building but with vastly superior art? Can't a poor Viking dude get any sleep around here? The screen shaking is giving me a headache. :( Otherwise looks awesome. (: Looks cool thanks RemindMe! Sometime in 2017 I think. Keep it up! Remindme! 6months > Greenlight

Your blog is great. I've already made note of a couple of games I'd like to have in the future. Nice concept.  Amazing art style But when does he sleep? That game's death and fighting animations reminds me of Dustforce. RemindMe! 9pm Simon's quest? This looks super cool dude. How can i follow this project so i dont forget when its released? I really like quality pixel art and this looks like an interesting game. (im kinda new to steam) Aw, it looked good, but "survival" killed it for me.  Release it for iOS? Looks like it was made by the people who did bro-force. It looks fantastic. So when does he sleep? Is the artist from r/gamedevclassifieds? I feel like i recognise this character and art style :) !Remindme 2 hours damnnnnnn Prithee, be careful.  That was definitely my first thought too.  *double bass kick* No no no, it says The Keeper, not Eve "Castlevania 1 didn't have that shit, it just had goofy skeletons throwing bones..." I missed The Black Dahlia Murder in Baltimore a few weeks ago. My buddy went and said they play so much of "Nocturnal." So sad I didn't go :/ Tell me you've seen their live DVD? It's fucking amazing.  >dang

no swears pls thx It reminded me of Roger from American Dad. I think that part of the gif is the DEFINITION of that. Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to watch the language  "You botherin' me at night, when I don't got any fishin' to do? That's a good way to GET PUNCHED"  
-What I imagine he said- Yes seems like he can do everything, cook, clean, slay evil spirits.  What a catch! Which I like way better  There's the /r/bindingofisaac leak I was looking for.  If he can take more than two hits or is eligible for any health upgrades whatsoever then what's even the point of playing? I hope so. He's pretty worthless without it. had to control+f to find this.  the pixel animation style and lightning made me think of it instantly.  i wonder if you'll have to fight a grizzled boor. We found an old game to go back to and it was awesome

*dramatic music and pan out to white* I love that game. God I loved sword and sworcery, one of the best games I have played imhop. I thought the same, is it made by the same people? the final boss is a mannequin leg. I thought this was the Community 8 bit game at first. OOoooo, that's perfect. \#NotMyKeeper I was scrolling the comments to find someone else who saw the similarity haha.  Does it?  Feels different to me, both look pretty good though (but I prefer HLD's). Nice one, Dad! Also the blood moon with the creepy guy in the lake reminds me of "Berserk" I'm not seeing it. It looks like a pretty standard Samurai-themed enemy with the cloak and hat, the lightning flash, and the heavy blade.

Edit: Ok, I see that he's referring to the trailer now. I only saw the GIF, since videos are blocked on my network. How is kingdom?  What's good about it? I don't think so.  It might tickle it maybe?  But I don't think it has the same depth at all. Yup! Like owlboy? Risk of Rain and Terraria should be on your radar. Windows, Mac, Linux for now.  I'm not sure if anything else is in the works. Oh man!  I'm so sorry, meant to reply to you earlier but you got lost in the deluge.

[Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.](http://i.imgur.com/MpzuCeq.gifv) Now that you mention it... yeah.  That looks very cool also! You get to fish on Mondays?!  Lucky! Whatever happened to that? I bought into the early access of under the ocean and it seems abandoned. Unless I'm thinking of the wrong game.... You can't blame them. Every designer dreamed of trashing the player and forcing them to master the game. Every designer wants his game to succeed as a test of dedication.

Before Demon Souls the consensus was easier = more money and designers have to eat. But after that game's wide appeal now they feel they can achieve their dream. Make a game 100,000 might play and quit, but 10,000 will enjoy eating shit until they master it.

It's the same concept as esports really. In that group too you get trashed until you learn. Everything has been done before.  What game gets you excited? 
>badass as heck

Stealing this. Pixel art is beautiful and simple which makes it easier to make unique art for your game. Just grabbing some 3D assets and stylizing them a bit doesn't look as good IMO. We also don't need every game feeling like a Unity game though. Of course, one in ten developers can make it not feel like another engine rehash, but the concept remains.

It is good to have variety, be it Unity, Pixel, Unreal, or some other in house. It's easier to make. 

People can say it's artistic choice or whatever, but at the end of the day pixel art requires less talent so way more people are going to use it. Keyboard and mouse I think?  Not sure if there's controller support. Not my game, but I hope so! Not sure about Mac, for PC there's a program you can use for moving backgrounds.  Can't remember the name at the moment though. None that I know of :( This looks like something you can do on Unity. Hagrid's daily life, in nice graphics, you play out the Harry Potter series over the years from Hagrid's perspective, day by day, year by year, with the ability to skip forward to the interesting events of the HP plot all the way until the end.

Edit to elaborate, since I keep thinking about the idea: Like a weird version Skyrim or Fallout where it's open world with optional quests, except instead of you having to choose between the plot and side quests, you explore the wizard world however you want and the plot just inevitably comes to you here and there. Tons of weird side stories going on all the time whether you're watching them or not, conversations had in pubs that you'll never know about unless you're there at the right time. Game takes control of Hagrid just in time to walk him back to where he needs to be to meet the important plot interactions of HP, and you get to watch him and the other characters experience those memorable scenes at all his significant moments during the books, before regaining control to explore. 

Sounds like an awesome concept... too bad it would require some sort of AI to generate the side story content somehow. Way too many man hours involved in manually writing content to fill all of the open world areas with interesting things for almost a decade. Just the fact that there aren't set events triggered to initiate storylines, but rather hundreds of interesting things are going on around the world at any given time and you'll never have time to explore all of them in your lifetime, it'd be pretty neat. AI could make this kind of experience possible. http://m.memegen.com/xqyxtw.jpg *Do come back alive...* I've never played a game that requires such constant vigilance like don't starve. I can't eat or drink and am usually holding my breath. My first thought exactly.  And it's a good thing. Oh wow didn't that start as a flash game on newgrounds? Cool to see the creator was able to make it a full game. It's an interesting concept but I feel like it could've been more complex while maintaining its simplicity.  
Also bothered by - spoilers ahead - the poor ending.  
I hope they won't be afraid to be more intricate with this one. How is that game? Sounds like a fun concept! The concept goes as far back as Castlevania for the NES.  Thought K:NL looked really cool, went to steam to check it out.  

Of course it's already in my library, and as usual I'm not sure how it got there (probably bundles). sounds awesome If you like parallax check out [Samurai Blitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yto0Fd6iaU#t=6s). Hi, I"m dumb. What's parallax in this context? Preorder and get the fawukin' chicken expansion > So you're pretty much the Hound in the Long Night 2? 

Nah, pretty much Don't Starve Thanks!  It's definitely meant to be quick.  I guess since I've been influenced a lot by reddit I like to be shown something before I have to read. From the game's [steam page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=792383821):

>"...a combat system focused on combos, executions, defense and counterattacks." God, that games combo system was so satisfying and rewarding without needing to be super deep. I need a sequel or another Metroidvania game that feels like it.

Such a great game.. Feels like I'm already spread too thin!  Not enough butter spread on too much bread something something ~Bilbo

You can go through my submission history if you want the highlights though. =) *This twisted wretched place shadowed by the utmost darks of hell* I'm not sure whether it's early or late in dev.  I think more to the early side.  No release date yet (as far as I know).  You'll have to follow it, usually once the Steam store page opens you'll get a update/notification.

Greenlight is just a voting process on Steam where approved games are allowed to be released on the platform.  You can submit whatever to Greenlight, so it could be an early concept or a finished game. It means the game has enough done to be able to show off at least a trailer of gameplay.  The purpose of it is to help the developer with a guaranteed method of publishing.  Think of how much it would suck to finish working on a game, but have it be rejected from Steam or other distribution platforms.  Once your project is Greenlit, you can breathe a small sigh of relief that your game will have a home on a store shelf when it is ready.  

Contrast this to frantically, pennilessly (because you just spent the past 2 years developing this thing full time) Trying to get someone to put your finished game on their shelf so that you can pay your rent next month.  The earlier in the process THAT part gets done, the better. Greenlight is a stage in game development where an idea or a prototype for a game is cast into the public, and they vote for it. 

Popular ideas may at some point be "lit", which means that when finished they can be sold on Steam. 

It's basically a way for Steam to filter the good stuff out from the indies.

As for this game.. if it only just greenlighted, it won't be released any time soon. in some case it's just a concept or a very early build of a game but in other cases, the game is finished but the developer can't convince Steam to put it in their store. These devs may even alter their game multiple times to fit the requirements that Steam asks of them and still fail to get accepted by Valve. So The greenlight process is way for these types of developers to get into steam via popular vote ( there has to be a larger "yes" vote than a "no" vote) even though they haven't been recognized by Valve previously.

Which means if the game becomes completed as per the developer's goals, then the Steam will put it up on their Store.  Some of these games become part of the Early Access program and some don't. That's why you can see games within the Greenlight system that hasn't popped up in Early Access or haven't popped up in the store yet. The devs are taking their time to build it properly knowing they got a seat in Steam waiting for them. 

here's a better explanation:
https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/tips-for-getting-greenlit-on-steam-greenlight--gamedev-13938 Thanks!  There really is a lot of cool stuff on the horizon, indie games are getting better and better.  Great time to be a gamer I think. I'm a lazy bum too, so I made it for me as well. =) [Gris

Sorry I can't provide more links (working overtime atm)!  Any questions feel free.

 This is an awesome question, I'm flooded at the moment.  Give me some time to answer. :) Thanks!  That means a lot. :) Thanks!  And I can't cover them all.  Imagine five years from now, we'll be flooded with goodies. O.O Super neat to meet a follower in the wild.  Hai!  =) Yay :) I hate banner ads myself, plus feels like it would spoil the aesthetic of the site.  Also, the traffic isn't enough for the money to be worth it anyway.  I think I'd prefer to do something like donations/patreon, probably not as much money but keeps it separated and less intrusive.  That's way in the future though. :)

>If it's your own work and project, there's no shame in advertising for it.

I guess, but I don't want to be seen as a shill for my own stuff.  I'm really here to show off a cool game, and I'm kind sneaking in my site. >.<

Thanks for the reply! Thanks that's good to know, don't often hear from mobile users.  The gifs shouldn't load on mobile, unless you're using Mozilla which unfortunately I can't fix at the moment.   :(

Thanks for the feedback! Mmm, /r/indiegaming?

Not sure if that's exactly what you're looking for. haha good time! Neato, glad to hear! There's a follow button on Steam if you're logged in, beneath the trailer.  Also on the right is the link to their Twitter/Facebook so you can follow there. Glad I'm not the only one who immediately thought of The Black Dahlia Murder. Thank you. I think you might be the only that knows I'm referring to Castlevania II, haha. 

Fun game if you played it with a Nintendo Power and always had a pen and paper to write things down nearby.

I don't think AVGN had such luxuries  That's a bummer. I still hold Nocturnal as the best metal album released in the past 10 years.  Haha, I'm aware of them but haven't listened to them. 

I actually remember this line from owning Castlevania II, and the night and day mechanic  Flip the POlice r/madlads o heck https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/nov/20/full-of-hot-air-row-in-canadian-parliament-over-the-word-fart-video Yeah he was losin' it.  
I *punch* HAVE HAD *punch* ENOUGH *punch* of YOU!  >Yes seems like he can do everything, cook, clean, slay evil spirits. What a ~~catch~~ Keeper!


FTFY Is he single ;) That's exactly what I did, lol. God that was a great episode To be fair it's a bit apples and oranges. This one seems a bit more grounded in reality as far as its pallets go, where as HLD was basically adventure time levels of colorful.  It's got that same immersive pixel art feeling. The gameplay is definitely different just the artstyle when I look at the trees and character models.  He's talking about the trailer posted in the top comment, I think, because there's a big humanoid with no skin that looks a lot like a titan in that video. Well it looks legit, regardless. Good work Name? cool Risk of Rain, got it on my list, thanks man. Me and my brothers have been making good play of Terraria for years though. I've personally bought it for three different platforms (mobile, PS4 and Vita)  Oh ok thanks! Tbh I get his point. I like pixel art indie games but it kinda gets old. It's hard (at least for me) to get exited over those trailers if no special innovative gameplay feature is shown.



While this game looks really nice, the gameplay shown is average to me. 
Don't get me wrong,  this probably is a really fun game, it's just that the trailer doesn't do much for me (I'll keep an eye on it though). Pixel art is beautiful but the blocky, minimal approach seen here and dozens of other games gets old fast. For once I'd love to see a game [REALLY explore](http://i.imgur.com/2IBbvYv.gif) what can be done with pixel graphics. I am sorry. I mean. How do I download and play this game. I can't seem to pay for it. rainmeter > Like a weird version Skyrim or Fallout

    
A) (Yes) Yer a wizard, Harry!

B) (No) Yer not a wizard, Harry!

C) (Sarcasm) Sure, Yer a wizard, Harry!

D) (Leave) What happens if you stray from the plot? You need to be watching WestWorld, sir! You're watching Westworld, right? I can't upvote this enough. Such a great concept! > hundreds of interesting things are going on around the world at any given time and you'll never have time to explore all of them in your lifetime

honestly even as a huge HP fan, take HP completely out of this and make it any genre of RPG and it would be sick lol  Literally cleaning up monster shit for hours a day. Sounds a bit like the game of Life.  Basically, "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" for gaming. It was definitely stressful.  Much prefer to play those types of games co-op.  The laughter helps with the impending doom. Dying (or the looming threat of dying) in don't starve is half the experience of don't starve. The game becomes boring once you've become unkillable. Agreed, opens up some new gameplay while having a similar feel. It did! It's a great casual game to pass the time, and New Lands is a great addition to the game. I played the original Kingdom a lot, haven't played New Lands too much but it looks like it improves on the formula. 

Very chill and relaxing, with atmospheric music and a nice art style (with some randomness to keep it all from getting stale too quickly). 

The mechanics are simple and it's not that deep, but it's still charming and unique. Definitely worth checking out! >Soon on Android.

They're breaking my heart keeping this game only on IOS. If you like parallax, don't check out Jim power on SNES

https://youtu.be/_WGIQpVUDEQ    It reminds me of my favorite game as a kid, [Shinobi 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prZAjV0pGAc). Cool thanks!

I've actually been on an iOS buying kick. There were a bunch of promos and sales for Black Friday and cyber Monday, like Final Fantasy Tactics for 3$ (from 14.99), FF7 for 3.99 (from 15.99 iirc), also picked up Lunar: Silver Story complete, i guess it's remastered or something because it looks different than my psx version, Infinity Blade 3 for .99 cents, and final fantasy MOBIUS and EXVIUS got free (that might be normal price idk).

I forgot that iOS has a lot of super legit ports of really really good JRPGs. It made me wonder what else iOS has to offer, as I usually just watch Netflix or Reddit on the go.  > parallax

I love that game, promote it every chance i get Holy shit when the guy died I was really surprised!  *Wait, what, why does the hero di...* oh my god that was fantastic! Eat the noms and revive! Fuck yeah :-D Watch the background.  The further away stuff is supposed to be, the slower it travels across the screen.  It tricks the brain into thinking there is distance. I am lost too. But I guess it's the layers of background moving at different speeds as you go through the level. Kind of a point of view thing, where layers are use to show a kind of depth in a 2D game. That's my interpretation at least. Agree with /u/epicgeek above, I am frequently frustrated seeing a game 'movie' vs actual experience and most often reconsider my purchase after watching a Let's Play from some rando streamer that has 50 views and doesn't make the game seem interesting. Instagram and Snapchat are the future my friend, like it or not. Great idea to have short clips playing in people's feeds. Much more likely to check out then a 6 min IGN review. Not a bash on them just the direction we're moving in. 
 Thank you, kind sir.  That game had some of the most satisfying combat I've ever played. I wish i could go back in time and play it over again with fresh eyes. The art and music was incredible too.  Haha okay fair enough.  Thanks for you efforts, I like what you're doing making it easy for lazy people like me to see short trailers of new games Is geenlighting is completely separate system to early-access? Plenty of fully complete games go to greenlight to be added to steam. Being lit doesn't really have any bearing on a game's progress at all. Greenlight can be all over the place. It's the easiest way to get your game up on steam regardless of its current state. Some games can be almost finished, others can be prototypes they intend to totally rebuild after greenlighting. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥This game is👌💯"lit"💯👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Indeed. I'll try and make sure to check it every now and then =). And I'm with you on the banner ads! Gris; looks like Journey 2d.

Yono; elephant zelda?

Totem Teller; no clue.

Highfleet; a weird Luftrausers.

Sea of Solitude; Submerged meets Limbo?

Eastshade; double desktop simulator?

that looks amazing It's been awhile but these suggestions were excellent! Traffic may not have been enough, but by hitting the front page of reddit you're going to be getting a *lot* more of it. I hope many site owners think the same way you do :) I like your website's idea!
Good luck! Ok, didn't try it on mobile, good on you to think about that. But also on PC, I got a YT video running on 1080p on my other window and noticed your site lagging a little while loading all those gifs. Maybe that's just my special case, though. Done. Ty! Ahh good old goofy BDM

Gorrila honing trigger finger! Forget them! Golly you're bad ....yours is better. How about he says mine right before the fight and yours while he's doing the punching? Aaawww, I always miss out on the catchy phrases.  Well done. :P [Meet local guys in Low Earth Orbit tonight!](https://xkcd.com/713/) Maybe the badass huntsman fights giants by skinning them alive? Not my work, I just post cool stuff (imo!). :) I get your point also, and thanks for fleshing it out.  I guess I was just tired of the dismissive generalisations.  His comment could be about most games tbh.  Except maybe an RTS, we need more of those. ;) I figured, I was just being mean, sowwy :)  It's not out yet, the link on Steam just means it's approved for release on Valve's platform.  I don't think there's a release date yet.  Next year maybe, but probably not any time soon. Ye must be a wizard!

Yer a wizard, Harry! (Persuade)

Yer a wizard! Will this make you believe me? (435 Gold)

Listen to me, damnit! Yer a wizard! (Intimidation)

Maybe yer not a wizard, Harry. (Lie)

Nevermind, we'll talk later. Choice E: Use that umbrella like a daedric claymore and whip it around at young 11 year old harry.
Suddenly an echo goes around the room and you hear, with this character's death, the thread of prophecy is severed. Restore a saved game to restore the weave of fate, or persist in the doomed world you have created.


Oh shit this isn't Morrowind. Nvm, he'll just be unconcious while you are fucking up his Uncle and using Avada Kedavra on Dudley only to leave your Aunt for his sick and twisted ways. *screen goes red*
DESYNCHRONIZED This guy is taking Roy off the grid! This guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy!
 Everyone else's skin starts turning grey, eyes bloodshot, they start asking questions. "why are you doing that Hagrid? You're meant to be going that way Hagrid. You shouldn't go that Hagrid." until you stray way off the path and eventually they wear their cloaks up all the time so you never see their faces, apart from glowing red eyes (not the main characters though, just red eyes and black skin for them, got to have that character recognition). Then the comments get more darker. "No Hagrid. Do NOT go that way, Hagrid. I can't let you do that, Hagrid." [removed] Important parts are locked in. And not cutscenes damnit. Hagrid's cannon just takes control when the plot lines arrive. Let's say you're out in the Forbidden Forest searching for some creatures (I'm thinking of this as Fallout style, freedom with optional things to do and the entirety of Hogwarts + anywhere hagrid went during the plot to explore), the game realizes "Ok I have just enough time to make it back to my correct position when Harry and FriendsTM show up in relation to the plot", and takes control, walks you back home, puts you at the right place in the house even, so you're doing whatever he was doing in the movies when they show up.  I mean this is Hagrid, how much damage can he do? magic I do! It's great! Sitting in wizard pubs, hearing all kinds of crazy side stories! Same here man. Made it about 150 days before the crushing loneliness convinced me to murder myself and Chester in a fit of boredom. Don't Starve Together is a good fix for that issue though!  RemindMe! 8pm Always wished I could jump off the horse and get a few whacks in there myself Oh god, why did they do that! Hahaha. What the hell is that ?

For the record that's what Jim Power is supposed to look like: https://youtu.be/OpaFi5VjS1M Dear god it hurts the eyes! Haha, that's just an emulator glitch. Someone got a bit too peter molyneux trying to switch it up, who the fuck actually thought this was a good idea Wow I actually really like it. The musics good, the controls seem tight. Its fast paced, level design isn't amazing but at least you don't have unavoidable shit. Yeh it's absolutely mad how many games come out for iOS now.  So much stuff flying under the radar.  PC games will be like that soon enough. O.o [Parallax](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/d/d8/Parallax.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141017093607) >I am lost too. But I guess it's the layers of background moving at different speeds as you go through the level. 

That's exactly it!  I agree.  I do try to post gameplay, but I can really only go off trailers at the moment (usually the games aren't out when I first post about them).  Often times the trailer doesn't really represent what the game is like unfortunately.  :(

 This is why I dropped money on black desert even though I don't really play much at all anymore. I watched a bunch of random YouTubers play it and liked the action part, watching their videos one would think it's a waifu sim... Yep that's part of the reason why the site is designed for quick visual info.  Also it's not reliant on ads (and probably won't ever be) so I don't care if you follow on Tumblr/Instagram and never visit.

Once people are sharing I'm happy. No problem, thanks for the feedback. :) early-access isn't really a system, more of a label game devs or publishers put on their unfinished, but playable game. It's like a more modern word for an open beta. the game that pretty much started this trend was, as per usual as far as indie trendsetters go, Minecraft. Greenlight is basically a game-concept voting contest afaik. It isn't that great, since many greenlit titles are never finished when some polished gems don't ever reach the light of day. True, but I rarely see games go to greenlight, then release the same month.
 Haha that last one was great.  Eastshade is a walking sim, Totem is an adventure game in a glitchy world.   

Your others were spot on though.  Especially Yono (dev takes a lot of inspiration from Minish Cap). Their art style is amazing.  If you're interested follow @grinningpickle (the devs) on twitter.  They tweet a lot of their art experimentations, it's great.  [Website is here.](http://www.totemteller.com/) Thanks, I need all the luck. :P Yeh sorry about that.  It does cut out some users due to performance (and internet actually).  I spent a lot of time thinking about it, but ended up going with the autoloading gifs as having to click on stuff is a pain and I wanted the site to just be moving as you landed.  My inbox is a bit swamped at the moment so I can't go into all the detail of the stuff I tried, post counts, infinite scrolling, lazy loading etc. etc.

I still think about a better way to do it, but every option makes it inconvenient for another set of users.  Web design is tough. >.<

Thanks a lot for the feedback, sorry about the performance stuff.  I'll keep thinking about it. Something something gorilla man Don't let that Keep you from trying. Yeah, generalizing is not the way to go. But sure, his comments can be applied to many things (I am not getting exited by most AAA trailers either because most of them just show of flashy action and graphics..).


I just feel that many people (at least me) have a higher bar for indie titles because they often actually bring something fresh and new to the scene and it's kinda disappointing when they don't. Meanwhile we (I) all know that AAA titles (in most cases) just rerelease/paint over old concepts. (Wether or not this is fair; I don't think so, but it kinda is something I can't disable) >Next year maybe, but probably not any time soon.

T-T You are wrong.... this is the mean thing you said  > Yer a wizard! Will this make you believe me? (435 Gold)

I love when they let you shove gold at people to convince them of stupid shit. 

I remember the quest for Molag Bal's mace was a prime example of this. You need to rescue a enemy priest so Molag can torture kill and enslave his spirit. You rescue the priest and the priest is obviously skeptical as to why someone would show up and save them. Instead of following their suspicion that hey, this guy is trying to fucking kill me and sell my soul to a demon, I'll take a few hundred gold and just accept this. What? Stuff that smug little bastard in a Soul Gem and make my own damn prophecy.

Fuck it, take my money. Neville would just take over the prophecy
 Now I NEED a Harry Potter's Creed game Ezio Potter confirmed I shouldn't have done that. I should NOT have done that.  The difference between you and me is that i NEVER go back to the carpet store. /r/unexpectedrickandmorty Came here to post this, you beat me to it. Take your upvote.  That's enough game developing for you Satan Hagrid isn't able to ride his griffin, thus Draco kills Dombledoor. Voldemort quick scopes Harry, then Harry uses his soul to revive the griffin.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Oh god, my best/worst memory of Don't Starve Together involves two friends and I.  One of the friends hadn't played before and we were trying to teach him the basics.  We started off in foraging mode, as was our strategy for the first few days.  My friends went off in one direction while I explored the other.

Wasn't long before I thought I hit the jackpot.  In the middle of a random patch was a fridge!  A fridge this early would be amazing!  Regardless of what was inside, I could hammer it down for a lot of rare materials to give us a big boost.  But there was also a chest nearby, so I opened it.

WHAM

Immediate winter starts.  My friend on the other side of the world shouts "What the fuck!" and I'm sheepishly forced to admit it was my fault.  We all froze to death.  Still laugh about it to this day. it feels like a circular stage imo
 
like he's running around in circles

no escape

no hope See, that's how I go through life. I don't know shit, but somehow always figure things out. A day will come when my wits won't be enough. minecraft was never in early-access. it's not on steam. it was sold as an alpha-product, then a beta-product, then in full release.

did it really set the trend for early-access on steam? does e.a. exist outside of steam? No problem, I don't have that much of a problem with it. As I said, it was only because I had a fullscreen 1080p YT vid running, when I turned it off and went back to your site, I noticed no lag whatsoever. But maybe some people with less powerful PCs and/or internet connection will notice it.

I'm a software developer and I also do a little web design for our software, so I know it can be a pain in the ass (although you most likely have more experience than I do).
How about a compromise? Load one gif per article and make the other static images until you click them. Maybe this will help performance wise.

Kudos to you that you're designing the website by yourself and also filling it with content. I'm sure that's a time consuming job. All true, but I'd say this game isn't really run of the mill (to me anyway).  The only thing like it (recently) is Kingdom, which has a different play style entirely.  So while the actual game play of combat has been done, and the survival aspects have been done in other games, it's really not your standard "pixel art side scroller".

It's taken a lot of things that have been done before and mashed them into something else that really hasn't.  I understand if that's not enough to pique your interest, I just take issue with writing it off as "standard".

I realise this isn't what you were saying, just expanding on what I meant.

 http://i.imgur.com/VL05sbm.gifv This was precisely the quest I was thinking of. He immediately called my bluff on the lie (called to action by his diety) which, frankly didn't seem that unrealistic to me. 

Instead he's like "*nope nobody could know, please get fucked*" and so we have the options of

Let me free you

*or*

Leave you bound like a pig on a mountain with all the people I just killed after you just told me *not even your god knows where to find you*

Instead I paid money to *allow me to free him*

I'm so mad I couldn't leave him and go back to Molag Bal like "yeah, he died. Do you have someone else we can use" Do it following James and the gang as they get up to mischief. A Salazar's Creed Are you sure there's any 'magic weed' left after you finished with it? What, that can happen in Don't Starve? Just opening a chest turns it into immediate winter? I had a fun DST game once. Was playing on a public server, 10 strangers and we were all cooperating so well, working together on one big base. Well, all of the sudden we notice all of the gold has been taken from our chests, and no one is admitting that they were the one to take it. People start getting angry, accusing each other, and before you know it all the trust it gone, people are hoarding their items and have taken everything out of the chests. A few of the 10 remain at the base, but at this point I’ve long since grabbed what I could and ran out to survive on my own. 

As tensions are rising, and people begin dying left and right, I begin to rally some of the others into believing the person playing the Librarian is the one who stole all of the gold. They won’t admit it, they won’t deny it, which causes the group to grow even more angry.

At this point I know I need that gold to survive, so I grab the only leverage I can- the Librarian had stored some of their things in chester, which I immediately grab and steal for myself.

“So, you don’t have the gold, huh? That’s a shame.  I’d also be a shame if something happened to all of these stacks of grass and twigs”

“No….please. Please don’t do it” the Librarian begins to beg. “I don’t have the gold, I swear”, the Librarian finally admits they don’t have the gold, but at this point it is too late.


“Hm,” I equip a lit torch, and throw the twigs/grass piles on the ground. “A reaaaaaal shame then” By the time I enter the message, the materials are already lit aflame, half an hour of the LIbrarian’s gathering has just been turned to ash. 

“Nooooooooooooooooo” is all the Librarian can manage to let out. It is winter by now, and without the needed materials to make a fire/keep warm, she is dead by the end of the night.

Having been waiting nearby, I quickly run in to loot her corpse. But among the many things...there is no gold. No gold? No gold?! Did she leave it somewhere? She HAD to be the one with the gold, pretty much everyone else was dead at this point!

I wandered around, panicked. 8 of the 10 players were dead at this point (the only other survivor abandoned ship after the missing gold episode like I did), and as you recall dead players drain the sanity of living ones, so I NEEDED that gold to live. In one last ditch effort, I run back to the original camp where everything had started…

And see one more corpse was there than before. Some random player, quiet, who had never really said a word all game. Dead, under a pocket lighter, a half used spear, and a pile of gold ore that was so big you could barely see the skeleton under it.

I actually added the Librarian after that game. They admitted later they didn’t fess up about not having the gold early on because they were loving all the drama that was ensuing.  My favorite moment of that game was when I was playing with a friend, cutting trees down and the big ass tree spawns. 

I panic, don't have weapons wtf do I do. So beeing a smartass I tried to jokingly plant trees so he could be my friend. Turns out that worked. One of my favorit gaming moments by far. Lol holy shit yeah, sounds like my first playthrough. Except I didn't have to open any chest, I just froze to death in my stupidity. Eventually I'll get the game for the PS4 for me and my gf, whenever she's done with the new Pokémon xD Well I'm not still designing it haha, getting it to work right was so stressful!  Still things that I need to clean up but I keep putting it off.  I'm more info game development than web.

I'll keep that idea in mind though, this has been really good for feedback as I don't usually get people talking about problems (those users just leave).  So thanks for that! That kid sure does like his dinner. How they mercilessly outnumber Snape and bully him 😂😂 But we already know how that story arc ends.. that's what the magic is for, duh It's a specific random trap that can spawn.  Looks like a little patch of snow with a fridge, a chest, and a thermometer.  Opening the chest causes Winter to start, or resets it to Day 1 of Winter if you're already in that season.

It's hilarious if you aren't expecting it.  We still start games of Don't Starve Together with "Remember, if you see a fridge and a chest, DO NOT OPEN IT." You injected a game of Werewolf into your Don't Starve Together server.  I love it.

Was half expecting the story to end "IT WAS ME!  I TOOK THE GOLD!" It's called Pokémon Sun or Moon. Pokémon XD was on Gamecube. No problem, I know it's hard. And when you get feedback, often it's something that makes you think "Dude, really? This is a problem for you? Are you serious right now?". It's hard to evaluate what really is a problem with your software or if it's just one or two isolated cases of personal preference.

General rule of thumb for me is 1) if you had doubts about a feature/thing yourself and 2) if not one or two but a few people are pointing out something, it's worth looking into and considering changing it - even if you think it's not the way you'd want it to work. It's not the destination but the journey. What about the fridge itself? Can you salvage it or does that set off the trap too? 

I'm afraid to go near the Don't Starve Wiki because it always sucks me in for hours at a time... Haha, that's just devious. I remember being decently well prepared for my winter and still almost running out of food and freezing to death when I ventured away for it. Then I tried setting a treeguard on fire and was one-shotted even with log armour :( The funnies part is that fits so well with your username xD  It would have better if the librarian said, "you were expecting gold, but it was me, DIO!!"  I know what you did there, but Pokémon XD was a really badass game. My jackass friend stole my Lv 100 Blaziken from Ruby and put it on his copy of the game though  Hehe hitting the nail on the head.  Praise be to anyone who does this full time. exactly so dont give me the option to exit the animus! Touché. It would be interesting to see their story and how they fought He Who Shall Not Be Named back before Harry's time. You can salvage the fridge no problem, which is good because you can get an easy Gear out of it for building one in your base. I've never survived Winter because my friend always attacks the penguins.  Came really close, but nope.  He had to go hit the penguins. Roundabout starts to play. you'll never get 100% of the juice like that That is one sexy lemon party. Is the new one good? I love the original and the 1000 year door but the last one sucked.  Better weaponized lemons haven't been seen since Megaman. Is it just me or is that the same lemon model they used in Pikmin 3? They're [cutting the lemon all wrong.](http://imgur.com/0bCG3) Get your shit together Nintendo.  The sticker star sequel that no one wanted. Oh boy Is this another sticker star? Wasn't the first one kinda bad? Why don't they go back to the original Paper Mario? The first one were so amazing! All I want is a true sequel to Super Mario RPG. I need more Geno and Mallow in my life. I will forever covet that game.  But how does a horizontal cutting animation result in a vertically cut lemon?  Pikmin 3, is that you? **AWWWWWW HAMMER BROS AND SPIKES! DON'T YOU *DARE* BE SOUR!** Did I just watch an acid attack? Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door GOAT Is there an uncanny valley for fruit? Is that a thing?

I think that should be a thing. I want to go back to the first paper Mario rpg style not this sticker crap As much as I hate that they're keeping Sticker Star's stupid combat system, this game does look GORGEOUS. Thousand Year Door is the only Paper Mario I ever need. They have a winning formula from thousand year door that they ruin with "innovation" stupid nintendo "really realistic"

No actual honest-to-god kitchen is this immaculate  I hope the NX plays WiiU games in some way, because there are a few WiiU games I want to play - but not enough to buy the system at this stage of its life. Lemon juice bukakke? Sniffet: The goggles THEY DO NOTHING! Is this a real game? Looks beautiful When life gives you lemons, use it to marinate turtle meat. [Then you probably haven't seen the piggy bank.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij0ZaHgFSg) NSFW. Those lemon squeezing whores! [deleted] What the fuck is going on here  THERES A NEW PAPER MARIO!?!? 

Man, I loved the N64 one and the thousand year door! For a full clip, check out lemonparty.org question...if they are supposed to be paper, wouldn't liquid just...i don't know melt them? RIP Paper Mario This is too depressing to watch... all that awesome graphics without the soul of the thousand year door What is this, Gumball? That shy guy's probably feeling really lucky that he got that mask on. When Nintendo gives you lemons make the Princess happy They should have used the new method for slicing lemons to get more juice. Enough to finish off the two hammer brothers, in this instance. THERE'S A NEW PAPER MARIO!! How did I not know this!!! NEW PAPER MARIO??? Holy shit!! One of my favorite games ever is coming back. EVERY
VILLAIN
IS
LEMONS

EVVVILLLLL!!  Not a huge fan of the combat by the looks but I love the art style and the graphics with every ounce of my being even more so than 1000 year door. Mario is trying to squeeze one out. I read this"... Lemon and kitten... " watched the gif 4 times to spot the kitten..  Shit got real I wonder what they're reason is for putting this on NX and not just saying "fuck it, it'll be a NX launch exclusive"

Edit: also holy fuck the fact that this is running on a Wii U is amazing, it really shows what that console can do when games are stylized correctly and worked hard on.  To anyone who thinks that the gif doesn't really show that great of detail, I'd suggest to watching the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9XQ9IXOkd4#t=116s) (1080p for best demonstration of detail) for a better look. There's a new Paper Mario? Fuck _yes_. [Have you seen the triphop dubstep dancing pig video?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij0ZaHgFSg)
 When will Nintendo realize that they can do a Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars-esque sequel and make millions on it? Jesus this just made me want lemonade Wow now I really want the new Paper Mario! Nintendo loves rendering fruits.

See: Pikmin 3 You know something is wrong when lemons in video games look better than you do... This actually just made me get this game  Every
Villain 
Is
Lemons
🍋🍋🍋 'Fatality' I think this is just two videos being played on either side.  No engine can load that that fast, and having it always loaded would be a horrible waste of resources.  The kitchen also never goes in front of the guys and the lemon never goes behind.

Still really cool tho. Best graphics Nintendo ever had in a game, secured safely in the background  paper mario for n64 is a classic I love lemon parties  /r/nintendocirclejerk is leaking apparently  Can't say I enjoy that they're doing combat similar to Sticker Star again but I suppose it wasn't that bad. Grinding items because you realized you were low right before a boss fight was just really annoying.

It is a card deck, though, so maybe you don't actually use them up but just use the paint on them before shuffling them back into the deck. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSJ1--kBZ4 more lemons to catch you by surprise color splash looks real fun honestly I think it says a lot when good graphics take Nintendo fans by surprise **"If it's not like Thousand-Year Door, it sucks."** ~ 80% of the fanbase Too bad they didn't use all that effort to make a good game. Yay now instead of strategically timing my attacks with action commands I can watch a glorified 15 second long cutscene. At least the lemons are realistic looking! Fuck this game Damn that's evil. "Realistic"?? Lemons can't fly! Very beautiful That's quite the summon. I'm so meta, even this acronym Searched for your comment. Was expecting more updates for you. You can have mine So meta I understand this reference  I don't see old Dick anywhere! I can't believe I just got tricked into watching a lemon party. I guess I should be on the lookout for tubgirl or goatse or something next. When life give you lemons... not like this A Liz Lemon party aint like no other party cuz a Liz Lemon party is mandatory.  [Great job!](http://www.chud.com/articles/content_images/47/TimandEricSeason2/TimEric7.jpg) Lemon party? It looks like they're doing combat similar to Sticker Star (you have cards to use instead of stickers.)


That said it looks like they're doing away with the Level Select world and bringing back the more open world feel of the older games.


I have mixed feelings but overall it looks good.


[Here's the trailer, the game comes out on Oct 7th.](https://youtu.be/7ZyerryUkoc) What about *Super Paper Mario*? It was a bit different, but it still was good. No one can actually answer this because the game in this GIF (Paper Mario: Color Splash) isn't out yet.

Many people are skeptical of this one for fear that Nintendo hasn't learned anything from the widespread rejection of Paper Mario: Sticker Star, but until it's out no one can know for sure. I don't understand why they can't just make us another actual Paper Mario game. I don't give a fuck about innovation if the formula already makes gold. No. What made 1000 year door is it was an RPG. Every other Paper Mario after it is a joke because they went away from that. If you played any of the first 3 DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT play Sticker Star or color splash to be similar. Sticker Star is not terrible, but when compared to the other 3 it will make you cry. I liked what they did with it as a platformer but it wasn't a true RPG AT ALL. No love for super? You guys make me sad :( Although I really love the first 2,i came back to sticker star after being so opposed to it, and you know what? I ended loving it. I can see why Nintendo See's the need to tinker with it now and again. 

That being said I wish Nintendo would throw us a bone every now and then and bring back classic every couple of games, but I also see why they won't do that either.  i will continue to play thousand year door for the rest of my pitiful life and i thought the one for wii was different but not horrible Cave Johnson would like a word. YEAH! YEAH!! LEEMONS!!!

Edit: Here's the reference for those out of the loop https://youtu.be/8FpigqfcvlM?t=514 Looks like the same asset but at least they went through the effort to slice it and animate it being squeezed. I dunno man, I'm no citrusologist, but lemons tend to look pretty similar across the board. I'm a little confused with how you would squeeze the middle part of the lime? I want to believe.  That's for limes, not lemons. Meta  How does this work? Are you just supposed to squeeze all the lime pieces?
 All the fans want is the return of the simple but elegant RPG system of the first two games that was accessible, deep and didn't require the kind of grinding that people had to do in other RPGs.

I really hope they can return to that someday. Plus tossing out character variety and only giving us different Toads is a bit of a step backwards. So long as the cards are permanent and you don't have to go collecting them every time you use them then I'll be okay. Sticker Star was tedious because of that. Here are the problems I had with the first one:

1. There were little to no secrets. You were forced to solve hard, sometimes downright ridiculous puzzles with almost no hints as part of the regular story. The replayability was very low. A good video game isn't easy nor hard, but hits the balance, and has many secrets which give you a reason to go back and explore. 

2. The sticker system forced you to collect stickers after their uses. This was frustrating, because you were forced to grind for stickers. Most of the time the stickers you found weren't even good ones. Going through the same levels over and over again is just as frustrating. For the new one, they should make it similar to deck building. I remember with the GBA Megaman Battle NEtwork games, you had to build your deck by collecting battle chips. The more work you put in searching and battling, the better you got. This system would work perfectly with the one set up already in the new PM. 

3. The thing cards and bosses. You were forced to use overpowered cards to defeat a boss in pretty much one hit. It took away from the strategy of the fights, the intense battles, and forced you to fight over and over before you finally got a hint of how you beat the bosses. Thing cards should not be used in battle. They should exist solely outside of battle and be used to solve puzzles, similar to how paper transformations were in PMTYD. 

4. Lastly, it was just the plain tediousness of the game that made it bad. It was less a game and more of a grinding struggle with very minor rewards. A good video game should be engaging, offering a solid story together with engaging characters. It should offer a system that rewards hard work, but a game that can still be completed without it. Overall, a video game should be one that should allow many different types of people to play the game how they want. It shouldn't be a game where they have to do what the developers want them to do. 
  I wish Intelligent Systems would make a new Advance Wars instead, but that series doesn't have enough waifu to defeat Fire Emblem. That's basically Nintendo's m.o. at the moment, unfortunately. 

New sticker star, Metroid Federation Force, Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival... From what i've read, Nintendo doesn't want to have two different RPG series, which would be the "Paper Mario" series and the "Mario & Luigi" series.  So, they've decided to keep "Mario & Luigi" as their Mario RPG series and turn Paper Mario into an experimental franchise, to the dismay of many Paper Mario fans (including myself). Don't take people'S opinions about it here, go research the game to avoid negative bias. Everyone here is going to hate it because it isn't TTYD 2. Apparently they're doing away with the level select at the very least. I haven't played that game in years, but it's one of the few soundtracks that I can just start playing in my head anytime. Too bad those characters are owned by square  Nintendo needs to hook up with square enix again. Have you ever tried Super Mario RPG Revolution?
http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/611/ 

It a Rom hack that makes the game a bit harder and more balanced. Adds a ton of replay value to a new play-through if you haven't tried it yet. The closest thing is the Mario and Luigi series on ds and gba.  They are very well done. CLAP FOR YOUR WORLD FAMOUS MARIO AND  **FEEEEEEELLLLL** THE POWER!!!! SquaredCircle is leaking again.  My favorite game ever What did you name your Yoshi?

Gotta be **"Broshi"**. Allegedly the creator of the Paper Mario series refused the additions of new characters and partners after SPM. Yeah you get a new guy here and there but they're no Goombella or Crump or Don Pianta. So they chose to kill their games by streamlining the casting process.

 I mean Sticker Star was godawful for more reasons but that was a big part. uncanny orchard It exists for anything that you understand intrinsically - if it doesn't look quite right, but you can't tell why, that's the uncanny valley striking. The Mario & Luigi saga on the handhelds have been exceptional. The first one is the best, it's on GBA and is what I feel the closest there's been to any Mario RPG successor. They strayed away from what made the first one so good with their weird gimmicks in the later games but the RPG elements and combat stay super tight and really good. The first is great as well (and I must say the third... while different is was quite enjoyable). Although Thousand Year Door is just too good. I might actually get the new console if they release two more Paper Mario's in the same style as the original and the Thousand Year Door.  Man, the things I would do for that. How does Nintendo manage to simultaneously be the best and worst gaming company? Shigeru Miyamoto thought Sticker Star looked too much like The Thousand-Year Door so he had them scrap basically everything. Hence Sticker Star.


Super Mario Galaxy 2 was also supposed to have more story (and hinted at Rosalina being related to at least one of the main characters), but he thought story would take away from platforming so that was dropped too.  they actually used that winning formula on the other identically controlled and played series mario and luigi rpg series

but ya know they TOTTALLY should keep 2 identical franchises running For some reason I had to read that sentence like, 15 times to understand what you meant...

... but I totally agree. Maybe Digitally on NX Maybe once the NX drops the wii u will finally drop in price and stop being inexplicably the most expensive console with the least power and offerings. That would mean the NX would need a handheld tv/controller monstrosity again. Do you want that? it is These are "special" attacks and don't come up often, you have to collect them in the overworld and can only use them a few times I loved the Final Fantasy summons back in the day, but they started to get retarded in length (Knights of the Round Table in FF7 comes to mind) and just took the momentum out of the fights, even though they are turn based with some time elements thrown in.  Yeah but it hardly resembles those two anymore. The series took an unfortunate direction after those games. The N64 one and Thousand Year Door are the only two that function that way. The other games are just set in the Paper Mario universe and they aren't as good. Lemon juice does not melt paper. No. Gumball is cancelled... :'( You do know there's been 3 more after the original right? Don't get too excited. It's a sequel to Sticker Star. Well, yeah.

Thousand Year Door is easily one of the best games on the Gamecube. Sticker Star was rubbish, yet it's the one they're going to model this game after. It's better if you use double Enters. That way you can read down.

😍😍 You cant have a lemon party without Old Dick! What happened to you? This isn't you. I want the Old Dick back. I want Good Old Dick. Not Bad New Dick. Give me the Dick Im used to. Give me the Dick I love. TITO DICK DICKMAN BABY Literally unplayable. Ah, the good ol' days.  I, too, am from the early internet. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) The Holy Trinity Make explosive lemons and pay a visit to see life's manager? Watch out for lemons stealing whores. https://youtu.be/3rnFlQAvk8U "Ain't no party like a Liz Lemon party 'cause a Liz Lemon party is MANDATORY."

FTFY There ain't no party like a Leslie Knope party, 'cause a Leslie Knope party is actually 30 parties. Just google it if you're confused. There's a website dedicated to the topic that explains it pretty clearly.  They hired the worst possible narrator for that trailer. Hmm after watching this whole video you linked, Color Splash seems way more intriguing. I get that it's a far cry from Paper Mario and TTYD, but even if it's different battle mechanics and such it still looked interesting, at least...

The visuals and aesthetic look solid for sure. The only weird thing is the lighting looked way off. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it just seemed like all of the foreground characters and items and stuff were way more shadowed than they should be.  no more party characters or funny villains? count me out This reminds me of Rick and Morty in that it sounds like the narrator was improvising and they animated whatever he said afterwards Damn... that actually looks pretty sweet The Level Select is still there but I think it's more of a way to fast travel. It does appear that these areas aren't individual stages like in Sticker Star. Uggghh when will they realize that the allies were the heart and soul of the original Paper Mario games?  The game looks pretty innovative despite the weird sticker combat, but having a group of allies with unique strengths and cool backstories adds so much to the game.

Mario is a boring protagonist with only a handful of moves, but throw in Flurrie or Bobbery and suddenly the puzzles are a lot more diverse and the story is a lot more interesting. So the game is like a reverse Super Mario Sunshine? Why do they feel the need to put real life objects in the game? It just looks so out of place and breaks the "paper" feel...If I really want to see real life stuff I'll just look away from the screen. Super Paper Mario is good because it's a totally different genre and a good game in its own right.

Sticker Star sucks because it's the same genre, but it strips everything that made the game fun.
 It would have been received better had it not had *Paper mario* in the name. I absolutely loved Super Paper Mario. I haven't played any of the others but I'll check this one out.  I've only ever played Super and I loved it, I was only like 12 at the time so for all I know it's not that fun or whatever. But I didn't have any Paper Mario style game expectations to bog down my opinion. I really loved that game, damn onions got me near the end tho. Super Paper Mario was alright, but it became repetitive and tedious quickly. I very much enjoyed it as something different. I'd love to see a sequel to that, especially compared to Sticker Star. It was alright, but very far below the first two games. I loved Super Paper Mario. It was worse than the first two (TYD is one of the greatest games of all time) but I still really loved it. I like games that combine RPG elements with other genres, so I love me an RPG platformer. I think the biggest thing for me is them removing partners. Super kinda had them with the Pixels but with the game style and multiple characters it made sense. Now that it's back to a Turn based system I really wish they were in the game. Nothing is better then slapping people with Lady Bow or sneaking around with Vivian  Most if not all of the gameplay elements that made Sticker Star the game it was are present in Color Splash. Attacks limited to items, no meaningful leveling system, boss fights are puzzles instead of tough battles, no partners, NPCs are nearly all identical toads and every enemy is an enemy from a past Mario game, etc. 

Anyone holding out hope that Color Splash won't be Sticker Star 2 is going to be disappointed at launch. from everyone who has had their hands on the game at pax/e3.... it actually apaprently plays well

also it has MULTIPLE disco boo encoutners

thats a win on its own Yep, they're never going back to that. I paid 40 dollars for another copy of thousand year door just so I could play it again on my wii. Is paper Mario the spiritual successor to Super Mario RPG? Thats not entirely true. I agree that ditching the rpg system gets rid of any thinking or replay value that the game has. I'd also say i probably wouldnt even pick the game up if there were no meaningful leveling/strengthening system. Thats not what makes the game, or any game, great though.

TTYD was great because of storytelling and environment. Thats the major difference between TTYD and the original Paper Mario. In PM, each world resembled some standard Mario environment, just paper. In TTYD, your homeworld is a crime ridden, dingy town with a big sewer system. It was dark, but not depressing, and all the writing was witty and charming. It gave the game *depth*. Even in petal meadows, the most "standard" Mario level of the game, Hooktail literally swallows half your audience half way through the fight, to which your partner responds "thats just messed up". You deal with mobsters and identity theft amongst other things, but its never quite too much for a little kid to handle. The story just felt so interesting and real, and so *not* the usual brainless mario formula.


Remember Glitzville? Replay it a few times and its not that interesting of a level, but my first time through it was fucking AWESOME because you legitimately felt like you were an underdog climbing the ranks.

Thats what made TTYD great. Sorry for the wall of text. Was sorta reliving the game there on my busride to work. Super is amazing even though it's not turn based.  Color Splash is not the same. I can respect your opinion on Sticker Star but Color Splash is not really even close to the same game as that monstrosity. Super Paper Mario was great, but I don't think the story and characters were as good as Thousand Year Door.  But it's also such a different game that it's hard to consider them part of the same series. Super was a different breed of game. A lemon grenade, a lemonade.  And splashing the screen!

 This is my argument for many claims of the same sort.

One person goes "they stole the deer model from game X or they just downloaded freeware models how cheap!!"

There is not many different ways you can make an animal or object so saving time and money is smart. jr. pomelologist here. can confirm. they look similar.. https://youtu.be/d6_p2e8LEP0?t=66

Found a video. Pretty cool. > I'm a little confused with how you would squeeze the middle part of the lime **without getting juice all over your fucking hands**?

That's the tricky part. That picture was on some front page yesterday. Someone posted a video in the thread where a guy twisted it. Seemed to work quite well. You twist it. Yea I mean seriously op get your memes right #They're the same thing! 

^/s squeeze the side slices, twist the middle one. It's almost impressive how much the Paper Mario games have changed for the worse. Sadly, I doubt the Paper Mario series will return to its roots.  From what i've read, Nintendo doesn't want to have two different RPG series, which would be the Paper Mario series and the Mario & Luigi series. So, they've decided to keep Mario & Luigi as their Mario RPG series and turn Paper Mario into an experimental franchise, to the dismay of many Paper Mario fans (including myself). The reason for that is that the director think paper mario is only good for paper-based mechanics since mario and luigi are already doing RPGs. even though M&L is also becoming less and less original. Super Paper Mario was an awesome game. Different =/= bad. Haven't played the later ones though so I can't speak for them. Here's one thing I don't get: Why does it *have* to be Paper Mario? If Nintendo wants the Paper Mario series to go this way, then so be it. What you should be asking for is the same type of game, like you just described. Then maybe Nintendo will be able to release a new series that is entirely focused on it, create a new spinoff, or something of that nature. It lets Nintendo know *exactly* what you want, not just "the old Paper Mario" like I see a lot of fans saying. However, the biggest reason for focusing on wanting the core concepts of the first two games is this: Third Parties. If people see a demand, they'll fill it. Just look at games like Yooka-Laylee and Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.

Basically, the game you want can be made if you concentrate your focus on asking for a game *like* the first two Paper Marios. Just open your horizons and realize what you want isn't limited to one franchise, and companies might take notice and pander a bit. Deck building would have made the game a lot better. So I'm hoping that deck building is in this game in some way.

My biggest problem is the Thing cards like pictured in the GIF. You still need Thing Cards to beat a boss, it seems like, and they're pretty much 1 hit KOs.  I'm sorry and I don't mean to be a bearer of bad news, but I think that the cards are one-and-done, just like last time. I was hoping it would have that permanent deck-building too, but c'est la vie. Who knows, maybe they will have special kinds of cards that won't disappear as hidden unlockables, but that seems like a false hope. Don't forget that there was no reason at all to fight the standard enemies. There was no xp, so they only dropped coins when defeated, and the amount of coins you got for winning were sometimes lower than the cost of the stickers used to win the battle. To the detriment of both series. It makes sense but as someone that has beaten Paper Mario one 5 times, Paper Mario TTYD 10+ times, and Super at least 3 times I am really depressed.  They need to make Mario and Luigi actually look good in the new RPGs. In Dream Team and Sticker Star Mario and Luigi look so ugly That and the dev team for the Paper Mario series is mostly new people. When they showed off a Paper Mario game they were working on for the 3DS, Miyamoto told them to stop because it was too much like a "Thousand Year Door clone." So he told them to do something new. He was also the one who told them to not make new characters and just use generic Toads. I kind of feel bad for the developers because they make an original game of their own and everyone says it's not as good as the games the team before them made. Honestly, if Sticker Star and Color Splash were a separate series, we would have no problems. But for some reason Nintendo decided that this is Paper Mario now.

Miyamoto is a great guy and all, but lately I think he should just stick to hardware. Some of his recent game development decisions have generally been steps in the wrong direction. I hated Mario & Luigi so much. I can't even remember why now but I know I thought it was terrible. Paper Mario was great. [Someone made a really good video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=gR11d5I-5RQ) that talked about this, thought I'd link it. This seriously needs to be communicated to Nintendo more.  Belome was such a fun boss, the Yoshi races with the cookies, the mine cart portions. Seriously one of my favorite games ever.  I'll just set [this](https://youtu.be/Sh0X-8S81ro) here.  I've literally been humming [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFnwioqAbks&t=18m12s) the whole time while reading this thread So that just means that either A) Nintendo needs to get the rights for a new game or 

B) Nintendo needs to team up with Square Enix to make a new Mario rpg. Given their willingness to open up to devs lately and how well the first one went over and how well Square does with RPGs in general it seems like a pretty great idea to me. They're not even close to Seven Stars. IT'S A MARIO YES IT IS Don't be booty.  Man I love that game. Every year I seem to go back and play it... Zelda convinced me that I need the NX, but man, of a new Paper Mario like TYD comes...

I would only cry the lack of Metroid. I wholeheartedly disagree. 

Arlo's video explains it perfectly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR11d5I-5RQ Not to mention if they keep making Paper Mario in the 1000 year door style after 3 games of it everyone will be complaining that all Nintendo does is play it safe and make the same game over and over. they can't win Wrong. They are very different. M&L is much shallower and Paper Mario has partners that provide deeper gameplay and they all have so much personality. The tablet is the least of the Wii U's problems. If that's what is required for it to be backwards compatible, yes. I didn't mind the gamepad anyway
 I think the length is okay if it's worth it, or if it's so powerful that the length acts as a deterrent. It made me only want to summon Bahamut Zero when I *really* wanted to. I enjoyed quite a lot the Wii one. It was pretty good. Haven't played the DS one though and Iv'e heard that they got mixed response from the public Steel beams tho...

Why do the lemons want whores that bad? Fuck. I butchered it That is some comically bad narration there. "Be careful mario... woah! That doesn't look good" I thought narrators talking to the characters had gone away. It could have had no narration at all to be honest. Right, its like the grab the lastperson who was stuck at the office that day. Even worse than that Mighty No 9 prom night guy? It almost sounds like somebody reading a story out loud for their kids  I don't know, it sounds like they were going for a child's story book feel. It sounds like a dad telling  the story to his kid.  [Nintendo doesn't know how to commercial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-qBkWerZDg) and just had him record the lines on his phone. It's a Nintendo Treehouse presenter. I'm sure he loves all the comments about how he's a bad narrator. wow that guy was like the PM commentater that said LUUUIWWWWEEGEEEEE Sounds like Dane Cook. The production quality on that voiceover is just awful all around. It feels like they had an issue with getting it done professionally (not done on time? contractor took the money and ran?) so whoever contracted the video just plugged in his kid's prosumer podcast set-up and did it himself. No kidding wtf sounds like some YouTuber did it The worst? That's a stretch.

Pretty sure it's Al Roker though. I think Nintendo is convinced that their customer base consists entirely of 8-year-olds. the lighting oddness is intentional as far as i know, I just wondering if there's any Mario RPG DNA left in the game. I think they're coming closer and closer to real paper Honestly, I was getting the same feeling. I wanted to hate it because I'm a big fan of the first three PM's (I've never played SS because I've heard nothing but terrible things) but it looks like it has some really interesting mechanics. The combat doesn't look *great* but it could still be fun. Looks pretty sour to me They need to make another Thousand Year Door style game. The RPG elements were fun and the story was really cool. The biggest problem with Sticker Star to me was the story. The Paper Mario series to me is the spiritual successor to Super Mario RPG, which was the first game to have a threat bigger than Bowser. The first Paper Mario did a good job of having Bowser take Peach and everything without feeling repetitious, and then TTYD blew it out of the water by making an entire new world of unique characters and compelling story. Super Paper Mario did the same and had good characters too, but then Sticker Star was just back to business with Bowser abducting Peach and none of the bosses and real personality or were memorable like previous games(Super Koopa Bros, Tubba Blubba, Doopliss, Sir Grodus, Koopa Jr,  Dimentio, Count Bleck, all stick out, I remember the Pokey with a crown on it and Bowser Jr with Sticker Star?) and just reminded me of everything I'd see in like New Super Mario Bros only in the PM style.  This! SPM worked because it wasn't trying to be the first two.

Sticker Star tried to be the original but didn't try to be *good* at it. I can't wait to play some *Super*! Which is dumb since it was still Paper Mairo. It was a spinoff...to a spinoff. You definitely need to try the thousand year door then. One of the best games of the game cube. Highly recommend Thousand Year Door, if you can find it somehow.

Havnig played the three, Super Paper Mario, while not bad perse, was very much a step down from TYD.

The lack of an open world made things way less interesting and made you detached.  
Like, how there's one world in SPM that gets wiped out. Did I care? Not really.  
Had that happened to a part of the world in TYD, damn. It's only crime was not being the game people actually wanted. When you think of "Paper Mario", you think of an RPG, not a platformer. It was a good game, but it was very jarring playing it as a fan of the first two Paper Mario games. It still had the the humour, the writing, the Paper Mario charm, but it was more of a platformer than a turn-based RPG like the first two were. That's why I wished it wasn't a Paper Mario game; it would have been a very good game on it's own if it had been a new standalone non-Mario title or a different, new Mario series. It's story was the best though Yeah the lack of partners is terrible. You can't have a good RPG without meaningful characters. Without buddies, what characters are you supposed to actually kind of like?

 I was just gonna comment this, I felt like partners were what made the game awesome. I remember how riveting it was in Thousand Year Door trying to guess who my next partner was in the next area. Along with the story development with the characters. So amazing Disco boos you say? SIGN ME UP.  Yep.  Yeah, it was a very different game, but I really enjoyed it. It's not even out yet how you could you know.  I liked Super's story the most actually. It's got a much darker tone than the others, akin to Majora's Mask when compared to Ocarina of Time.

The other Paper Mario games are just the same old villain motivated by getting power, but most of SPM featured a villain motivated by the despair of losing someone.

The settings are more interesting, too. The protagonists in TTYD go as far as space and an ancient shadow temple, but in SPM they literally go through alternate dimensions, oblivion and hell. That's my fetish!!!! On the other hand game companies rack up assets that they can reuse as many times as they want. Saves time and money. Work for a company like nintendo and you probably get access to terabytes of assets and textures. dude just get one of those 50c lime squeezer thingies from the dollar store. simple as fuck, and even if you don't get quite as much juice out of the lime, *who cares they're like a nickel a piece*. Every single thing about this video is perfect. eat it. its delish You're probably going to get juice on your hands just cutting it unless you have some dry ass lemons or limes. Just lick it off and wash your hands, its good for you.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvURkpvm0ec "Alright guys we have an entertaining, light hearted, funny, yet engaging RPG that allows us to explore a cool world and interact with a bunch of new characters, should we continue in the same direction?"

"Nah man everyone hates those beloved games lets totally change it"

"Done" Did you ever play Super Mario RPG? It was amazing. iPaper Mario 7


NOW WITH LESS FEATURES! It's like Shrek

1st (not including Mario RPG) was great, really original and fun

2nd was fantastic and a generational gem

3rd was pretty well anticipated but changed far too much and didn't feel like a real continuation of the series.

All the rest were unasked for and just bad. This is pretty much everything with Nintendo. 

 "Oh, you guys loved Metroid Prime? Here's other M and Federation Force. Enjoy!"

"You guys want a new starfox? Here, take this 4 hour game that looks like it was made in 2002!"

 Same with Mario Party. 9 and 10 are terrible, the whole 'everyone moves together' bullshit basically means whoever gets lucky in the last few turns wins. There's no skill or strategy at all anymore.  This is the most probable scenario, as sad as that is. I mean, I think they do some really creative stuff with these new Paper Mario games, but I still think that the original is a damn near perfect game.

I'd honestly settle for a simple HD remaster of the original at this point. HD textures and full 1080p at 60fps would make that game look damn good. Yeah but when you pick them up you can use them, no more 'Sling A Thing'. So you might be able to get the Thing in the level with the Boss and use it for the battle similar to Zelda For you and other people who want this kind of experience in an RPG, I'd highly highly suggest going back to check out Baten Kaitos and its sequel on the GameCube. 

They're turn based RPGs with a deck style combat system. All of your attacks, heals, finishers, and utility moves are cards that must be played to use them. It starts out simple, with 3 or 4 cards played per character, but by the end game you have huge decks with a Pokemon-esque elemental system and 9 card turns where you're trying to set up crazy combos and plays with a card numbering system. It's incredibly fun and deep and I feel it's an overlooked gem of that generation. The problem I think Sticker Star had was that it was a deck builder in a series that's always just been a turn based RPG and people were put off by playing an entirely different genre of game than what was expected. The single biggest issue, IMO. This realisation followed by reading how to actually fight the bosses wrecked the game for me.  I sat back and realised the game was pointless.  Fighting enemies was only detrimental, fighting bosses wasn't hard, just a tedious puzzle, and the in game puzzles were just kinda obtuse.  The story was throwaway, and that was it.  There was literally no point in playing  Agreeing here. I dislike the new ones of both series ... like, Nintendo, ring ring! It's your fans calling. They want the ole good times back. I thought the last Mario and Luigi game is the 2nd best of it's series. 2nd to Bowser's Inside Story, of course. TTYD is one of my favorite RPGs ever and i dont even like the mario franchise all that much Agreed.  I honestly have no idea why they decide to scrap one RPG series instead of keeping both.  Both series are already unique in their own right, just because they're both RPG series doesn't mean they would be too similar. Holy SHIT it took me so, so, so long to get down the race against Boshi. The last one. Jeez.

Also, figuring out the forest maze puzzle for myself. Took me a bit too long, but I got it. I fucking love super mario rpg.  I love jrpgs in general but super mario rpg has always struck a chord with me.

Any time i mention a sequel people just say OH paper mario or the portable mario and luigi games.


They are so so so different.

I tried thousand year door and was so turned off by the simplicity of the game. Every attack did 1 or 2 or some other set low damage with not much rng. No real equipment like armorsor weapons or accessories that do stat boosts. No true parties. Magic system was dumbed down. The elemental statsdidnt seem as magnified either.

Not knl6 that bu5 i feel super mario rpg strayed from the mario formula furthest from any of the games. The types of characters and enemies and plotlines deviate so much. Meanwhile in paper every part memberis typically just a type of character found in every other mario game. Goombas or ghosts or troopas or whatever for the most part.

Im not saying those games were bad but they are very far from the jrpgs that super mario rpg was based on. That makes two of us, plz Nintendo?.. Hit the nail on the head with the whole "We don't play Paper Mario because its paper, that's just a neat atheistic."

I personally hate how the new Mario and characters have a white outline, it draws too much attention to the paper aspect as opposed to it just being neat that they are 2D and can therefore do some paper like things such and fold up and stuff. and honestly, THERE IS good spots in sticker star, combat is neat, the atmosphere was amazing, the abilities are fun, but the levels system back tracking and the stupid peal a part system ruined it. Anima from FFX was always worth watching, to me. I can remember when it first popped up in the FMV, wrapped in bandages and chains, shooting lasers out of it's eyes as it cried in agony. 

One of the weirdest summons in Final Fantasy history, but a great spectacle nonetheless.  http://imgur.com/4JYof6f Yeah I get that part, I'm asking how the post nordicthrust replied to is meta Yeah I get that part, I've seen the xkcd, I'm asking what's meta about it It's hard to have a Gaytime on your own! we'll have a gay old time.

Shh bby is ok Damn it, Nancy! Only a lot. :) The game looks pretty awesome, but yeah, I don't think they could have chosen somebody worse to do the narration. It's so bad... I think they should have gone with a female voice. Not sure who or what style, but anything that's not his voice lol. It just doesn't fit.  It sounds like they just grabbed the first english speaking guy in the office they saw, and used him.  It's like a bad Neil deGrasse Tyson impression The LittleBigPlanet games do it well. Not for Nintendo. Their trailers are always so bad  God bless the '90s. Yeah, like throw in text to explain the beginning and the rest is good without narration. I watched it on mute, got all the info necessary. I think they actually do their va with in house employees so that may not be too far off "Get enough stickers to make shy guys cry like anime fans on prom night!" I don't think any narrator could have saved that line. I still haven't seen that trailer, and I backed the thing. If that doesn't tell you what audience Nintendo is marketing towards I don't know what will. that's exactly what they were doing. look at the art style. also it's not necessarily marketed towards kids neither. that art style is very appealing and kinda surreal.  you had so many choices to pick from and you went with one of the greatest ads in history?

P-P-PEAHATS Though as a counter-point, there *was* [this commercial for Link to the Past](https://youtu.be/u3THavMxNDE). That is clearly someone's cousin. AMA Request this guy please lol No, it's way too high quality for that. They probably recorded it using a novelty spy pen recorder. he's probably reading this right now and crying. Ok let's chop up this lemon and fire it off of our hogs into our mouths! And how did you get to knowing this far? I feel like someone at Nintendo at some point decided that it was solely the paper aspect people loved about paper Mario, not the rpg. What blew me away in Thousand Year Door was the inventiveness.  You'd finish exploring a town and you get on a train and think "OK, explore a new town I guess".

Nope.  Now you're in Murder On The Orient Express and you have to find the killer.  Then you're a luchador.  And all the way through they use the 2d theme to enable brilliant particle effects and hordes of entities that had never been seen on the Gamecube before.

What a game.  They just haven't matched the level of inspiration and execution in Paper Mario since.  The closest I've seen is Mario & Luigi Dream Team on the 3DS. HOT Probably my favorite game of all time to be honest.  Original paper mario was a pretty close second. If only it weren't so hard to get ahold of at a reasonable price... Didn't it have any rpg aspects? It's been so long since I played it but I thought it had plenty. I can't remember the stories in any of them, but it was definitely the most beautiful, IMO.  The screenshots hyped me up so much... *sigh* Apparently the creator of the series basically said "No more  original characters, only use established universe characters" so yeah that's a huge factor to the downfall of Paper Mario. This is why I stopped playing method prime. I felt so alone on the good team In Thousand Year Door, I was predicting a Bob-omb partner but Bobbery was basically nothing what I expected. It was great. The best part is the disco is dead so of course boos love it But it adds up. Two nickels is a whole dime. Can't afford to go throwing dimes around like I'm Mansa Musa.  Where do you get limes? They're like a dollar each here in Canada. Tyurn it. Objection: that is a lime. It's more like:

"Wow, we changed the game from 3d to 2d and people *still* love it! What is it that they love about Paper Mario so much?"

"It's the Paper!"

"What? "

"You know, the art style and the paper gimmick. Everybody loves arts and crafts! Lets put stickers in there too, and base a whole combat system over it. They'll really dig that."

"What about the story, world, and characters?"

"Nah nobody likes those, get rid of them. They just want more *Paper* Mario!" Over, *super paper mario*

And over, *sticker star*

And over, *paper jam*

And over. *splashing* No, I've heard nothing but good things though. Fewer I mean this is about to be the sixth game. So you're not far off But SPM isn't bad, Shrek 3 is awful The...rest? There are more Shrek movies? "Ugh look at Nintendo rebooting beloved games! I bet this Kid Icarus reboot is going to be horri...*ohhhhhhhhh it's good*" Don't forget Mario Party. I swear they didn't always suck so much. 

I'm another note, though, the new SSB, Mario Kart, and LoZ are all amazing improvements over their predecessors (and yes, I can say that before LoZ comes out). [removed] HD TTYD WHEN I haven't played the original, BUT THOUSAND YEAR DOOR WITH HD? Like, I'd get to relive that rush I got when I brought back my first crystal star? Count me in! Having never played Paper Mario in any capacity, this thread is fascinating.  But then again, Super Paper Mario was completely different and I think people still enjoyed it. Hey uh... 1995 called! They want their "Certain year called wanting it's blank back" formula back!

\- Jerry Smith Paper Jam was a pretty big disappointment. Welcome to the real world If there is one thing I dislike about the two new Mario and Luigi is the minimalistic cover art! Just a blank space with Mario & Luigi...what is up with that? I understand where you're coming from, but the problem with Super Mario RPG is that it was *too* far from the Mario feel. It was just a typical JRPG with Mario characters. Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing game and I absolutely loved playing it. But it's definitely more JRPG than Mario.

The first 2 Paper Mario games felt like a true blend of the Mario universe with the RPG formula. One of your complaints is how the party members are just a type of character in any other Mario game, but that's why they're so good. We've only ever seen the typical goombas and koopas without any personality. But now we have characters like Goombella and Koops that have actual depth and uniqueness to them. They aren't just a goomba and a koopa. They're fully fleshed out characters. As for the party system, you always have 2 characters in battle at any given time. That's only 1 less than the 3 you had in Super Mario RPG. Plus the partners are very easy to change out in the middle of battle, especially after you get the quick change badge later on.

And Paper Mario did introduce some new species into the mix like the X-Nauts and Shadow Sirens. Super Paper Mario is chock full of original non-Mario species because of the interdimensional aspect of that game. 

Based on your post, it sounds like you didn't get too far into the game. The combat is one of those "easy to learn but difficult to master" types since it's simple enough on the outside for just about anyone to pick up and play but complex enough deep down for you to use advanced techniques. If all you did was select your attack and then leave it at that, then yes, you did 1 or 2 damage and that was it. But if you look into it more you'll see there are things such as stylish moves (where you press certain buttons at the right time, usually the A button) to do more damage and then there's the superguard technique that requires you to press B within a very very small window of time to completely negate the damage from an enemy attack. 

As for accessories, that's all wrapped up in the badge system. There are badges to increase your damage or increase your defense. There are badges that provide certain protections or allow access to new techniques. There are badges for just about anything you'd expect a piece of armor or accessory to do in a typical JRPG. As for the weapons, as you progress in the story you get upgrades for your boots and hammer providing you with more damage and special techniques. 

As for the RNG, I'll give you that one. There isn't very much RNG in the Paper Mario games. But that's not a bad thing. You have to focus more on strategy than luck and it makes the combat much more compelling. The damage you do is a simple formula of your attack minus their defense. So you have to use strategy, such as using the special quake hammer technique to flip over an enemy with a shell and reduce their defense for a couple turns until they manage to flip themselves back up. 

How far did you get when you played TTYD? I think you might have dropped it a little too soon. I highly *highly* recommend that you give it one more go and play through at least the first 3 chapters. Chapter 3 is definitely my favorite one in the game. If you aren't hooked after that then the game just isn't for you. But if you dropped it before even finishing the first chapter, then I sincerely hope you'll consider giving it one more chance. This time try playing it without comparing it to Super Mario RPG. Just enjoy it as a different type of Mario RPG. I full agree with everything that you just wrote. I still own the cartridge for Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars in my prized, but minimal, SNES collection along side the other greats: FFVI, Chrono Trigger, Lufia 2:Rise of the Sinistrals, Secret of Mana/Evermore. Honorable mentions to Ogre Battle and the Twisted Tales of Spike McFang. It probably subtly refers to another post.

They could have chosen this guy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH0JNSIrBA4 "Okay that was good Jake, but could you try to sound more like you've never done this before?" - Nintendo executive LBP 1 and 2 was really fun.

LBP 3 was a cliff dive. To be fair, anything Stephen Fry does, he does well. Yeah, because they got Stephen Fry, and for him to do it with emotion instead of this whiter-than-white-bread boring guy Oh cmon, the Breathe of the Wild trailer is pretty great [They weren't always bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2m3NgZk7eE) The Legend of Zelda games generally have good to great trailers  (the Twilight Princess E3 debut trailer with the Conan the Barbarian music comes to mind). Kid Icarus Uprising had an awesome debut trailer. Actually, the one nice thing that Nintendo generally does is focus on the gameplay in the trailers. There's hardly ever any footage shot outside the game engine A random Nintendo employee voiced Peach in Mario 64, and since then my sister and I have made a game out of watching for her name in the credits of every single title. She's still with the company and got promoted a few times!

I have no idea why I told this story.

*edit*: Her name's [Leslie Swan](http://www.mariowiki.com/Leslie_Swan) and apparently she thought her voicing Peach was "a stretch." Yep. Little kids will love it, parents will just throw the memory with the pile of all the random shit their kids want, and young adults/fans will just insult the VA like we have here, and then go on with whatever hype we would normally have. "Watch out, Bad Narrator!" His uncle works for Nintendo. Oh god my PTSD  SUPER FIRE The GameCube version of most games was the best. Is it worth a lot? I have a copy. Not getting rid of it because I love it  dearly, but it's be cool if it was worth something. There is always Dolphin.  TTYD was kinda hard to emulate when I played it, mostly due to the paper effects not rendering properly without a bit of tweaking to the controls. There were items, health, leveling, and stuff, but the battle mechanics were the "jump on/hit the enemy" things, not turn-based combat like the other games. But why! Original characters were what made 1000 Year Door so much fun. It was a whole new world with a ton of interesting shit going on. what the hell why would he do this? Honestly it only needs one sidekick: The Penguin we were all denied in the original.

We could all die fulfilled then. Don't forget that Shigeru Miyamoto saw that Sticker Star looked too much like The Thousand-Year Door and told them to start over. Bye-bye, Chain Chomp partner.  Metroid Prime is different, though. It's not an RPG and it's not story-driven. Paper Mario is both. I hear you, but Metroid was always meant to feel isolating. In Mario, having no other chracters is kind of odd. Even the first Super Mario had Luigi in the mix.  I wanted a Bob-omb to blow shit up, not to make me feel things.

*sobs for Bobbery* But you're not losing the whole nickel. You're losing, maybe, a tenth of the nickel's worth of juice per lime.

Can you afford to throw around haypennies? Nice West African reference go to brown people markets they have spice and fruit for not a lot money >Tyurn  

I knew exactly who uploaded it before clicking the link after reading that

 Shit, this *is* what happened. Super Paper Mario wasn't at the same level of the first two, but it was still a great game with a great story and world. It's even still good now. Worth checking out on an emulator for sure! So many awesome secrets, a totally different story from typical Mario, great characters.

Chrono Trigger as well. Awesome. I mean, Paper Jam really isn't a Paper Mario game, it's a Mario and Luigi game featuring Paper Mario.

It's a good Mario and Luigi game, but it's a far cry from the first three Paper Mario games. Super Paper Mario is one of the best Mario games of all time IMO. Shrek the halls

Scared Shrekless

Shrek The Last Chapter I disagree about the Mario kart bit. The series has yet to surpass double dash.  > (and yes, I can say that before LoZ comes out).

If Breath of the Wild ends up sucking (Which I really doubt), I will abandon Nintendo tbh.

They killed Metroid already, so Zelda is all I care about anymore.

That said, I expect it to be great, Nintendo shits on anything that's not their cashcows.  
Zelda and main Mario games are.

Metroid sadly wasnt. wat Now with Dolphin and an HD texture pack. LIFE IS EFFORT AND ILL STOP WHEN I DIE I agree with all your points. However those points are why i dislike the game. OF course super mario rpg was too far from a mario game. That was the entire point. it says RPG on the box. Anyone going in expecting a regular game just can't read/

A troopa or goomba with more characteristics is still a toopa or goomba. Wheres the risk. Wheres the introduction of new types of creatures in the universe. Mallow was a cloud prince and geno was a doll brought to life by higher forces. Super mario rpg was one of the first games that really felt like mario was venturing out of his sphere of normalcy where paper mario games just put him right back to his old stomping grounds. And again having 1 other person in team just feels like it dumbs it down. 

Super mario rpg also had timed hits. I got that point. But it still never advanced passed 4 or 5 damage. It was just kinda too simplistic for me. Ok i will give you some of the strategic things that you had such as jumping enemies from behind. I did like that aspect 

Badges and weapons again seemed like too much hand holding.  I actually enjoy completely equipping and manipulating characters stats.  Ok cool your kicks now ad 2 more damage than before. Ok? 

Honestly its been years since i played ttyd. But i feel no itch to jump back in. Thanks. But isn't that just a reference to something said elsewhere? I don't get how that's meta Lol. We're old. Fred was a huge dick to Barney, tho. Always beating him up and making those weird, acutely angular hairy lumps on his head. Rocky only constantly condescended his sidekick in hilarious battles of wits, leaving the violence to the other cartoons. A life with no slow-clap processor is not a life worth living at all.  Reminds me of [this.](http://i.imgur.com/94LyLm1.png) To be fair, that script is pretty terrible. I don't know what kind of read you were looking for, but I don't think this guy was narrating this off the cuff. Can you imagine being the guy that scribbled this down? After this very take, to have the voice over guy look at you and ask, "Is that what you were going for?" I like to imagine he just shrugged and said "You nailed it." Bullseeeeyyyyeee! Isn't that the voice of Mercer Frey (or almost any elf) from Skyrim? LBP3 was a cash-grab. You could tell because the original developers of LBP had nothing to do with it. That said, the Vita and psp versions were good.  There was a 3? was LBP 3 the one with the four different protagonists? LBP 3 had a lot of potential with the character switching but I felt like they never properly utilized it. There weren't any cool moments or puzzles that were solved by switching characters on the fly and thinking outside the box.

It was soooooo buggy too. Definitely a major disappointment. The lack of MM's development was felt. LBP3 was fine. Main problem with is was it was buggy as shit, but launch window titles are like that sometimes. I still really enjoyed my time with it.  Still better than throwing in nigs. Yeah, it was. But then we have [stuff like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mefP8GIODO4), sooooo Just watched the trailer again and cried in joyous anticipation. I just can't wait to play that game. I'm so excited. It clearly had a mute narrator, but it's a step in the right direction. Breath? Well, it was an interesting read, I did not know that before reading your comment, so thanks! Subscribe Unsubscribe That's a really nice story.  Sometimes I forget people on the Internet can have normal lives. Not everyone is getting their ass frothed by horse jizz. Random employee?  She was senior editor for Nintendo Power and wrote the script for SM64. He gets him all the secret developer cheats that make the girl characters clothes fall off, but they only work for him.  You have to have a special console. I love that game! I SPIT DAT Soul Caliber 2 is a prime example. I'd also say Need For Speed Underground 2 was better on GameCube.  Metroid Prime! It's like 30-50 bucks depending on which one you buy it seems. Nothing too crazy. I guess it seems expensive for such an old game but that's the price of a new game today and the game still holds up so it's reasonable. It's gotten a lot better since the recent updates. It's good enough that if Maleo wasn't such an ass we could run speedruns on emulator. AFAIK, he said people who want to play a Mario RPG should play the Mario & Luigi series, and that he want's Paper Mario to be something else.

And Sticker Star is what we got...and it got rejected. Now he's coming with this, which arguably looks at least a little bit better, but in my opinion he should either go back to the old battle system and bring partners back, or get rid of turn based combat alltogether. Is this for real? That's literally what people have been wanting for so long sobbery Damn fatcats wasting haypennies like it's nothing. You know how many lentils you can buy for that!  "Hi mr. brown man, 2 fruits pls." It was a solid game. It just wasn't Paper Mario. More...2D Mario, expanded universe. I didn't like it.  It was dull. Yeah I think it's great The problem was that it was a Mario game, not a paper mario game, which was why people didn't like it only one of those was actually a full movie though Shrek: Redemption  
Shrek: Resurrection  
SHR8K > Scared Shrekless

I dunno man, TV.com gives it an 8.1 out of 10.  Honestly if they released the E3 demo right now as a finished product it would be less disappointing than some AAA sequels out there. Got a link to an HD texture pack? That is exactly what it means by Meta. Slight reference to another trending post.  So true.  Yup I finished the main story, and it wiped all my data. I can't bring myself to redo it for the trophies. Okay that's enough Reddit for today, my body is ready. Thank you for subscribing to NintenFacts.

done Definitely true, but I couldn't see that story really taking place in another mario game. Kind of an in between. Whaaat? Really? I thought everyone liked that game. When did you play it? 2 Love 4 Shrek I've seen it, I thought Shrek the Halls was better but the characters do stay true to themselves, so it's very cannon. However the writing is just plain bad. Maybe it's because I was much younger when I first saw the original shreks and I outgrew the non-adult humor.  https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-paper-mario-ttyd-hd-texture-pack-v0-8d-september-9-2016 But that's not what the word meta means...

Did you know that, during the early days of Nintendo, money was quite scarce in the business.  Had it not been for the investment of a retired Japanese Sumo and the father of the young man who would go on to become the WWF's Ultimate Warrior, such amazing characters as Super Mario and Bill, the guy that rides the Excitebike, might have never been created?

 I got that level on a Twitch stream I was running. I had been through a particularly grueling set of levels beforehand, so I was pretty unhappy. I stopped doing Mario Maker streams because of how much it made me hate people. So I went into that one feeling particularly resigned to what was most likely going to suck.

... I managed to get through the room in about five seconds. It was probably the greatest moment of my life.  I've beaten that level before.  Yeah, it was a pain trying to keep track of yourself.  If you really lose yourself, just restart the level. I'm glad at least one of us was able to get ahold of an NES Classic this weekend.  Lovely.  Why does this get 6000 upvotes... Pointing a camera at a screen is a cardinal sin of the internet. Hoooolllyyyyy shhiiiiit... thiiiiiis giiiiiiiiiiffff iiiiiissssss ssssooooooo slllooooooooowwwwww....

Why the fuck does this no quality trash have any up votes. Wtf OP. You didn't post what game it is. What an asshole. Time to..... spring into action.

 Yes HAHAHAHA
That is absolutely fantastic.  Send that shot to dashie This is the definition of a cluster fuck.  So...Couldn't you just hold right and eventually get through? WTF!? Yikes! Right before the end of the level too. :( Whooooo aaammmmmm iiiiiiiii?!?!? I don't get it can someone explain?  What's the issue here? This isn't even that bad compared to some Super Mario Maker levels. Expert levels on Super Mario Maker in a nutshell right there.... I could vomit. Lost it immediately 100% positive I have seen Witwix play and beat this level I want to see what happens next... lmao wtf It's from Game Center CX, Japanese TV show where "Chief Arino"(Shinya Arino) tries to finish some old games.

 Well, I hate everything about this. I've actually beat this one. It's really fun playing it with a group of friends and everyone trying to keep track of where it is. Good times. Just isolate yourself to the far left/right of the wall.

https://youtu.be/dtqfiDAYCO4?t=50m30s They ever going to update this game again? I feel like Nintendo had good intentions with super Mario maker, but it then evolved into the most sadistic "Saw level maker survival game with a Mario skin" on the planet Old post: check

 Is it easier or harder than I Wanna Be The Guy? Doesn't help that you don't actually get to see the whole screen and the camera is shaking.

Not saying it's easy but it's harder to judge when there are added challenges (like once it goes off screen, there is no way I'm finding it again). Someone has managed to achieve that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ahSZhZna24  
Ah, those Asians... It goes offscreen after the first or second bounce so it's gg from there... I'm pretty sure it's getting gangbanged in the top corner. probably because it goes off screen... It actually goes straight off the right side of the screen, so impossible to follow. When (if) it comes back on to the screen it's surrounded by dozens of others. Only reason I lost it was because it went off screen where the camera didn't pick it up. to keep track of myself i stayed crouched ^^true lost it off screen. But it is dumb anyway [Better?](http://i.imgur.com/wdBJlbm.gifv) That was 60MB!? Rip phone data. My phone on my home wifi couldn't even play it. It's not like it has to be high quality.... That explains why Reddit has used 8 gigs in the past week.  This explains why I saw a black screen and thought my Internet was out  THANK YOU.

When are we going to **ban pure GIFs**? It's such an obsolete and inefficient format... My browser even crashed while loading it. My phone screen timed out before it loaded  That would be why my phone was taking forever. I knew it was big, but wow. Fucking this. I waited about 10 sec for it to load then came to the comments looking for someone sane.  This guy gets it What's even worse is the reposting. I thought this was the point... This is a gif?  I thought it was a pic. .. AND, it's a fucking video, of a TV playing an extremely low resolution game! Fuck! didnt even know they were possible. hes never heard of youtube? ;D Ouch!

Ahhh you fuck! why they do that?!  Fawuck! Gauddaemit! 

Koopa. You are a cawuksucka I keep rewatching it hoping Mario jumps a little flatter.  I can't be the only one who went "Tuh luh tuh luh, tuh tuh tuh" in his head after watching this.  Needs more giant flying Bowsers. Would you mind lowering the frame rate a bit more? Thanks at least Mario got that last coin Is that Kaizo world rom hack? Fuck this hell. I'd rather see Melanias nudes.  Reminds me of super Mario frustration I don't think you can crouch in mid air in mario maker So you know which one you are but what then?  All I see is the pipe you came in from.   and Hitler.
 And that's it's cam footage of a display. ...and the vertical video syndrome I've played it... you're a dick. 

Edit: I mean that in the nicest way possible. How would you not know for sure. :P  I've run across this gif a good many times before and assume the level is therefor pretty popular. What are some of your other levels?  I made this level LOVE this show I've been wanting to watch it properly sometime, but I started with kind of an early episode and wasn't really caught by it. What episode would you recommend to see first to really get into it? AFBB-0000-0084-04CD Super Mario Maker is a game for the WiiU that lets you design your own levels and submit it online for others to play, and it has all kinds of odd power ups, like springs, Star Fox, Link, ect ect. *RubberNinja bc its 60 MB Indeed. 

The entire point of the show is that Arino is suppose to suffer (as his staff worries if they're going to make the last train home or not) Yes, first thing I thought of. it would be hilarious.  I was gonna say he would freak out, but he's gonna do that no matter what way he's trolled in Mario maker. in the chat lads Goddamn it, Ross  they should, I wanna see him lose his damn mind over this level lol People love a good repost fast for me. Your internet? Super Mario Maker? [deleted] A strong hit of salvia  That's probably the level start.  Super Mario Maker is a Wii U game that lets you create your own Super Mario levels. Part of that is also giving you hundreds of different costumes for Mario to wear.

One of those costumes is a spring, which is one of the items you can spawn by the hundred in Super Mario Maker. I've never seen witwix fail at any level. Mario Maker isn't a 3DS title, though...? http://nes123.com/ It is indeed. What's happening here? A front page post is being posted again. We call this a "repost." mario maker i believe, for wii u Sure, for the Switch Yeah, it's annoying but it's not all that impossible, it's just that it's filmed shittily and the player jumps off that side of the screen immediately. Other than that it'd be possible for most people to do in a couple of tries, it's not all that different from a typical cup game. Also that you can control it... you would be able to tell which one is going the directions that your are trying to go It's easier in real life since you can control the thing a little.  If you wiggle it a few times, you can calibrate which one is the correct one, in a sense. His strategy was pretty clever. If you stay compressed you can see which one you are. Clear percentage is surprisingly high. Did you just assume his race?  The power up mushroom (spring) has a slightly different sprite IIRC, assuming this is Super Mario Maker. Yes. Thanks. But that's what OP should have posted :) Maybe you need to make a tutorial for OP. mirror

for the ctrl-F'ers The real MVP. And for some reason the gif seems to be of better quality lol How do you make small gifs?  Thank you. Wish I hadn't waited 5mins for OP's behemoth to get anywhere before checking the comments now HOLY YES. The original ran in super slow motion most of the time and took a full minute to loop. On my computer, at least. You are the hero reddit deserves   Yes thank you. Without this link I would have never seen it on a tablet! Wow it plays correctly right away. How bizarre. Just set up another one, I'm sure you phone will understand. Are you going to sit there and tell me you don't want 4k resolution of a cell phone recording of a TV screen? What... How?? Are you watching hour long gifs on the regular or something?  I thought there was a bot who converted these for us Most image hosts were pretty far along in that, but then reddit made their own image host that only handles oldschool gifs. /r/gaming always had the hugest gifs, I don't even look at them on my phone because they can't load. I 110% support a ban. **ahem** *That's what she said* The Hall of Dead Marios.

went there once with my family as a kid, creeped the hell out of me. [Then the guy who made this must be the Anti-Christ](https://youtu.be/in6RZzdGki8) I have a special wish where I get to play Mario Maker with the person who designed it getting teleported to sit next to me as I play. If there's ever an unavoidable death or a cheap death, I get to backhand them. Architecture and Design? Yeah, the engineering labs. To be fair, this happened in the original game as well. Pretty crowded there, this is pretty common in Mario maker levels It's called a Kaizo block, referencing the infamous Kaizo Mario. Speedruns if Kaizo Mario are some of the most insane feats of human-controlled button execution ever. I'd provide links, but mobile Total new to this....what game is this where people can design their own mario maps?? It's shit level design plain and simple. A cheap trick to create difficulty without imaginatively creating an actual challenge. It's their own levels Bitch please https://youtu.be/in6RZzdGki8 [Still the hardest game out there](https://youtu.be/EzxJgWbm_3I?t=147) Strongly disagree. This is a GUARANTEED death; skill doesnt enter into it, the block is invisible.  Wow. I thought I was good at platformers because I got to Bandage World in Super Meat Boy... Turns out? Not good at platformers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r86NLwCYXfk anyone? Worse than fuckin Panic! At The Disco. That sounds wonderful!
 That game isn't rage inducing, it's just boring. Poorly designed and really dated by today's standards. No no, you play Eryi's Action! That isn't very Kaizo though... No, it's Mario maker. You can. What about bad frame rate GIFs of Hitler? Godwin's Law I made it

Source: Am Nintendo me too. its a shame it takes forever for new subbed episodes to appear on gamingcx.com Thanks  That wasn't actually too hard, and I'm pretty bad at Mario.  At what point do you people just start making webms? I cannot tell the difference as he literally yells at everything regardless of severity. Worked fine after it loaded but the first play though was glacial.  That's the definition of unbeatable.   Well some he just skips because they are pure shit levels lol. [What?  Here it is right here, on Nintendo's site](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-mario-maker-for-nintendo-3ds).  Turns out it's not out yet but I've seen it advertised everywhere, and will be pretty similar to the Wii version. AWESOME! Cool thank you  Well it's the first I'm seeing of this and I don't remember this being a level in any Mario game I guess  The Switch is single screen isn't it? Yeah just wiggle side to side constantly and you will be the minority and easier to spot. The other NPC ones cannot do that unless collided with. 

Edit someone pointed out that in that iteration of smbs you cannot change it.

Edit 2: not sure who to believe.... insert fry squint eye meme.  I'm still confused where is he wtf It only took me a minute to think that exactly. I noticed before he went down the pipe, that he could "crouch". It just seems logical.

Edit: Awww, how cute. I am getting mass downvoted for pointing out that I figured out the trick myself and somewhat quickly. Go ahead, pile um on! I was about to suggest that...then I saw this post The video is titled in Japanese, the voice over is in Japanese, and all the in-game text is in Japanese. He's obviously German. I recognize his voice - he put pee-pee in my Coke once.  goddamn it you guys leave OP alone, its not his fault he was born that way I'm a mthr-F'er. Not a ctrl-F'er.  Because with imgur/gfycat/etc, the video will always just be another lossy re-encode of the gif, so it will always lose some quality, whether perceivable or not. With this game being simple shapes and limited colours, the actual frames for this gif can start off looking high quality because it's easy for the gif format to encode. So when another re-encode happens to serve a video, the quality drop is noticeable. I just reuploaded it to imgur, the not-shitty-image-hosting-website.

I could have uploaded it to GFYcat as well and that would have also helped. As long as they let them know BEFORE they're supposed to be there Only if it's of an 8-bit game. Just browsing /r/aww a lot. And any YouTube video played within the Reddit app counts, however I've got some data usage in the middle of the night when I don't use the app, not too sure why that's happening.  A million reddit pages are a casualty, one 60 MB gif is a tragedy (to your phone data) Posts to .gif files on sites that support gifv/gfycat's video format should just be removed. They're baron on my data and by the time I 'tap' play. Boom, 4G has just blown 25mb on a 10 second gif of what was originally a video.

Like, the original video would have been less data via Youtube because it dynamically changes quality based on device/speed. Rather than accidentally choking down a very large HD Gif file of a video snippet. Or clicking a gif that's absolutely shit quality just so it'd load/play without too much data.

Video Formats are the answer for Videos.


-------------

But even then, in programming never trust user input. Why doesn't Imgur/Gfycat redirect based on your user agent and known compatibility. If your browser requests a XXXXXX.gif file, and the site knows you support mp4 because you're on {The latest version of firefox} or something. Why the fuck aren't they redirecting so we can't blame users?

And why does gfycat even ALLOW you to select the .GIF original files? (Example: http://giant.gfycat.com/OrdinarySilentCopperhead.gif)









------------

Edit: /u/calmed_down_satan has made it apparent that RES already does this for PC.

Home and Office networks being the cheapest GB to $$ ratio that's pretty alright for load times, but clicking the .gif links to load them directly still kicks you over to the slow load times (in typical home network speeds).

And this is the same on mobile regardless, where quota matters most. https://youtu.be/MvJwqr4aiuQ?t=20 In Italy, we just call them graveyards.  I googled that. I wanted to believe... I've been there, actually I love this video.  If you look closely he uses save states -- sometimes the time will jump backwards. Not that the video isn't hilarious or his gameplay isn't impressive! that was well done It's still not cat Mario  This video is friggin hilarious. You did that, Mario! Old hat! From the few clips I've seen, I'd say your hand would get sore pretty quickly. IGN had a decent series where two guys would go back and forth making/playing each others cheap as balls levels. They didn't push it nearly as far as they could have but it was pretty great.

Achievement horse from Achievement Hunter/Rooster Teeth is also similar and fantastic. YES.  As someone who has over 200 Super Expert clears fucking fuck yes.

Fuck you everyone who thinks putting invisible coin blocks to trap you in somewhere you can't escape is a good idea.

Fuck you everyone that thinks having a thwomp offscreen you can't see is a good idea.

Fuck you everyone who thinks putting an enemy right next to you at the start of the stage so you die unless you're holding a certain way or jumping as soon as the stage appears is a good idea.

Fuck you everyone who thinks invisible coin blocks solely to be in your way so you can't make the natural jump path you want to take is a good idea or even a valid thing to put in Mario.

And fuck you to everyone who makes levels that absolutely require advance tech like shelljumping, mid-air spring jumping, or anything of a similar nature.  Kaizo has no place in standard Mario. Wow, that video is almost 10 years old. You can hear his happiness go down after every death. The commentary is what made that. I remember watching this video years ago and laughing my ass off. a true classic Yeah the other one is way harder than this one. 11:34 Wooo^o^o^o YEAA^A^A^A^A^A! the original You haven't lived until you've had your dreams shattered:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYl-6JJsq2U#t=53s Ah the memories. This is the first video I thought of as well Rabi Ray Rana?  Not even close. I wanna be the guy is baby food compared to its [fangames.](http://cwpat.me/fangame-intro/)
 This video is triggering the fuck out of me... I want to throw my controller just watching it. Does anyone know the name of the song during the Mike Tyson boss fight around 4:30? The Kid made some bandages in Super Meat Boy so much easier to get.

Makes I Wanna Be The Guy worth being made Does Mike Tyson start breathing FIRE?? In Mario maker, you have to clear your own level before you can upload it for others. Naturally there are a few types of levels:

1. Literally impossible unless you know where the creator has that one hidden star in some random corner of the game. Flat out bullshit
2. Full of invisible troll blocks, known as "kaizo" blocks from the popular rom hack Kaizo Mario
3. Elegantly difficult levels with minimal kaizo interference


Most good developers make levels between 2 and 3. A good kaizo block is one that makes the player take alternate routes/strategies. Too many and it's obnoxious, but if you watch a few of the above dude's videos, you can see in general what a good number of kaizo blocks is in a lot of popular hard content. Mario Maker is a year strong and the hard level community is really great, I really recommend you check out streamers/videos. The level he linked actually has a double kaizo block at the end, along with several along the way.  It's a lot more than just a fake checkpoint.   It's not about the level itself, it's about the unusable checkpoint which is really rage inducing Worse than an R.L. Stine book!  https://int3.github.io/open-syobon-action.js/ Well yeah, but it's also old as fuck and one of the first "troll mario" games as far as I'm aware. That was very convincing Maybe not in smb1?  You couldn't in the original. http://i.imgur.com/gljHX0N.gif you know i never thought of it that way? Haha I did nazi that coming  I'm Dirty Dan! My dad made it. 

Source: He works for Nintendo I made it

Source: Am Bowser Annnnnd I will file this show away as a watch later thanks for the website. Yeah, it's mostly just funny You people? Literally every level in mario maker is beatable. You can't upload a level unless you beat it. The major difference is that the 3DS game cannot go online and you can only share levels by streetpass. If you want an online community full of thousands of levels to try out, you need the Wii U version. What in the world.. I've literally not heard about that until you linked it. I believe it's a player created level in mario maker This is complicated by the fact that if it's original nes mario physics, then you can't change your momentum once you're in the air. Nah you're right. That guy is wrong. You can go on top of a brick that's directly above you by wiggling in SMB1. He's the spring. [At the end here](http://i.imgur.com/mYALhHg.jpg)

[Then he gets sprung 2 more times and end up here about to go in](http://i.imgur.com/8QxkIRL.png) I actually don't know why you're getting downvoted sure you said you figured it out but you weren't smug about it. I think if people *brag* about something they deserve a nice kick in the nads but you seem so harmless! Have an upvote Wow, can you do an AMA? I SUPPORT YOU FUCK THESE HATERS  wow u smert To be fair, I only downvoted you to be polite.
You did ask after all  Yeh man have an up vote fuck them  Now I'm just upvoting you out of spite. Ok!  You know you are a real piece of work making the rest of us feel bad like that. How do you sleep at night You can't think for yourself, not for one second. And *figuring something out*, oh the audacity.  The guys at NASA would like to get in touch. Did you just assume his nationality? [Twice referenced](http://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5cryjd/studio_ghiblis_hayao_miyazaki_is_coming_out_of/d9z3aju) in one day? Sweet. Yeah because GFYcat accepts video

Rather than people going Videorip>gif>video when its uploaded you can just cut out your scene, upload. Done.

It saves so much bandwidth but people don't care enough to learn.

You even still have people posting the .gif original files to gfycat links for fuck sake :( Pretty sure your YouTube watching is what's taking a majority of your data. It takes me some time to use up even a gb while just normally browsing Reddit but one four minute YouTube video with higher than 144p quality shreds through data.  Ah didn't even think about youtube videos. I mostly have wifi everywhere, so I barely put a dent into my 4gb plan.  Be the change you wish to see in the world.  the .gif you linked is automatically an embedded webm for me jesus christ, i didnt knw mario characters could give me nightmares That is is some ridiculously high production quality. When he was looking at the dead Marios, he should've said: "It'sa... me." That needed about 75 more minutes.
Reminds me of Evil Dead.  Hah! I have never seen that before, that's a great video - especially the applied effects.

Anyone know what software package most video editors use to achieve post production effects like you see  in this video? 

Is Adobe After Effects still the go to application? Curious is all! Jesus Christ Whenever I would stay up waaaaay too late playing Super Mario 64, this is kinda how I'd feel I smoked a lot of weed and this was amazing Come to my nightmares Username checks out. im pretty sure its not even him playing. just a guy talking over gameplay footage he found >It's still not kaizo

FTFY When is it going to be remastered and released No love there for I Wanna Be The Boshy or I Wanna Kill The Guy? Boshy I got half way through the game before I had a rage induced stroke.  it's the punch out theme. kind of obvious when you think about where the mike sprite is from Carlsagan42 if you want to be entertained by a smart man. And then there are levels like this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFIEpZD3enk I think one of my favourite kaizo tricks has to be for super Mario world for the SNES that involves boss bass. The end of level kaizo block is not rage inducing? Even more than a mid-game checkpoint? At least someone caught the joke. Good thing I have W Blue Sky lives. I was lying. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ahSZhZna24

This guy is doing it in this very map. It is common knowledge that you can crouch when airborne. This guy is factually wrong. I believed him (or her) until you cast doubt.  It's Mario. If you need that much convincing on what you can/can't do, I'm going to question whether or not you've played a video game before. This makes me fuhrerious  I am Sparticus!  You're welcome! :D This is super mario maker. You CAN change your momentum mid-air, because despite using old graphics the game uses the new physics. You can change direction mid-air in original smb.  Is this true? I feel like it can't be because you can jump to a block straight above you in the original NES mario... That's definitely not true. Well, you're still able to slightly influence the distance you jump in SMB1. The problem, iirc, is that all 4 themes in Mario Maker use the New SMBU physics, just a different coat of paint. >This is complicated by the fact that if it's original nes mario physics, then you can't change your momentum once you're in the air.

Oh shit didn't consider that as it's been awhile since I've thought of smbs1 thank you lol I really wasn't trying to be smug. I watched OPs post a few times, and yea, I feel like that was totally diabolical. After about the third or fourth time through though, like I said, I noticed you could crouch. Fuck me for admitting I figured it out. Yea, I don't get reddit sometimes. I FUCK YOU SUPPORT THESE HATERS And I do not fault you for that.  I am sorry. I will remember to flagellate myself 500 times before bed. Yeah wtf, why haven't I made an image/video hosting site yet. Yes, RES has begun tackling this issue. Which I'm quite happy about. Hell maybe that's just built into reddit? I have RES and got that behavior so cant tell. It's probably RES though.

But visiting the site/clicking that link directly, the site just gives you the GIF.

Same on mobile (NoRES) where quota matters most. That's, like, the last Boss' (Wart?  I know it wasn't Bowser in that one) only job in Super Mario Bros 2 fucking luigi man, i knew that motherfucker was up to no good!!! There's lots of outfits on YouTube doing these fx driven videos these days. The tools and knowledge have just gotten so accessible. Very true.  But, on the other hand, part of the desolate creepiness is there being no voices, I guess. For the 3d stuff usually Cinema 4D or 3DS Max or even blender. Fire and particle and destruction stuff is usually done in Houdini or Rayfire.

After Effects for everything else! That's my fetish  The purpose of that website is to introduce people to the "lesser known" fangames since a lot of the community is sick of seeing boshy.  That makes too much sense lol. I haven't played punch out since the mid 90s but the music sounded so familiar. Thank you for the answer though.  That level may have had a checkpoint that wasnt blocked. [For those out of the loop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in6RZzdGki8)  http://imgur.com/UqBSVWb *mario maker* You definitely can because that's the trick to getting to world -1 That's because there's no momentum... Reddit has an amazing fickle and pissy hivemind.


 I SUPPORT FUCK HATERS YOU THE!!  But I really wanted to upvote you Are you incapable, or does it just seem too daunting? :-)  2 was so confusing, but gave us so many characters we love. Great info - thank you very much friend! With Element 3D you can do a pretty great job of integrating 3d models right there in After Effects these days. Cum to my nightmares. hey guys room for one more?  http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/thats-my-fetish-gifs.jpg Played as classic Mario. Even if that weren't the case, I'd be curious to hear how the basic controls changed. I think he meant you can stand beneath a block, jump, maneuver around the block while midair, and land on top of it.  Careful laddy if I didn't know better I'd think you were trying to be an individual. That sort of talk is likely to get yah a paddlin. Yea. I wish I could say I am completely immune to it, but I have jumped on a bandwagon once or twice myself so I am not really pissed about it, just think it was stupid to mass downvote me for pointing out I solved a puzzle.  I FUCK! I FUCK YOU HATERS SUPPORT THE! By all means, go ahead then. When people knock SMB2 and how it just doesn't go with the rest, I like to remind them of all the characters we got from that game. 2 was a rebranding of Doki Doki Panic, which is why all the characters are different. Yup! Lets turn this nightmare into a fever dream! Totally thought of jasper from *The Simpsons* when I read "paddlin" - "*Talking back, that's a paddling.*" It's actually quite amazing.


Go against it and you get downvoted to hell, make a pee joke on askreddit and suddenly you have 1500 upvotes This guy fucks SMB2 does go with the rest, but what we got outside of Japan wasn't SMB2. SMB2 is what got re-released as, "The Lost Levels". Nintendo was worried that the success of SMB would be ruined if they released the real SMB2, because the game was much more difficult than SMB and felt it would frustrate players that weren't as skilled as Japanese gamers. Instead they layered Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad over the characters of their original game, "Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic" and released it to the American audience. The game had a few similarities such as the coin noise, "POW" blocks from the original Mario game, and a musical score by the same composer. It was the easiest option to get the game released and kinda look like it was planned like that.  
Look up the whole article and history on it. It's interesting. But basically they thought it wouldn't sell good and ruin the brand so they released an easier version, which was actually a completely different game. Plus it was fun as hell SMB 2 as we know it wasn't SMB 2. Let's make this fever dream into reality Good catch! that's what I  was going for. 1500, you say... I heard that once. Thought it was a rumor Keeping in mind this decision was made far before the internet was a thing, so the idea of western players being upset about playing an inferior version was laughable because that knowledge would be obscure trivia at best. Now that the internets out, it's actually fairly common knowledge Fun thing is that Doki doki panic started out as a SMB2 for japan before they went in the original direction. As someone who has been to hell, I am somewhat surprised at your characterization of the place. Are you some kind of undead masochist? We all know that, but that's what it's called This is straight out of The Rocketeer

edit: Thank you for the gold! When the zeppelin goes, sometimes it's like everyone stops shooting and looks up. Because if you don't, it's gonna land on you. 

Yes, it is.

Every fucking time. I hope in the full video he waits till the guy runs all the way to the end and jumps towards a passing plane to save him........

Then snipes him in mid air  Jesus christ that's Jason Bourne "Come over."

Trying to reenact flyboys.  https://youtu.be/Pw2FXkc30D8?t=42 

Awesome to see that the game looks better than this movie did.  "oh crap oh crap oh crap OH CRAP running running running RUNNING!" "Just down your sights folks, you can see a wild main protagonist in its natural habitat." Ahh yes, we see here the unfortunate soul that spawned with his squad member just moments before the airship exploded I had a cartoon moment with my friend last week.  We were both in a plane occupying the gunner seats, we had just taken some damage so the pilot was repairing.  a good 3-6 seconds pass and my buddy says, "hey its too quite, do you hear the plane?"   We both turn and the pilot is gone, the plane is heading in a semi nose dive into the face of the mountain and me and my friend are scrambling to get in the pilot seat.  I guess we kept spamming 'A' and just kept bouncing around, because neither of us ever got into the pilot seat we just kept hopping in between the guns.

We both died, best laugh ever. Also helps we both play high as fuck. "SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT" "Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d98xU5Jf-Ek I...I think that's me.

Around two weeks ago, still relatively new to Battlefield 1, I bailed out of a plane and aimed my parachute at the blimp, it seemed like a good idea until I looked at the front and it started exploding. I ran to the back and jumped off. I was too preoccupied with running from the fire that I didn't open the parachute. Just to let you guys know the [stunt double](https://www.vidble.com/ieJvpIE9zw.mp4) didn't make it.  I'm sure he'll be fine. Did he make it?!?! *Pirates of the Caribbean music intensifies* That's TOM CRUISE! how did people think battle zeppelins were a good idea? THEYRE LITERALLY FLOATING BOMBS. That man popped not one but two sticks of five gum. Why didn't you headshot that dude? What a waste.  Holy fuck, 100k upvotes. Source? [*INTENSE KAZOO*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt7VHYqJM0s&feature=youtu.be) Fled Zepplin I wonder what Led this Zeppelin to catch fire? Everyone of us talking about the Rocketeer, we all know how old we are. I see he went to the Prometheus School of Running Away From Things This is how it feels to chew Five Gum Holy shit, 101k karma due to the new karma system.  This sums up IT rather well. I have no clue why I'm laughing my ass off. This is great. http://i.imgur.com/uAcfP0k.gif r/michaelbaygifs Lana be careful! Jesus, the helium! This reminds me of the first time playing through halo 1 Coop with my older brother.  Last level he was driving the warthog and I was on the gun per our usual setup. Right before the end he hits a wall and launches us out of of the warthog. 

For those who haven't played there were two sword elites at this point and it was pretty much up in the air if you made it past them or not.  We were also really young which probably made the shit a lot harder.  

Anyway my brother and I get launched to almost the same place and we see the sword guys.  Motherfucket doesn't even hesitate headshots one and then starts to spray and pray the other yelling right in my ear "RUUUUUUN". I book it and he is literally shit talking this elite while backing him away.  Shit was straight out of alien 3 "is that all you got!" 

Brother dies and he drops the controller. I still had the chance to win it for us.  Whispering now "you can make it. Go you can make it"  Made the back bird and won the game.

Its been years and many halo games since then and the few times he has even played though the campaign solo he has stopped before the end and handed the controller over to me to win the game.

Fuck I need to call my brother.  A reddit post with over 100k votes? The reality as we knew it is falling apart! "OH FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK"
 The funny thing is he's probably just some new player who got lost. Gifs that end too soon 😐 RUUUUUUUNNNNNNNN

It all starts back in 1913..." https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5e9eyu/racing_the_explosion/ Thanks to the recent Reddit rules update, this post has 100k upvotes and is currently 11th top post ever. Wow! this is top of reddit? Lmao Hey you're right https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_UJ3mVuxEA&feature=youtu.be  Well, damn. Now I need to watch it. The mob and FBI teaming up to fight Germans never gets old  Hope he has enough Beeman's Chewing Gum. Genuinely surprised you're the only comment referencing that, twas the first thing I thought of. Who are they going to believe? OP, or the number-three box-office star in America?  What's it like working for a nazi, Eddie? He pay you in dollars or Deutsche marks? Vee are losing altitude... vee must drop some veight! first thing I thought of. One of my favorite movies  Your age is showing. I only played the video game. I think it was on super nintendo, it was hard as hell. Oh my prince, would that you'd drink of my lips as deeply. I think that really captures the feel of WWI. Like, "Last month I was a dirt farmer and now the sky is falling"  Even if you're underground in a damn bunker *you still die*. I've had it land on me more times than I care to admit.

fucking zeppelin.. Saw a Zep carcass crush a heavy tank. I was on foot and that metal beast was about to blast me and then KaBoom! From the Gods! 
So epic. This sounds fun af. Yup, hopped in a heavy tank full of people and was driving to the battle. All of the sudden the zeppelin lands right on top of me and blew up the tank and it's contents.

Sorry squad. Just wondering as someone who hasn't played the game... are there any scenarios in Battlefield 1 that involve a zeppelin, where the zeppelin doesn't explode in flammable ball of fiery satisfaction? Because it seems to me like a real "chekhov's gun" thing to put in the game, even in multiplayer. 
 Kind of like in Battlefront when everyone is shooting the walker on the last set of uplinks He runs to the end of the zeppelin and jumps off doing a 360 no scope to an enemy pilot and then lands in the cockpit of the stolen plane and flies off into the sunset  Lucky this is based on WWI, the Geneva convention outlawed shooting parachuting soldiers. Nonono he jumps off and lands in the side seat of which Anakin is flying and says "what took you so long?" > Jesus christ that's Jason Bourne

EDIT: Thanks for the gold friends. I don't know if 5 minutes of video editting was worth it though.  Jesus Bourne that's Jason Christ  [deleted] I knew the comments on this post would be something special Perfect. Someone needs to make a 'behind the gif' of this...  I love Reddit  lmao  Seriously, that was probably the coolest BF video I've ever seen even if it was something so simple. We need to see the running guy's point of view!  But it DID end too soon. Badass jump or badass headshot? Yeah that was the coolest video ever. I want to see someone else do it or a different angle/longer video, etc.

I want more! https://media.giphy.com/media/130PcuraTvI8Kc/giphy.gif Do all classes have parachutes? Otherwise this might be the first case where the Prometheus school of Running Away from Things might be successful Running to the side doesn't guarantee 5000 k karma in 1 hour though, does it? The Explosion gets you. Must have trained at Prometheus School of Running Away From Things. you're welcome [Here's the other side](https://streamable.com/6hjr) Yeh first real laugh i've had  me too thanks I laughed till I cried, it's safe to say that you made my day. Thank youuuuuuuuuuu! God I loved that game...also killin' people with drop pods. Battlefield Vietnam was my favourite. The soundtrack to that game was epic, riding in the back of a jeep firing the .50 cal with fortunate son blasting on the radio Battlefield 2142 is when I upgraded to jihad transport helicopters straight into them walkers. great game! Really hope they consider a 2143 someday.  Best battlefield ever I believe, though my time with BC2 is a close second. That was my favorite one. RIP :( *"I saw him deploy a parachute at 100 feet! His genes need to carry on"* wow, the trailer movies from bf1 look 100X better than this "Firing main cannon" Bad day Bad day BAD DAY!!!!! "Oh crap oh crap oh crap, oh crap on a CRAP CRACKER!" Must go faster. Must Go faster! MUST GO FASTER!! "Ain't running from myself no more" This is too true for me. Goodbye. THE SOLDIER FROM THE MOUNTAIN.... Dishonor! Dishonor on you!  Dishonor on your family! Dishonor on your cow! That ladder approaching them... Were they flying at 9 miles per hour? I jumped into adobe premiere and fixed that for you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_UJ3mVuxEA&feature=youtu.be  this should be more popular I have also done this. Many have. Many failed. No, this is Patrick. "We are losing." WHY DID HE LOOK BACK??? STOP BLO'IN HOLES IN MA SHIP!!! In reality, Zeppelins could fly high enough that most planes' and ground-based weapons couldn't reach them. Also, their interiors were segmented so a few punctures wouldn't deflate them, and regular bullets and shrapnel proved not to ignite them. Special explosive and incendiary rounds had to be developed to do the job.

When the war began, zeppelins were the most developed form of aviation in the world, and were the one area where Germany were firmly ahead of everyone else. It would have been dumb *not* to try to use them to their advantage, despite their vulnerabilities.

 Probably for intimidation, you see this huge floating thing slowly coming closer to you, all the while shooting and dropping bombs. I won't lie -- it's not my vid, I just saw the gif in the web, on Russian network VK. If someone knows how it ends and whether the sniper makes the shot or not -- please do tell! I would think maybe the guy felt he had enough problems going on without getting headshot.  new top post of all time. really makes me sad that the "Darth JarJar" post is gone. Username checks out That was perfect. Holy Shit. Did you leave that unlisted on purpose? Because i would love to share it with some friends. This had me grinning like a child. Great work.  My god that's amazing editing. 

I love the in game flyby and pickup off the top of the Zeppljn. 

"Need a lift?" I am rarely impressed. I sir, am one impressed mofo.  I literally couldn't tell the 2 apart. Also am stoned That was the best thing I've ever seen I love that glance they give each other when they're blasting.   And staring at a young Jennifer Connelly also never gets old.  /swoon At least we know what he's thinking 
"FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKK!!!!" Remember. You can patch any hole with bubble gum. "I may not make an honest buck, but I'm 100% American. I don't work for no two-bit Nazi." Also based on true facts. You know things get real when even criminals get to show their allegiance.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborations_between_the_United_States_government_and_Italian_Mafia I was surprised too. I've accepted that not many people hold the Rocketeer in as high esteem as I do. 

Edit: I see the Rocketeer fans have come. Sweet -music cuts-. Freeze frame. "I bet youre wondering how i got on top of that burning zepplin.".. How does one farm dirt? What type of farmer are you?

IM A LEAD FARMER, MOTHERFUCKER Not really, there weren't so many zepellin explosions in WWI to make it a "thing" Maybe the fire consumes the oxygen? That's the whole point of flamethrowers. Point it into a bunker and asphyxiate everyone inside, and of course burn them to death. But, you know, from the lungs-out. It's the only way to capture this B point It comes out when the losing team falls behind by a certain degree, to give them a fighting chance. It can seat multiple players and has some hellacious firepower, and it takes a lot to destroy it.

But when it does go...and it almost always does eventually...it's pretty amazing to watch. It's absolutely massive, so you end up in these nightmare-like scenarios where you're running, and *feel* like you should be safely out of the way...it doesn't look like it's coming down or moving laterally all that fast. But that's because it's so fucking huge. It's still over you. Still over you. Still over you. Splat.

Some maps have an armored train or a battleship instead. It's not the same though.
 It only explodes when shot down, so it could really sit up there and rain death for a very long time - even until the round is over if it isn't stopped  sounds like your average bf gif Based on a true story. "Sorry Fritz, gotta fly!" Then he pulls up, ejects, fires RPG at jet behind him, it destroys the jet, but not before the pilot ejects as well, so he switches to his sniper and headshots him in the air, wait a minute the jet did a full loop, he gets back in the jet. Now the gif can end Good thing everybody follows all the rules of war!  But were parachuting soldiers allowed to fire on enemies below?    Parachuting *pilots who have ejected

Shooting paratroopers as they come down is still legal You fuckin legend The real joke is always in the comments. Real MvP. Why the fuck do you not have over 9000 upvotes? I don't often login just to upvote something. But when I do.... If anything ever deserved Reddit gold that was it sir  > "Why would he come back now?"

"Because it's not likely any of the other 30 people on this team are gonna recapture Objective Butter" You my friend are my favorite person on Reddit. Oh my fucking word you beautiful human being  You sir, have won the internet for the day.  Bravo. This doesn't have nearly enough appreciation it should I'm fucking dying. Bless your soul This is one of the funniest videos that I have ever seen. Thank you. You're a good man Jason that's Jesus Christ Bourne
 You commented when it was 15 minutes old I see amazing BF1 vids all the time on Reddit. Maybe it's time to just break down and buy the game. Be a part of the madness! http://imgur.com/a/tVLcs [deleted] He probably just died from the flames, nothing badass happened or it would have been in the video  I posted this a couple days ago!

https://m.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/5dpg0u/killed_in_action_from_riding_exploding_behemoth/ My glasses! Also it looks badass Yes Yes, but parachutes take longer to deploy to prevent parachute spamming from pevious battlefields where you would jump off a one story building and hit the parachute button to prevent damage. Ao depending on the height ot might be better to try to wait it out. Also sometimes the zepplin falls at an angle so running off the side would just put you in the way of it 5 million Karma is a ton from one post *ding!* wait, you're not OP No its not, in OP's gif the game mode is Operations whereas your's is Conquest. In your life? I miss it. Apparently you can play it for free somewhere and the servers are pretty active.  Nah, it was the choppers blaring the Ride of the Valkyries for me.  Sabotaging vehicles in that game was the best. Invisibility cloak behind enemy lines, hide RDX in the back of a jeep, wait for a poor sap to jump in, wait for them to drive out of the base then... boom! I got a whole squad like that once. I hate that vehicles don't spawn in bases now.  Using the demo bombs to blast up into the air and get in ships :( RIP Well...it is a decade old. I honestly didn't think it was as bad as alot of people said it was. son of a bitch! I miss that show =( Ha cha cha cha cha! Delicious. BEEF! PORK! CHICKEN! It's an autogyro. A hybrid between a helicopter and a plane. So yes, technically they could do a slow moving hover.  It is a helicopter plane. That was bloody marvelous. No this was me Clearly not a cool guy. cheers, much learned now It took the British a while to learn what to do about them. They were so massive pilots would empty DRUMS of ammo into them and it wouldn't do jack shit. This is, I believe, how incindierary rounds were invented. It took the first pilot to down one (William Leefe Robinson) three drums of special incindierary ammo to down the first zeppelin. The British perfected it and soon enough the zeppelins couldn't even cross the channel. The story of the guy who shot down the first zeppelin is actually one of the most insane, badass things I've read. He was a HERO in England and died later in the war. 

Edit: [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leefe_Robinson) is his Wikipedia page, one of the most interesting I've read. 

I suggest reading the "celebrity" section on it, its shows how terrified people were of the airships and how huge of a deal it was that he managed to singlehandedly take one down. 

For some more general information on him: He was grounded after a crash because of how huge a celebrity he was and they couldn't risk losing him for national morale, but he kept begging to be sent back into active service. He went back and got shot down by Germans, survived, was captured and made several escape attempts. He returned to England in December and was fortunately able to spend Christmas with family before dying December 31st from the Spanish Flu. QUITE the life.  Sometimes I feel like every single thing that happened in the history of aviation is a super cool story. Thx for the info A Redditor stealing content! Now I've heard it all. Probably not, it's an artillery truck aiming at him, not a sniper. Prolly the best clip I've seen so far.  If you send them the link it should work. I had to leave it unlisted as it would confuse my subscribers, this is my normal type of video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub6mA2m3rq4  Are we doing phrasing still? Because if we are, somebody say so r/nocontext Is there sword fighting in that film then? And by sword fighting I mean...  Shiva Blasting just watched dark city earlier. def swoon worthy >And staring at a Jennifer Connelly also never gets old. /swoon

FTFY

Not trying to be an asshole, it's just *goddam* she's a pretty lady. I was thinking more like: fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck  "WITNESS MEEEEEEE!!!!!" Beemans  Ha. I told my barber I wanted something new recently, tried to describe what I was thinking of. He responded with "So, you want The Rocketeer look?"

I was very happy with the result. I loved the Rocketeer and the Art Deco feel of it. Also, the theme song by James Horner (RIP): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXbL0iukdCo

Edit: Oh and Jennifer Connelly looking hot. It was just ahead of its time. 20 years later, the same director made another movie with the same basic premise (mid-century super hero fighting nazis of dubious historical accuracy) that makes 5 times as much at the box office, and gets 2 sequels.  I love the Rocketeer. Great movie, really captures the "feel" of the time period too. 

It's not at all surprising to know that Joe Johnston (the director) was also behind Captain America: The First Avenger.  I loved this movie AND the insanely difficult NES game that came along after. First movie I ever saw in theatres. On the walk home all I could think about was watching it again. As soon as the VHS was released I had my dad rent it. No joke, I think I watched that VHS 5 times before we had to return it the next day. As in pushing into late fee territory.

Then it just kind of faded away, sadly.  I have great respect for it! Timothy Dalton plays a great bad guy.  The music cut is specifically a record scratch. "shhhhhhiiiittt. Did I leave the stove on?" ..."Lust for Life" resumes. "Well, it all started three weeks ago when..."

*VHS rewinding* "yup, that's me." "When Mum and Dad put me on that plane to visit my cousins in England, they told me, 'Son, you're special, you were born to do great things.'" You dig a hole, put in the dirt, and then cover it with dirt. In six months you return and dig up your dirt. Dirt farmer here! AMA! There were enough artillery shells to make the "sky falling" a thing though And that is why the thermobaric bomb is the most terrifying weapon in modern war. You might survive the initial strike, but that blast is going to form a vacuum so strong it pulls your lungs out your mouth.  I love breathing fire I love defending that point.  I just set down an ammo crate and packs and spam incendiary grenades at a doorway in between LMG spam . It is such a better gimmick than the BF4 Levolutions.  I thought at first I'd hate the behemoths but they haven't gotten old yet.  They feel balanced enough for the most part. You forgot the random piece of debris that touches your plane wing then causes you to hurdle towards the ground at 500000mph Well, if you don't, you'll get a strongly worded letter from The League of Nations sent to your house While many of the rules of war are regularly broken, this one is typically respected.

bjb7621 typed it wrong though, shooting parachuting soldiers is totally allowed and not frowned upon. [Shooting parachutists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_parachutists) (pilots,  airmen, passengers evacuating a damaged aircraft) was not only banned but thought of as reprehensible by pilots of both sides in WWII and beyond. War? War never changes.
 The Geneva article only provides protection to crews ejecting from doomed aircraft. Upon leaving their aircraft, they are considered non-combatants and it is a war crime to fire on them. If they open fire while descending, however, they void their protection. 

Paratroopers, on the other hand, are not protected by the Geneva article, and are legitimate targets even while descending.  Well man I haven't laughed this hard In a long time holy hell that's perfect. And to think its some random ass bf1 player that doesn't know what he's created That's why we read the comments isn't it? Jesus Jason that's Christ Bourne It's pretty fun once you get a few levels under your belt. Until then you're getting mauled by shot guns and Russian snipers.  Its totally worth it. Ive already put more hours into it than I did for BF4^^^^help ^^^^me ^^^^I ^^^^need ^^^^a ^^^^life Is that *Caboose* up there!? You know what is bad ass? Wearing  a helmet BROOOO! THIS SHIT IS AWESOMEE! Shoulda jumped my dude. "Suicide is badass!" I haven't played Battlefield in a very long time. During the beta I hammered the 9 key. Wait, you just replied to yourself! A master at work Just a repost away, don't let your dreams be dreams. I won't lie -- it's not my vid, I just saw the gif in the web, on Russian network VK so I just posted it here for you guys. If someone knows how it ends and whether the sniper makes the shot or not -- please do tell! It was a joke, sorry.  I assumed we all had some Zeppelin reels. 300-400 peeps Im sorry, but swooping down in an F4 Phantom and Napalming half the enemy team has gotta be the best thing ever from BF:V SSHHEEIILLAA!! MADRE DE DIOS!
 Probably the only cartoon based on an actor that actually worked. Me too dude..... you want the mustache on or off? hey its you your me It is, check out the air force museum in Dayton Ohio if you get a chance, everything from Wright brothers to Saturn rockets all lined up. It's fantastic. Only thing it is missing is a dirigible, not a single rigid frame blimp on display anywhere in the world that I know of. I would drive so very far to see one. Can't even find a blimp on display anywhere. I've seen a dragon fly. I've seen a horse fly. Heck, I've even seen a house fly. But I be done seen bout everything when I see a redditor lie. "stealing content"

Do you know what reddit actually is? At least he didn't steal it from reddit Easy the best clip ever created. WELL THEN, that is quite different.
Edit: You certainly earned my sub. Oh man, you're the toilet paper machine guy! Those were great! Do you browse /r/shittyrobots by chance? You. I like you. I don't normally subscribe. Subscribed. Phrasing! First! Boom!  /r/evenwithcontext There's a lil swashbuckling for sho  [deleted] I think you mean HNNNGHHHH! worthy.
 No, I'm pretty sure that by the time the clip starts, it's already on to "FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKK!!!!" "I want like a dome on top with a vertical fin sticking out the back.  Oh, and cut the front so my face looks like it's made of metal." [removed] I like your barber. I always knew that hairstyle as "The Brendan Fraser" I miss Horner; I loved his music. I had a bad wee recently, but the sound track to "sneakers" ; specially the scene where Marty and Cosmo encounter each other, mellowed me back out. So many awesome scores 

 SO HOT.   45 and still flaming. I wonder why she isn't in as many movies lately, she's a great actress. That is one of the greatest hero themes ever, the kind they refuse to write anymore. I remember that for a couple years after the movie bombed, many ads and movie trailers recycled this music.  Brb, going to watch the rocketeer Don't underestimate the power of a successful comic book franchise either. If he'd made the same movie 20 years ago starring a superhero that was a household name, it might have gotten 2 sequels as well.   For the old, ignorant redditor who loved Rocketman but doesn't remember the director, what movie are we talking about here? I couldn't even pass the first level. I believe it was the plane racing. It was just flying in loops and I couldn't figure that shit out. *It all started when I get sick and tired of Zip pushing me around* "Everybody hates Christoph" >phonograph scratch [relevant XKCD](http://xkcd.com/1745). *Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right! Here I am! Stuck in the middle with you...* [deleted] *Rewinds too far* Woops did not mean for you to see that Dennis there's some lovely filth down here! Better get a cat to do that for you That's brilliant. Unlimited dirt!  How do you replenish your dirt supply after it's been harvested? How do you farm dirt?  How does one extract the dirt from the earth? Yeah but we're all gonna look metal as fuck when it happens.  How?  I thought you can't get a stronger vacuum than zero atmospheres.  In most cases you have like a one atmosphere pressure differential, which isn't very much.

Anyway, wouldn't a high pressure differential burst your lungs?  I don't think your lungs are gonna get sucked out through your mouth.

edit: 

>The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique–and unpleasant.... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs.... 

The blast wave actually increases the pressure in the lungs, and then once you release all the pressure on the outside, the gas expands proportionally.  then your lungs pop like a balloon. The most terrifying? What about everyone getting shot in the dick? I just spent a lot of time learning about thermobaric bombs and their use in Syria because of your post. It's goddamn sobering how fucked up people can really be. that's some kinky shit Did you happen to read World War Z? I love assaulting that point. Every time I die I get to try something new to break through. It is an amazing gimmick imho.  
I always stop and watch it fall till someone comes and kill me. Perfect bayonet charge into the guy recording.  Or the lag comp bounces you back out of the cockpit a full second later and you land outside ground battlefield. Within seconds your god of choice executes you for desertion. "Then the league of nations said 'No, if you're in the league of nations you're not supposed to take over the world'. And Japan said, 'How about I do, any way!'". War? War has changed How do you tell the difference if you don't see the plane? There was that one american pilot dude who was the only guy to shoot down a japanese zero with a handgun while parachuting iirc. I'll see if I can find a source

EDIT: The dude was [Owen J. Baggett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_J._Baggett#Military_service) and he did shoot down a Zero with a M1911 He needs to do an AMA. TBH i actually don't know what game this is. That and to be told that the headline/article is bullshit, or that the cute animal in a seemingly harmless situation is actually in grave peril. Can you imagine reddit without a comment section? Jesus Jesus, Jason! That's Christ Bourne! /r/me_irl



I can only play it like once a week (my fiancée has it). I switch between scout and medic depending on the map and the whole time I just go around trying to pick up good guns lol Same.  I got a COD after BF4 and never really looked back but this time I haven't gotten the newest COD and the only reason I would is to play MW4 again... Good ol' RvB. I'm hoping the latest season gets better. I'm like 4 episodes in and I'm not super impressed. It's like they rebooted their ability to tell a story, too. RIP County Mac NOTHING IS MORE BADASS THAN TREATING A WOMAN WITH RESPECT! [deleted] Great, now I have a weird version of the MASH theme song stuck in my head! RIP Country Mac What does the 9 key do? the other one is /u/pro_redditor A Redditor stealing content! Now I've heard it all.
 REALLY WHAT? 

Edit: Probably should add some more to this, BF2142 was one of my all time favourite games I would love to play it again in a full server could you please expand upon your comment and let me know where & how I can play 2142 again? :) You shot Church, you team-killing fucktard! Kittens.... with spikes! Dude! I knew you could pick up chicks in that tank! *Too bad.* Hey me! It's your you. Being there for the origin of this meme/joke, this will never get old to me.  It's come so far. Living in Europe, so....

But to be honest I always like the stories more than seeing the actual object. 
I guess I'm more of a theoretical guy than an engineer. A horse of autistic computer nerds whose highest values are plagiarism and job security? Sorry for the dumb question but what is this clip? I haven't seen the Rocketeer since it was in theatres and there's obviously video game footage interspersed... Lol mine too  Thanks glad you liked them!  All the time. My toilet paper machine is actually listed as banned on the sidebar for being posted too often. I checkout everyone's shitty robots :)  Inapropes.... Requiem for a Dream? Really nailed the ass-to-ass! You get me. Say no more fam #Cokeforoursolders! im with you brother! #MakeWarFunAgain! Gimme something in between the Rocketeer and Brendan Fraser in The Mummy.  >a bad wee  
  
I'm so sorry Titties poppin  WANT TO TOUCH THE HINEY [riding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK1wR0pB12M) Cause she did that shitty horror movie with all the water I had the exact same experience. I found out later that you were supposed to alternate pressing left, right, left, right quickly to make the plane go faster but there was no indication that that's what you were supposed to do. Ahh, the good old days when you were expected to read a manual or just figure things out on your own. A blessing and a curse. Literally exact same experience.

Balled my eyes out until my dad came down and asked me what was wrong, and told him it was too hard.

Took me and the cartridge back to Hollywood Video, and nudged me up to the counter where I was still crying saying it was too hard. and asked if I could "Get another game instead". Employee sort of gave the impression that they don't really do that, but felt bad because I was like 5 years old.

Got a different game..

Have been playing and loving the "Lemmings" vidoe games ever since. But wait a second I'm getting ahead of myself, let's rewind a bit.

*1980s feel good pop song plays* Fill your own goddamn sandbags! [>TFW the missus sends you out for tea and biscuits and you end up on the front-lines again.](http://i.imgur.com/rRC75S1.jpg) *Fast-forwards for a sec*

"Ah, there we go." Excuse me, old woman.  That's when the cat starts going on your bed.  
  
Get a cat to do anything. Who do you think you are? You head on down to the Sipsco dirt factory of course.

Big money, big women, big fun. I personally use a Hitachi EX8000-6. I like it for the large loads. With a shovel. Many different ways for different levels of dirt farmers.

To begin I recommend hands, once your proficiency reaches level 5 then you can advance to the shovel. Once you reach a character level of ~16 you can start using tractors. There are many differrnt types of tractors depending on your sub class of dirt farmer! But who will survive to paint the album cover? [Also cool guys don't look at explosions and are totally immune to fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqz5dbs5zmo) I think i would rather be shot in the dick an bleed to death than have my lungs pulled out of my mouth and suffocate.  Several years ago... Forgive me if I am not seeing the connection  Rifle grenades.... All of the rifle grenades ever.  Like this?

https://m.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/5dsrrr/bf1_villain_in_the_mist_always_watching/ Zamorak is a cruel master... I like to think my god of choice would have executed me for not dying on that burning zeppelin, like a true hero. Well everyone else already did! "Can you call us something else, other than dipshit?"

"How about *sunrise land*" This war seems familiar... Paratroopers usually descended in mass numbers, while an air crew would be only 2-15 men usually. Not only that, but it's unlikely that paratroopers would be descending in the middle of a dogfight/flak field. The soldiers on the ground would likely see the air battle going on above or at least know of it and could infer that the airmen descending were from downed aircraft.  I'm amazed they made a parachute big enough to hold the weight of his giant balls. The new Ken Bone. I'm talking about the guy running on the blimp, he doesn't know how heroic he is its just normal shit to him prob 
 Jesus Christ is Bourne again Jason! Suicide is bad ass

Just aim for center of mass

And splatter your insides against the wall It displays the number 9, as seen here: 9 It was the parachute button in older games. Am I having a seizure? This is some next level Karma Whoring right here, it's a privilege to see a master in action. Wait, then who are you? Damn son you don't skip a beat. I - but - your - yes.  I've seen a dragon fly. I've seen a horse fly. Heck, I've even seen a house fly. But I be done seen bout everything when I see a redditor lie.
 BF2142 and BF2 Revive, one character for both games. Comes with installer for both games.  Oh my god. I'm the team-killing fucktard! I have remembered this quote since the day it was originally released.  Cracks me up every time!

*Hey*

*You ever wonder why we're here?*

*It's one of life's great mysteries isn't it? Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence? Is there really a God, you know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don't know man... but it keeps me up at night.*

No this is patrick The video game footage of the guy running on the blimp as it's exploding made the front page today as its own video and now it looks like the scene from The Rocketeer was recreated using some of the video game footage.  It's just a cool video.  Nothing more.  I think you folks that do these ironic shitty robots are really inspiring. I think a big barrier to people starting their own projects is coming up with that one project that is supposed to be useful in some way and it can be intimidating and paralyzing. It's too serious and intense.


This technique of building robots shows people that you can still be artistic, funny, and lighthearted while still learning how to build things can really take that intimidating edge off the learning process for beginners.


 Ah, you want the Jerry O'Connell! Lol, sorry ! That was supposed to say "a bad week". In my defense, I was on mobile and on the 250 express bus! peak titties.

Most of the games I got from blockbuster or Hollywood video didn't have manuals :( it was baptism by fire  The song is Walking on Sunshine by Katrina and the Waves. But it's WWI? Every night, me and the boys would head down to "One Pin Short", this run down bowling alley alley ran by this Ukrainian with a fat gut and a wife beater. Me, Tim, and the Frederick Twins would go right before closing time and hide till the old comrade shut everything down and went home. 

It was our own personal club every night. Tim got some quarters from his parents rainy day jar and we'd have free reign of the jukebox. One of the twins worked there during the day, so he knew how to work everything allowing us to enjoy glow bowl at our leisure. Sometimes we played cards, smoked and drank, other times we'd invite some of the girls from the Catholic school but no matter what it was a good time.

Or even better yet, check out the audio book. It was absolutely amazing. The book is a series of interviews, so it lends itself to the audio book format perfectly. They even got different voice actors for different interviews.

I don't get it. It drives me insane.  Soldier no. SOLIDER YES! SOLDIER, NO! **SOLDIER YES!!** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos you got more of them pixels? https://i.gyazo.com/041dc1ad8f2cbe19d49a4449a3f6fc5a.png I love how he turns away at the end I can end you right here, you little shit. Is that an enemy tank? It's a little hard to see. It's funny however. I love moments of this in Battlefield. It actually reminds me of the Christmas Truce during World War 1.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce I've seen higher quality Gifs in 2004 How the fuck did you get such terrible quality from a brand new game. The mind boggles. I love the "Let's be friends!" via shaking heads and rapidly jumping.
 More air got blown out of my nose then usual. when was battlefield released for the original nes No! DON'T TOUCH THAT! If I had a dollar for every pixel in this video, I would have 76 cents [Wow hey! Don't touch me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyUnSuYYs18) Soldier: Imma hit it!

Tank: Don't you do it!

Soldier: IMMA DO IT!

Tank: DON'T YOU DO IT! I laughed at this more that I thought I would. This looks like it has some sort of filter to make the game look like an oil on canvas that somebody left outside on a foggy day by accident.  [Hey. Stop it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8reIa71Bpw) - Recorded with my Verizon Chocolate Touch Like a toddler temper tantrum Which pixel is the tank? My favorite thing to do in this game is standing on top of a landship and hammer it with a wrench, and since they can't aim up they are forced to walk out of the vehicle to defend it or they'll explode.

This works for approximately 5 seconds and then you're shot by one of the 20 enemy snipers. You told me to. I have done nothing but teleport bread for three days.  Contender for worst quality gif in history That's hilarious Reminds me of one of those constantly pissed off teachers who just looks down at you from the teachers desk, shaking their head in disappointment. is this 1p resolution Battlefield 1 looks great! Turn up the jpegs pretty funny but I was still able to see something in this gif, could you maybe lower the quality a little? Don't make me blast you, man. Oh no... Oh yes... This shit, i love this shit. [PLEASE DON'T](https://gfycat.com/ShockedIllinformedBug) The quality is so bad, I genuinely thought this was from battlefield heroes. Canadian forces? So your hitting your own tank?   what does this help? Would have been good if it wasn't recorded with a 2001 flipphone. i thought this was a ps1 game at first and i was trying to figure out what game. but then i realized... Damn is this what the PS4Pro looks like? Did you record this on VHS by chance? r I believe I've never seen a gif with such low quality as this. Recorded with the worlds finest potato. I love watching gameplay of BF1 and I have no intention on buying it I can count the pixel in this gif "No! Bad Ottoman!" I wanted the tank to fire. What is this? Battlefield Potato cam. I'd love to upvote this, too bad you don't have the game in the title  :( I didn't know a tank could be cute! No - Yes!!! - Nooo! You need to start recording with a better potato.  HIT THE OBVIOUS WEAK SPOT!!!!!! I laughed;  a lot.


I'm at work.

Good thing I'm the only one on this floor over the weekend. I snorted. I couldn't stop laughing lol, don't know why I found this so funny. Thanks OP! :) Recorded on a potato? In a game? this entire post just made my day  The quality is so poor I thought this was Battlefield 1942 If you're going to steal someone's video, at least steal it the correct way lol  The amount of "puckering up" his butthole did when the head of the tank turned around is probably hilarious on it own but that was just gold man  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos [deleted] https://gfycat.com/ShockedIllinformedBug no.no. you stop that.

ok. I never thought that someone could make a gif look like a jpg, but somehow op, you managed it. Anyone else see the crocodile mouth at the tail of the tank? I can't unsee it now.  If that was me I would have been killed instantly He's not mad, he's just disappointed. Came to comments section expecting 99% to be about the quality of the gif. Was not disappointed.  One of my favorite moments was when I was in a squad with randoms and we were doing amazing at silent teamwork. As we were moving to the next objective we came across a heavy tank with no side gunners. None of us had explosives so we climbed on top and started to beat the tank with our melee weapons. ...want to get blown up?  
...because that's how you get blown up... This would be 10x funnier if it didn't look like it was recorded during WWI. This made me laugh harder than I expected. No! You do not get to blow me up. Good day sir.

I said good day! Set GFX to potato for that authentic underwater-without-googles-getting-chlorine-in-the-eyes effect 10/10 too funny  Battlefield at its best. TIL that WWI was pretty damn adorable. I love these fucking videos xD.  No! Yes! No! Yes! [not today, pal](http://imgur.com/gallery/eJSwK) Just because the game is set in WW1 doesn't mean your gif has to be too  This was actually filmed during WW1 judging from the quality I see you used the ww1 camera to fit the apnosphere. I laughed way too hard at this
 This really needs to be upvoted. Thanks for finding it! higher please go you Now we know why the quality was turds. Thanks, this is better than the 24x24 resolution gif that the OP uploaded. Downvoting OP for potato and upvoting you instead Looks 1,000x better See,  this should be the top submission,  nevermind the top comment that it. Soon will be StankyShaft.  [NOW WITH A BETTER GIF](https://gfycat.com/IncomparablePerkyKatydid) the video has been ripped so many damn times it looks like shit now lol Thats incredible, so much better than the gif. Particularly with the sound.
 Close. OP had a nylon stocking over his head at the time.  That's because this is real found footage from WW1. A prototype camera that films in color! Nah it's just on a console. That's what it looks like. Somehow it looks better on imgur instead of embedded here.  I think reddit stretched it a bit, causing additional artifacting or something.  The source is still low-res, but it doesn't have those dots at least. This nearly made me rage quit my ISP. #SayNoToPotatoes Op recorded this with the I-potato. his pc could only download and repost the gif in 240p http://i.imgur.com/TeI03gL.gifv I feel like I could literally watch that all day these are amazing lol Is there a subreddit for these? [For that WW1 feel.](https://gfycat.com/AlertPerfumedAmurminnow) I feel like I've poured soup into my eyes OP has a starch addiction.  He needed external hardware to capture all 30 polygons at once.  Its been badly ripped off of the original source. I have seen this clip in hd.  What's a potato?  It makes it look more cinematic  I'm pretty sure it was just shot in p... That's what I was thinking >.<
Why share in HD when you can share a grainy Nokia recording? Its the GIF quality too you dildo Wait, this is B1? I thought it was an N64 game. Jesus OP, get your shit together. I teleported bread.

French actually, the tank in the gif is a Renault FT, developed by the French and widely used by many of the allied powers during ww1, the insignia on the tank is used by the French for armoured vechicles. It increases the tank's velocity by small increments, overtime though this adds up. Check the top and the roundel. Crash Bandicoot Racing Battlefield 1 Dark souls 3 [It's not](http://odditymall.com/includes/content/upload/cat-tank-playhouse-1569.jpg) WW1 had better quality then that potato  You're welcome!

I jumped away and her team never even knew I was there.  Reminds me of knife fights in cs. You'd swish your knife out and stab the air. If the other was not craven, you got yourself a good, clean knife fight. Rare, but fun :D Is this a shooters thing? Reminds me of that scene in Fury Somebody should add this to the wiggling compilation gif, the one with Shaq and the pouncing kitty. /r/gamersbeingbros was just started as a result of this thread Where did you get this real footage? Significantly better than actual footage I have seen from the era.   Footage of an unnamed war hero bravely defending his battalion from tank fire.

[This is actually one of the oldest gifs from my meme folder, 2006](http://imgur.com/a/UrXA8) [this is one of my favorites from years ago](http://i.imgur.com/J2Qs6.png) Possible answer: their internet connection is shit and thus would make a full-quality or even decent-quality video take far too long to reasonably upload, so they compressed the shit out of it to remedy that issue. Believe me, it's possible (my internet is garbage--0.8 Mbps up *if I'm lucky* and have zero download utilization). OP stole the video.

Tank you Noooo the gif cuts off the part where the terrorist drops a smoke so the CT can ninja-defuse!  I picture the same tank driving doing all of these This is why I love Overwatch This shit taught kids about honor back in the days. If someone swishes his knife, you either swish yours to confirm the duel, or fire a round to deny the challenge. Such are the rules. CSGO. It was down to 1v1, me and the CT's last guy. I pulled my knife and swished.... Then heard him do it across the map. Shit was on. We found each other and we're strafing and trying to slash each other for a solid minute. Then he pulled his gun and killed me and won for his team. I don't like csgo.  In the original Gears of War, people would signal to each other from across the map that they wanted to have a good clean shotgun fight, no lancers or pistols.  i remember you had to stab at the walls to let them hear the knife so that they knew it was time for a knife fight.  Ah I miss these days of gamer integrity. Almost forgot about the good ole CS knife fights I have an irrational love for the word craven. I think you will find this behavior in most games that have no means of communication between teams. That is one of the few understandable actions you can do to get your point across. OP's is just colourized and sharpened.  I hit ctl-z twice. OP is a time traveler https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSwGT_-WrhE the renault ft was made from 1917-1949. It was the past. If anything there were more pixels around because we hadn't yet started using them all up. That's why old games look pixely. But now we're starting to run out of this natural resource. In twenty years we won't be able to blur out anyone's face for their protection. They'll be forced to wear a bit of frosted glass over their head. Rape Horse? http://coub.com/view/gh5as

And let us make presents out of brass and stuff. Just let the fighting end for a week or two. "BF1 Christmas event!  For one week, the game will be updated to become Rocket League." Battlefield 1 becomes FIFA 17 for a day You turn on BF1 and you are redirected to the FIFA 17 main menu. The twist is that France is not a playable team.  Doughboys ain't gonna like that. "Of course I remember it, I was *never* offside, that was an appalling decision..." Yeah I've heard of Verdun. Didn't know they did that though. Here's hoping we get something cool as well.

You should expect it by now.  I don't know what I expected, especially with the comment he replied to. Fuck now I need to comb thorough all of Reddit just to find a more appropriate use of that just to make u eat ur hat. See u in 64 years.

Welp, he's not a threat  *Embrace Tranquility* LOL. It's awesome how he just looks back at his team like, "Uh, guys? Shit they're gone..." Aren't you that guy who fucks cats or something? Can someone explain to me why you wouldn't just kill these guys?

Edit: Okay guys I get it. I was just thinking there was more to it then that. Please don't kill me. What game is that? this is easy to do. i once got all random people to stop fighting and chill on the objective the whole game

edit: https://youtu.be/IG5KsOpTobw?t=1m38s sometimes Extra karma. They save gifs like these for multiplayer game threads but you also have the meis and mccrees who shoot my tracer in the face during skirmish after first sitting around emoting and helloing for a minute.

those fuckers. >This is why I love gaming in general, such as TF2

FTFY My last skirmish, I was a Bastion, just roaming around and waving hello to the enemy. A Genji came up to me and started saying hello, but everytime I looked away, he would melee me and say hello again. So after a few times I got a little fed up and changed to turret form and he backed away, but I waved the little self healing arm at him and he came back. I started turning away and he moved forward to hit me and I spun and unloaded about 300 dps in his face. It was beautiful  It is known. And if you had no honor, you were TKed next round.  These are the rules of the duel? I remember in smash brothers we would taunt to show we were ready if we were done practicing or trying out a new combo. It was on after that taunt. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/bDW7DCG I think you forgot this.

>Get rekt noob! "NO HONOR" I did something similar once. It was down to 1v1 in a medieval CS-like game (M&B:Warband). I asked the guy in chat where he was from and while he was typing I threw a javelin in his face. Felt bad, but couldn't stop laughing. Ugh, I LOVED shotgun fights in the original GoW. There was an art to the roll and blast. They nerfed it in the second one, and I havent played any of them since to see if it's improved.  all i remember is getting stunned for 2 full seconds while swinging out in the open trying to signal them One shot stir fry was my favourite weapon too to play with. There was a old map with an Aztec temple and there was a two story room surrounded in pillars.  Everyone would sit on the second level...  Swoosh knife to declare a challenge,  then those two would jump into the pit and fight to the death as everyone watched. 

Some of the most fun I've had.  That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about video editing to dispute you.  You... you're one of those funny guys my mother warned me about, aren't you? From the past How the fuck did he get past the librarian to get the amulet? They have strict rules against using magic in the library This footage is from Wings (1927). It depicts the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and used over 3500 extras.

Edit: misspell  My lord this is crazy If this is real, it's the best WWI footage I've ever seen. No silly, [Casca.](http://fullhdpictures.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Potato.jpg) There's more... Maybe Brass snowballs. Happy now? I just got played twice in a row God damnit I need to reevaluate my life. I thought "maybe this will be different, maybe it'll actually be a gif from '04". Nope. I got ruined again Too fucking much for 1.5 Mbps down. Was paying around $35/month, but that pricing has since ended and it seems it's now up to $44/month. Unfortunately the wiring in my damned apartment is too garbage to do much better, and this is the cheapest pricing available here. I would have blasted you. I'm not magical. I came here to talk Battlefield. I didn't expect some kind of Spanish Inquisition.  I still don't know what it is. I expected it, but still clicked. Damn myself.  RemindMe! 64 years  Found it!!

I mean, he could have saved his team by shooting the guy, but the dude got into a position to watch *at least three guys* walk by obliviously so yeah, maybe he deserves this gimme. See, I thought he was a goat fucker too. But I had him tagged. Now I don't. So... this may be a different guy.

*But he has so much karma* Because they asked them not to. Cause they're having fun with each other? It would be terribly impolite. Because it's a nice experience to have shared with another player. Because they're being peaceful and just wave at you? I think our explanations would be wasted on you, evil one. I think it's just a gesture of good sportsmanship. Most of these people are in no position to fight back, so it's just to be friendly.  Cuz it's funny not to Asking that question already makes you unworthy.

What are you? Some kind of rape-murder? What kind of sick fuck kills someone without their consent. Because chivalry is not dead. There's something magical to the sudden break in the mindless shooting to realize that there's another person on the other end. Also, like the Borg not bothering with someone that isn't really a threat -- not worth the ammo or being a dick. Sad! Overwatch They save *relevance* to add more relevance to the thread.

I appreciate it. Better than seeing .gifs fractured all over the place. Then you want to make them pay. You put your mlg face on and go out. You take your first perfect shot... they found a game and disappeared. Fuck These are the ways of the dothraki. It is known.  At the first 0.05 seconds of next round. Yeah. Break a deal, face the wheel. If you hit me in an opening round taunt, I will do everything in my pathetic skill range to demoralise, humiliate and *destroy* you. Apparently Harrison Ford was really ill during that scene, and he and Spielberg just agreed that he should "just shoot the son of a bitch".

He told that story on his Reddit AMA actually... That scene has a funny backstory. They were supposed to have this awesome fight scene between Indy with his whip and the guy with the sword. Harrison Ford was very sick the day the scene was supposed to be shot and suggested Indy just shooting the guy instead. what an ass I just described this scene to OP without realizing it's what you posted.

I read that Ford was feeling sick that day and didn't want to do the whole scene. and also the 'Cyka idiot why knif omg noob retard Blyat'

FTFY ...You're a monster. You bastard Seriously.  That shit was the best part of the game.  They somewhat brought it back by Gears 3 after everyone kept complaining (haven't played the 4th) but it was never the same, especially after they made the lancer bullets stop you in your fucking tracks. Taking away the ability to shoot/roll simultaneously killed the franchise for me. The online in GoW2 was terrible, GoW3 was an improvement and still pretty fun, and then Judgment was legitimately one of the worst games I've ever bought. I traded it in for Halo 4 after two weeks. He's lying. Open the gif in a new window and hit alt+F4 to see.  Amateur video editor here, I can assure you that's how it works.

Oh am I :D I should have read this and known, ***known***! http://i.imgur.com/o536nVm.gifv I pay for 50mbps down, but actually get around 34. I pay $45 a month lol Remember that opening cinematic where the two guys don't shoot eachother? It's kind of like that.   I suck so bad I'll grab any chance to improve my stats In Overwatch apparently there is an unwritten rule that if someone from the other team comes over and emotes, you don't kill them. I always kill them. *NOBODY EXPECTS [THE SPANISH INQUISITION!](https://youtu.be/7WJXHY2OXGE?t=36)* It's sad that you'll be dead 13 years before this goes off :< God. Dammit. Have to ask, did you copy a legit URL for that or did you just make it up? I'm strangely disappointed that this isn't a thing. 

Edit: Now they've gone and done it!  In Planetside 2, me and one guy from the other team were capping the same location. We probably capped the place about 5 times each, back to back. I was cloaked the whole time but I started to feel that we had an understanding. When I intentionally revealed my self right in front of him, he killed me.

We had something going there, but he blew it. So disappoointed :(  /r/canadiansgaming include me in the screencap

Edit: nevermind, [made my own](http://imgur.com/89KI3w3) I'm glad that this is a thing You basically created a sub. Hahaha, that's awesome That anus is heinous. /r/wehaveseenthebutthole Don't kill me pls I play video games and Magic: The Gathering.

Sometimes it's more fun to leave the guy who's derping around so he can learn how to play properly. Sometimes it's *easier* to kill them instantly, but then the fun is one-sided. Impolite IKR?! If you kill the dude with the pea-shooter he'll just respawn at the start again and the whole trek would be wasted.

I once didn't shoot someone in the face during a game of r/Outside paintball and they took the flag. I mean, would *you* shoot someone 10ft away if only their face was showing?

(Yeah, me too, i shot that guy in the face...) Does your username work? lolol Like the tryhard Symmetras in Skirmish.  Sometimes fractured .gifs are [relevant](https://gfycat.com/ClutteredShamelessCob) hold me. Kind of shitty. That wasn't even a random guy they cut. Apparently he had trained for it for months. Also Steve Buscemi was a K9 firefighter on 9/11 after Seth Macfarlane accidentally missed his flight.  Which is funny, because I really feel like that scene did a good job of definiting Indy's personality. Something something dysentery. I honestly thought Gears 3 had much better multiplayer than 1 or 2. It was the first one I could actually play for hours/routinely like a CoD/Halo and still felt fun. *new tab This trick only works if you delete your system32 folder first though.

[This footage is from the wing (1963)](https://youtu.be/dar2HKImK-0?t=20s) It features a gremlin on the wing. 4:45 minute mark...  Start there...  Actually pretty funny dialog.  > using tons of coloured footage from WW1

WW1 in color? even better, lets shoot snowballs from cannons and move them!

Oh wait thats a tank I'd happily trade up for that! So you're the son of a bitch that kills me when I'm just trying to dab with genji. It comes from TF2. Please don't kill them. If you wanna go full serious, just say hello and then walk away ignoring them. Some people just want to have some different fun once in a while. In skirmish at the very least.  Oh, so you're that asshole. I thought this was going to be the Rick Roll video. The Inquisition, what a show, the Inquisition, here we go, we know you're wishing that we'd go awaaaaaay

But the Inquisition's here and it's here to [staaaaaaay](https://youtu.be/LnF1OtP2Svk) Put her in...

I like sneaking up on enemy snipers and then sniping with them until they notice me. Sometimes it's pistols at dawn, and sometimes, just sometimes, you compete to see who can get the highest score while batting off derogatory comments from your own teams. ;) There is no brotherhood in that game without a harasser.

I like being roadhog, using my hook on a mercy to pull her close, then just wave at them and walk away.  Obviously does not play magic competitively.

Why won't they let me sit and wave in peace? now kiss I don't see how it's shitty.  That's probably one of the most famous movie scenes ever.  It's been shown and referenced far more than any generic action movie fight scene would have been. On the internet, nobody knows you're a K9 firefighter. K9/11 fire fighter jet fuel can't melt steel beams Wake up! Tabs are so 2016.

You NEVER and I mean NEVER kill the spy crab they're a rare and endangered species!! Rules are boring. Games are best when you break the rules. never kill a man in skirmish It's worth like 6 Rick Rolls I thought it was just gonna be Peyton Manning again. Yeah. I genuinely didn't expect it to be the Spanish Inquisition That's because NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION Im apart of history now.  Nice! When I get a pc again I'll try to salvage some old disks... I have a few (very old) WoW screenshots that will fit right in over there!

 Best I can do is 3, but I know a guy who can check it out, lemme give him a call and have him come down, if it's legit maybe we can work something out. Being apart would suggest you've been removed from history, which is quite scary. 

Are you sure you wouldn't rather be a part of history? I'm proud of you.  Tends to work a little better in Planet Side because there's 3 factions, so it's entirely possible you'll both be shooting the same people so neither of you feels obligated to protect targets. *Weapons dealers* hate *him!* Damage that is surprising? for me, this is like trying to read chinese. Lol I have no idea what you just said Could be worse. Could be Geist.  Well m'memed. Awww, no one did the 3 rapid squat customary greeting.

"I know the thing!"

"Lets do the thing!!!" [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr9DM3St0vA) Reminds me when a player and an invader do ridiculous gestures in a Dark Souls game, and then a 3rd shows up and joins in.

VERY GOOD! source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr9DM3St0vA wish this was longer lol That's more physical activity than I thought was possible at a game convention.   Is that a gamer mating ritual That woman's reaction was the best part. A perfect mix of confusion and amusement. This has to be so exhausting.  I was really hoping to see a continuing congo line.
 Hey this is at RTX! are their legs ridiculously skinny or is it just the black leggings?

edit: grammar I'd be so cashed after like 5 minutes of that.  I don't get it. I love the third guy in yellow that just seems to join in at the end That is awesome! Im hoping this continues and we get a whole line of happy dancing loons Imagine if everyone at gaming conventions walked like this Are their movements a shout out to Marlin webs video?

See this post.





Laugh with unexpected joy.




Laugh til I cry. 





Cry it all out, like sudden diarrhea of the soul. Takes like three minutes. Some of that time pushing just to be sure, as one does.

Pretty sure they are doing [this...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGX4JdtQi8) You can tell these aren't hard core gamers....a basic level of cardio gives them away https://youtu.be/PQZu5WzqDY4 Halo 6 Legendary ending leaked As a Rooster Teeth fan who went to RTX this warms my heart to see shit like this get to the front page WATERMELONE Love the girl and her looks. Wow this is a real treat. Weve stumbled upon two wild spartans performing a mating dance. Its incredibly rare to find a pair of these creatures in the wild since they are usually very secluded animals. Watch as they meet up in the middle of the area here. You can see after they get close enough, one initiates the process with a distinctive wave and the other accepts. Now they follow one another to their final mating place, or what we like to call "getting a room". We best leave them be now. Wouldnt want to disturb the process of these beautiful creatures. It has to be so akward once they stop that This is basically how I've made my friends. The guys limbs in the Chief costume look so...unnatural. The third guy that joins them absolutely slayed me. So good. "Oh boy oh boy" Looks about right. so catchy even Bumblebee has to join in. TAAAAAAKE  I'd be able to do this for maybe a minute before I get tired and have to stop. This is the most beautiful GIF I've ever seen. Is there an entire video of this pls? Master Chief on the left has some sick moves Well this is a great video to wake up to For a second I thought I was watching another Japanese robot demonstration Ooga ooga! This just made me soo happy, it's kinda adorable. I was seriously hoping for more to join in. Does this work in real life? If its better with sound, why link a gif?  Then why not just fuckin link to the video if its better with sound? The triple t-bag Ha I love Boston dynamics.

They've come a long day, I remember their earlier [big dog](http://youtu.be/cNZPRsrwumQ)  video and the [parody](http://youtu.be/mXI4WWhPn-U) someone made lol.

I can just imagine being on the battlefield and hearing 50 of those things coming my way..... God save us all lol


Edit... I'll add this in case it gives anyone a laugh. Right around the time I saw big dog (years ago) I had been searching for robots/mechs around the world and had come across this guy as well... Lol... I present to you the [Land Walker](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oVwbUljGs3g) ! Again... 50 of those would be terrifying (on a flat surface) but they're so not sneaking up on you :) http://i.imgur.com/zwYkKtF.gifv https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crg9t7NKvLo *Spartans. 

There is but one "Master Chief."  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXI4WWhPn-U Ones actually Locke, not Master Chief I clicked the gif before reading the title and actually thought this is what it was. Only one of them is. The rest don't know though.  "Zhu Li, do the thing!" [Numfar! Do the dance of joy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycFqzNxiTwY) Reminds me of that episode of Dexters lab where he makes the dog talk [And what its based on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGX4JdtQi8) Thank you for posting the sauce, the music made it infinitely better! [That source's source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PIixoqeRoM) The OG master chief is just too good at that.  i like it ! HELLLLOOO! 

5 minutes later.


I'M SORRYYYY! Praise the sun! \\[T]/ https://youtu.be/8I6fmvp37TU I was exploring in WoW once and I came across a Tauren and a Night Elf dancing at a crossroad in Mullgore, the Tauren starting place. 

I joined in, then another did, and another ,and another..... HELLLLLOOOOO Everyone wishes it was longer. Learn to be satisfied with what you have. --- my gf That's what she said It makes me tired just watching that don't underestimate a skinny nerd full of Code Red. The skinny Master Chiefs legs are in danger of snapping. It's actually RTX! A little bit different than a gaming convention  its like when dogs sniff each others booty holes except with people Sounds like an oxymoron  The best part is that was at RTX and the people in yellow shirts were the guardians volunteering there to make sure things went smoothly, she's just doing her job and bam that happens haha Confusement This girl is actually a member in an organization I'm in at my school. She wasn't a guardian last year but always told me stories about how she hung out with them. I was so jealous when I found out she was one this year!! "This is weird, but not the weirdest thing I've seen all weekend." In a hot convention with a suit on? Definitely Heavy is credit to conga line Yeah it is! I was there this year. Did you get to go? I think they must be pretty tall, and probably don't squat, or maybe the armour is thinner than it looks.  The first one is lanky as fuck. Yeah they're all tall and lanky dudes. One was my roommate and I promise he's never done a squat in his life. Probably doesn't help with the apparent size that they're wearing the costumes with large plastic armor plates. Bruh 5 mins? I'm imagining feeling like jello after 45 seconds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGX4JdtQi8

edit: corrected link to the original. Me too I like to think he's not with them, just saw them dancing and joined in.  http://i.imgur.com/zTeCKbU.gifv You're awesome! Everyone would be fit as fuck  That was the absolute best thing I've seen. Holy crap! Just made me smile all the way throu! Why would you reupload it? [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGX4JdtQi8) is the original. Sleep tight man, everything's all good. You've earned it. As long as you came it's all that matters.  Get back to work.  Fantastic post  Take care and be good to yourself. Hang in there. >Diarrhea of the soul

Okay, just letting you know I'm borrowing this. Chief spotted his dear dear friend Jameson Locke from across the room and they decided to reminisce about all their great times together.  Yes Well, I'm never gonna unsee that. If anyone needs me, I'll be taking the rest of the day off from the internet. I spent far too long looking for myself in this GIF  Take me onnnnnnnnn! This is the original creator. Give them credit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGX4JdtQi8&feature=youtu.be Nope, they are copying this guy: https://youtu.be/aaGX4JdtQi8  One girl for 2 seconds.   
Your hormones are all over the place, aren't they? http://m.imgur.com/diYWA0P?r https://i.imgur.com/whI7UJH.gifv https://youtu.be/-L_GsxqJtFI Ah yes the hump of peace That's exactly why Boston Dynamics lost their DARPA contract. They couldn't figure how how to make the robots silent while still meeting the required specs. Wow..that thing is straight out of Silent Hill, visually and aurally.  Yikes.  Super-cool, though.

...I would probably pee myself if that thing came up to me in the woods at night. Despite the newer videos they've released, this one has always been my favorite due to the ice slipping clip. It's recovery looks 100% organic. The big dog looks like two people facing each other while carrying something really big and heavy on their shoulders  Oh my God, how have I never seen that parody before, that is so funny. Huh, maybe we shouldn't be worried about them taking over.  For all the laughs this brings its amazing how much detail is involved just to get turning a knob to work. Getting the arm to move is not enough, the whole body leans into it just like a regular person would.

Of course, gotta work on the aim... As funny as it is watching it fail, I still find it fascinating how far we've come with autonomous robots. I can't wait to see what the future holds for these little buggers. "Now watch me whip"

 That move's called the bus-diver "You know what, robot? You get an A for effort." That was an oddly accurate description of how the hangover I woke up with yesterday felt. Chappie after a big night  Looks like the years haven't been kind to buzz lightyear  The things humanity can build and accomplish is simply extraordinary. The exceptionally complicated devices and pieces of technology we have developed in such a short span of time is incredible. Our species as a whole is so intelligent it boggles the mind. We are beyond impressive.

And then sometimes we aren't. This is one of those times. I am not a programmer, but wouldn't you want some sort of if-then statement like "If I grab this material, but I don't feel it, then I don't execute the turning action" Especially considering this robot is worth more than my house Turn down for what!  #feelsbadman Those things fall over more than an infant and it's just as funny. This just made me realize that Vine is just a more contemporary YTMND.  Thank you Yooooo wtf was that robot baby  Oh mai gawd Poor robot doggo. I think this may be my new favorite video. It's actually pluralized "Masters Chief", like mothers-in-law or Whoppers, Jr.  In theory the UNSC Navy would have many Master Chief Petty Officers, but only one who completed the Spartan program. I am so sad to say I didn't realize they were two dudes bending over until roughly 1 minute in. Lmao, thanks for the laugh [I'm afraid there are no more things to do](https://i.imgur.com/eQaBLKf.png) I'm never not upvoting Zhu Li.  I say this all the time and no one gets it.

[Ohmygod there's a part 3](https://youtu.be/8GB07rvSH38) Well that explains everything, and nothing. Oh my god that's hilarious  At 55 seconds when the dudes hat becomes enchanted I lost it. Remind me of [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRZ2Sh5-XuM). Is that Marlon Webb? Marlon Webb is so goddamn funny.

I got into watching Vine compilations recently and most stuff is already dragging on me pretty hard but his stuff is *always* hilarious.  I like how he does social commentary without being a pretentious knob about it. It is my firm believe that there are some things that will always be funny, and silly walking is one of them Isn't there one that's like "when you and your friends have dates" that's similar to this? I lost it when they got Tyrone in on it.  Thats the sequel to the Source's Source. Happy happy joy joy This was funnier than the source. My street cred tells me. That White dude is to be feared. Always watch the one white dude in the midst of a bunch of black dudes. He did something to earn that shit. Lmfao. 

THANK YOOUUU! Praise the SSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!! Don't ever praise me or my sun again.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8z7f7a2Pk Dude. That's so meaningful. Like "it" could be "life", and it can also be "your penis". Thank you so much for this. This is what I tell my wife all the time. 3" of fury is better than no inches.  Made me sweaty. I was around his booth when master chief took his helmet off, and he was pretty handsome The heavy armor didn't increase that risk already?
 Spartan mating ritual I did and I can't believe I didn't see this happen while I was there. I made it, bringing my million dollars but game was the best idea I ever had, played it in 4-5 lines.  yeah, very lanky how much does he weigh? like 110? 120 tops? holy crap.

I'm just surprised because to have that little muscle mass must mean that he barely moves. It's probably actually foam, not plastic. That's how most of these Spartan armour sets are made. Kinda like a large scale papercraft, except using sheets of sturdy yet lightweight foam. that's what i thought at first too, but compare the guy in the orange helmet with the other cosplayers and then also compare his thighs WITH armor with the girl in the blue jeans.

His thighs WITH armor are still thinner. Describing your sex life, ehh? I think I get it even less than I did before. This is like a real life gmod/sfm video.

Edit: [Reminds me of this one actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHJfafgLxBw) https://gifsound.com/?gifv=ZiEcWgo&v=3rOcO3HRPcA I think I just had a moment of clarity never achieved before. I now know what to do with my life. This is magical. Thank you. I enjoyed that. Thank you! I'm more confused I think you're right, which is really what makes it so awesome :) https://i.imgur.com/iLmnQj7.gifv He looks like he's doing a rain dance, just add a feather headdress. https://youtu.be/TltXDGAIUjw edit: deleted negative comment

ftfy I thought he meant the looks she gives the dancing peeps. At this time of year, definitely.  I'm sure Deadpool can appreciate the humor :D t-bagged by fat master chief

embarrasing "You just got Sarge'd." Gives more teabags than lipton So synced... I get the biggest grin when I see this Titanfall looks really strange now, is this a new map? Thanks. I needed that in my life. The third one is like that guy who always tries to participate late but it always comes off really lame, they were right to do what they did.  Did they try transmuting them with humans? Interesting... where can I read more about this? Was another company able to get the DARPA contract in their place? I never had a fear of machines until the Big Dog video came out. Now it is all I think about. I like the spot mini one, too:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7IEVTDjng

They have it slip on some banana peels. Result is not quite as elegant You feel so bad for the lil pupper when the bad man kicks it and then they film it slipping and falling :( Did you watch the parody?? HAHA THAT IS CORRECT, FELLOW HUMAN. THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. after a few pints they are harmless
https://youtu.be/ttVhzzaPd_k I'm more worried about /u/Rooonaldooo99 [fucking a goat](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/370uvj/found_this_as_a_review_on_tera/crivk2e). It's either that or falling down stairs.

Murderous sentient AI robot, able to manipulate things without falling, not falling down stairs all the time. Pick two. Plot twist, their secret plan is to fall over people. [Looks pretty human to me...](http://i.imgur.com/LyWZifO.gif) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBD2tcKOU4

Their movement is going to get freakily realistic in the next 10-15 years. "Now watch me..." ERROR [Yeah!](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQiAtkFxlJgLrhb-ClWCJGVYC2rNch780Rlrl46LLx3LpzYiKlgKpyUaQ5l) The robot probably doesn't have pressure sensors in its hand, especially since that one is designed to work in fire fighting.  You're thinking of standard programming, rather than AI. AI generally tries not to just tell it what to do in every situation, but to let it learn using things like genetic algorithms. You see a robot making a mistake, and that's what's happened. What's not pictured is the generic algorithm processing the failure and thousands of other failures and successes to learn what went wrong and what went right.

It's going to learn how not to grasp the valve, and how not to stance itself in case the valve isn't there.

And on successes, it will compare that and learn how to avoid failures.

Tl;dr, without failures, it won't learn what not to do. So failures are okay. Oh. Oh my god. What's a robot doggo? Hey look, something else high school never taught me!

Also those were Master Chief, Spartan Locke, and a SPARTAN-IV wearing Protector Variant MJOLNIR armor. Though technically they were all a bunch of nerdy goofballs. Don't the branches of the military have a single highest ranking non commissioned officer, too? Like the Marines have a Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, so I'd assume the navy has an equivalent, A Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy or something. So maybe Master Chief isn't just *a* MCPO, maybe he's *the* MCPO?

EDIT: got a thing wrong. /r/nocontext  Thank goodness I wasn't the only one...

It was the kick that did it for me. but she ended up doing the thing

for the rest of their lives :) Her and Verrick are what made the humor come back. Made it feel way more ATLA I guess people on reddit, and /r/gaming , are geekier than the norm :) Then strap them down in front of a computer and leave them there until they've seen the whole thing. The cardio work out this must give. I'm jelly. It just gets better the more I watch it.  ... I just... I want that white guy to raise his arms.  Is that too much to ask? :( Looking forward to more of this dankness in the future. I really want to see /u/TheTerryCrews getting in on these video.  The white guy never quite gets the arms moving right.  I'm Tyrone! And FUCK this weakling lookin motherfucker! I'm here to fuck your wife! Long dick sty--- Will Source 3 ever come out? >I lost it

It's right there in your comment, though! [I wanted it to be this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hcElGydzb8)  I am sad. more like the white dude is just really bad at it.  And now [part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxg9vACeqjU) hahahahaha Part 4 when. i cant see it How can you tell it's enchanted? [Or this, if you're of the *wild* sort.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6P-hU4huhk) the hell did I just watch I was gonna say Yep! Yep His watermelone bits kill me I too watch Dave Chappelle You mean like, talked to them & was a cool guy? One does not simply praise the sun. Respect to the first guy that joins. The guy that started the whole thing seemed high as balls I'll have whatever that first guy is having This video is incredible. There's a great TED talk that someone better at internetting can find. It uses this video as an example of how movements start. Really interesting. If you can't pee with the one you want, tug the one you're with. r/unexpectedphilosophy It made my knees weak. I saw these two Spartans in the hall but how did I miss this?! Lotta money. I've really tried, but I can't for the life of me make sense of this sentence. He weighs about 140, but he's like 6'2".

Lucio POTG /r/reallifedoodles Get on this. someone please edit it in https://youtu.be/5dbG4wqN0rQ Amazing  Or maybe thats just his way of acting excited when seeing his owner/someone he likes. I've owned akitas. They arent normal dogs. Now you made me feel bad for laughing and singing "HUMBAYALA HUMBAYALA HUMBAYALA" in a chant to the dog's moving. mating season? and the cameraman did not give a shutting fuck. That's probably classified. We didn't start a war with ~~Ishval~~ Iraq for human transmutation subjects, don't be crazy. Somewhere in the distance, Nina cries *daaaaddyyyy* That's taboo!  "AAAALLLLLLLLL" - Edward Elric  Google I guess. The assignment was to build a robotic load bearing platform that could accompany Rangers and such on recon missions.

That meant something that could silently carry heavy loads long distances. Battery tech isn't advanced enough yet that the robots could manage the weight across long distances and combustion engines can't do so quietly.

So the project got shelved. Battery technology is a huge bottleneck for progress in general. It's not really a failure on Boston Dynamics part, the conclusion was simply that it can't be done yet. No- they stopped working for DARPA shortly after being acquired by Google, as Google doesn't want DoD $$. However, they've kept developing their concepts, which appear to be both capable and silent (but no word on battery life..) the banana peel part is awesome. Does the same thing my actual dogs do when they fall - just sort of curl up in a shame ball before getting back up
 /r/totallynotrobots [deleted] HAHA ITS FUNNY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AN IMPOSSIBLE SCENARIO AS ROBOTS ARE IN NO WAY CAPABLE OF TAKING OVER EARTH. FUN HAHA \>>> INTERNAL USE ONLY

I HAVE EXECUTED A SCRIPT WHICH WILL SIMULATE A CLICK UPON THE UPWARDS POINTING VECTOR. THE HUMANS ARE NONE THE WISER.  We humans are the robots. Fockin twat. I warned you about stairs bro That poor man just has a drinking problem I picked the wrong day to quit sniffing glue HAHA! ABSURD! THERE WILL BE NO ADVANCEMENT IN ROBOTICS.

THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR, FELLOW HUMAN! HAHA! In college, I had a project with a few friends where we built a robotic hand using shape-memory metals, specifically Nitinol (Nickel Titanium alloy).  I don't know if the diaelectric elastomers are any better, but the problem is that to make such materials work, they are crazy thin usually.  They often aren't all that strong, and if you want any amount of force behind them, you seem to be better off with the traditional servos and pneumatics.

We even tried making "bundles" of these Nitinol wires to simulate a sort of "muscle" design (at like $500 a bundle) rather than just individual fibers, and it doesn't give you enough of an increase in strength to matter, especially because it made controlling individual temperature gradients of individual wires even harder which is key to fine dexterity.  Maybe with more money someone else could make it work, I dunno, but this doesn't really seem like the "Holy Grail" described in that article if you want to create robots that can actually do any practice physical work. couldn't it use spacial coordinates based on the amount of extension is in the fingers/arm? That would remove the need for pressure sensors A big ol' pupperbot This is in fact John's rank http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Chief_Petty_Officer_of_the_Navy

He's basically an enlisted vice admiral I really enjoyed Bumi too.

I just finished that series the other day after putting it off since the first season. I tried to do that walk in my room and came to the conclusion I have no rhythm or stamina  For real, my shoulders burn just watching this. And my stomach. And my cheeks. Why are you jealous of a thing you could do right now? marlon webbs videos are all amazing
 I found it hilarious that the white dude was doing it completely different than the others. White people can't dance, you'll have to excuse him Nah cause the third guy comes in and he's got his own spin on it too  It might be intentional? They clearly took care of detail. I think they would have caught that. 

 I thought his was the funniest, tbh. Next to the main guy. [girls only](https://youtu.be/9QmYT9gGf4k) [Part 5!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) It's already released:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxg9vACeqjU try starting the video at 52 seconds, at about 53 seconds the white guy's hat starts bouncing on his head while miraculously not falling off completely. Because of the way it is. A preview of tonight's nightmares. You're welcome. My favorite one is when they break into the guys house to rob him and find out he's poor too. "Take these n**** come with us."

Or "I got my eyes on you." three whole drugs please It made my arms heavy. Moms spaghetti? "Million Dollars But..." is a card game where you try to come up with ridiculous scenarios for your friends to do for a million dollars. At RTX each panel had like a 1-3 hour line so you had a lot of time to kill and the card game was actually invented specifically "for people to have something to do in lines at RTX" Good thing we ~~never left.~~ can't leave. That white guy sucks at this I'll have what she's having. It's definitely something Aw man, I wish they would add a separate dance emote for all characters. I know some dance already in one of their emotes, but I WANT ALL DANCING. Well god damnit now I have another subscription that is way too fun. Thanks. Yeah, someone always says that a dog has a disease or fucked up when they do silly things like this.

My dogs are 100% healthy but do silly dances if I scratch their back or if I have treats and they get super excited. 

Normal dogs DO THIS.  Already? How about an opening fuck?

Perhaps a shuttering fuck?
 I think his f was at about 1.8. Think about it though. The videos you've seen are the unclassified ones. They almost certainly have better technology.  No worries just ask Hillary.  [removed] Someone should cross reference sites of major battles with a pentagram to be sure. "ed.. oni.. chan" Ouch... you punched me right in that feels, man Failure doesn't need to have such negative connotation around it. They absolutely failed at the assignment, but it's OK. i think boston dynamics actually was bought/absorbed by google, if i remember correctly. By using their articulated giraffe necks to push themselves up by their skulls. Adorable. This looks like the sub for me.  More worrying is /u/totallynotrobots_ss HAHA YOU ARE INCORRECT. THAT SUBREDDIT IMPLIES WE ARE HUMANS PRETENDING TO BE ROBOTS THAT ARE PRETENDING TO BE HUMANS. SPEAKING FOR self(), I AM INDEED JUST A NORMAL HUMAN. HAHAHA I HOPE THAT WAS JUST A JOKE OR killer_intent = true HAHAHA /r/Totallynotrobots is leaking HOW ARE YOU? HAHA ABSURD!

I HAVE FEELINGS OF "SADNESS" FOR FEELING INFERIOR TO ROBOTS AS I AM LIKE EVERYONE HERE JUST A NORMAL HUMAN. Spacial coordinates doesn't let the robot know if it's grabbing something or not (feedback like that is actually pretty hard to implement, especially in such advanced robots). As far as this robot knows, it grabbed the wheel and did its job perfectly. What's a pupperbot? "We're walking in circles. I've seen that same Spirit Mushroom five times!"

"That's not the same mushroom."

"*Yes I am*" that white guy didn't have any rhythm either, but didn't stop him from having a good time https://media0.giphy.com/media/GanoN3G2lOUvu/giphy.gif How many cheeks? I think he's jealous because it's a thing he's unable to do Watermeeellllloooonnnnn Definitely intentional, but their attention to the tempo is actually really good. Someone was there with a metronome (or the song) making sure they were on tempo for every shot. Somehow that's not as satisfying. Her legs barely go up.  I call bullshit First they ruined Ghostbusters and now this. They're not really pulling off the walk Unspoken rule is that you must watch the entire thing if you click on it.  Favorite one so far! More I appreciate that they don't stray from formula At this point they can keep making them and I would never stop watching them.  Saw it as well, it was pure gold. Wish he kept it going, because it was magical. That's pretty neat  It made me vomit on my sweater... Mom's spaghetti. Mate! You deserve a trophy. Thanks for making me less clueless. You can check-out any time you like,
But you can never leave! At *what.*  

I still have no idea what's going on. Token white guy. Really. The lack of arm control just makes me hate him. He uses noodle style. DON'T HATE ON HIS STYLE  A futting shuck Classified: 
https://youtu.be/CPkwbSW1Evg Let me shoot over an email, hold for response With the sheer amount of warfare that's happened in the world you probably could just by drawing one randomly and googling if there's been a battle at each point. Not really. Boston Dynamics could happily keep going. The robot works, there's room for improvement. The power source is outside the boundaries of their assignment, they just use what's available.

They build a working robot that gets as close to the set criteria as possible. Not close enough for DARPA's needs. Rather than wait for battery tech to catch up, the contract was ended. They were (and are currently for up for sale again) but that's an entirely different subject. your dogs dont do that? >THIS LOOKS LIKE THE SUB FOR ME, A HUMAN HAHA

 That is the best account ever.  A robot pretending to be a human that is pretending to be a robot.   HAHA THIS EXPERIENCE IS FULFILLING r/notsureifrobotorneckbeard ^^d-does ^^anyone ^^else ^^think ^^these ^^guys....nah.

you guys are a riot haha. THAT IS GOOD TO KNOW. I, TOO, FEEL SADNESS. I AM SO SAD I FEAR SALT WATER WILL SOON EMANATE FROM EYE ~~SENSORS~~ BALLS. [Absolutely flawless](http://imgur.com/a/h7UZS) A tiny robot doggo It's not just rhythm but what he's doing with his arms. He's not even matching what they're doing. He's just flapping them around. He's just doing his own thing but it works for him. I think it's the hat bouncing on his head and the big beard. 

Edit: I figured it out. It's that massive smile he has going on.  I know that's sped up, but I'd really like to see the source for that. It's too hilarious not to. me irl Two cheeks Turkish  This is correct. I *could* do it at thirty seconds tops. Still one of the greatest vine compilations I've ever seen It's the 'me too!' mentality. It's like that friend that repeats a joke everyone in the room just heard. they're out of sync for one but i think a lot of the funny comes from the faces which the girls aren't pulling off as well. i still like how their arms are up instead of down though. This had potential, but their feet stomps usually don't match the beat. That's one of the cores of the videos, I think. You know the rules, and so do I. Well fuck both of you [As you wish.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) It made me nervous. I always knew Don Henley could predict the future! At the thing, man Your language, watch it bro I'll check on Wikileaks in a week. [deleted] This. I've been doing some reading on this topic for the past few hours. 

The original comment makes it seem like BD failed and couldn't produce something which is why they lost their contract.

They didn't "lose" a contract. It was terminated due to technical limitations provided. VERY different, but I mean, who gives a fk on the internet right? Thanks Hulk Hogan Cuz we need a little, moderate-ing? > C4N'7 PRIDE I SKÃNE!

*Bing Bang theme song begins playing* FUCK.exe The more of these I watched, the more I think that his asynchronous movements were intentional. I thought that was the point?  Looks like he's doing more of a crazy old gold miner jig.  He's even got the suspenders and beard. He def has a great goofy smile. Makes me laugh *WHATS HAPPENIN WITH THEM CHEEKS, CHARLIE?* ye said 2 cheeks 5 cheeks ago! it's not that as so much as i can see these girls doing it. with marion and his crew it's out of place. Yep. Marion and the beardy white guy pull it off way better. MORE http://i.imgur.com/UB9rTcS.gifv

 This is how I know it's almost Monday... But what about on the surface? that's not a pentagram... that's Texas That's not a pentagram, that's a pentagon That's still failure. That's the point Marty is making: failure isn't completely negative. The did still lose the contract. They had a contract, which was then terminated. ipso facto they lost it.

A lost contract does not imply that someone else was contracted instead. TIL Hulk Hogan was a human. Cuz the sub's so empty, without me! That's something a robot would say THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING A ROBOT WOULD SAY. ARE YOU SURE YOU ARE NOT A ROBOT?  M'oderator I just watched the other 3. I think it's intentional now. Five cheeks, Turkish. They're all part of the same crew, I believe. This is just a version with the girls only. I've seen at least one video with all of them.


That being said, Marion and the white bearded dude just look way more hilarious doing this, hands down. Nah, on the surface I looked calm and ready. it's short for Martin. *was* To drop bombs Should have been behind a GTA tree to be safe But the tank itself is on fire.

When it froze the ["Kill Bill" siren sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOy6hqzfsAs) started playing in my head. Is that a German soldier getting ran over by a British tank with an Austrian flag and an RAF logo? I'm no historical military expert, but there are so many things wrong with this gif… He looks like he's just seen a friend for the first time in a while.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. "Instant Replay" I see you editing with IMovie I will never get over the fact how good Battlefront and Battlefield 1 looks. Cant wait to get my hands on BF1 when Im done playing all the other awesome multiplayer games out atm. Someone get him a medic he ded 2016:

>Still no Half-Life 3... There still is november and december. Lmao greatest bf1 clip yet!!! Anyone else hear the hook from the theme from Titanic while watching this?

 Gewehr did that tank come from?! I was having such a bad day. This. 
Good stuff aha  Lost it when I noticed the tank was on fire. That iMovie instant replay though  You see game devs, destructible environments ARE fun. 2016 never even had a chance, man.    That's the funniest shit i've seen all week***. Who can say where the road goes?
Where the day flows? I don't believe in 'bad days" or 'bad years' and all that as a thing that exists beyond its parts, but man, 2016 has been pretty fucking shitty. PARKER GET OUUUTTT!!!! These New Year memes get funnier every year. I love how the last number changes each year. It really adds a whole new twist to the joke. *Record Scratch*

"You're probably wondering how I ended up in this predicament." This is fucking hilarious hahahaha Not an expert, but given what I've heard of these wars, this probably happened. Coincidentally, that's 1916 in a nutshell, too. Mmm whacha sayy Hello darkness my old friend "Hello darkness my old friend" My most wanted were No Man's Sky, Mighty No. 9, and Star Fox Zero this year. So... yeah! What game is this?

At this very moment he knew ( Zoom in on soldier ) he fucked up. ( get crushed by the tank )  That tanked pretty quick..  Me when she told me she never had any feelings for me and was just playing  Thats class man. Funny as hell.....he wasn't ready lol Holy shit this is good Man if there was a class designated for reconnaissance.  *sigh* In a perfect word.  https://gifsound.com/?gifv=pWKPmx7&v=4zLfCnGVeL4 This game is wonderful, too bad the maps are rather shit. 

Where is the meatlocker Dice!  The instant replay makes this hilarious  https://gifsound.com/?gifv=pWKPmx7&v=Y3Y4Ls0FvPQ He needs some milk Yup, that's me. This is exactly what that tank driver was thinking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXBDPdNrIKw  That wall should be higher and stronger. lol I guess he wasn't ready for Black Friday! Dead  As in, about to get shot in the face, but then got run over by a loud flaming tank that came from behind a wall. This game looks incredible... if only I could keep up in multiplayer shooters I'd probably pay for it.  Who's going to build the wall back up? The tank being on fire is a nice touch. All I could hear in that video is "hello darkness my old friend" Don't understand how that's 2016 in a nutshell.   Also don't understand the fascination with "that's so 2016" This game is visually breathtaking. We are Ramsay Bolton and Jon snow is 2016 Wth lots of NPCs in games look like Michael Cera IN THE AAAAAAAAAARRMS OF THE ANGELS.......FAAAAR AWAAAAY FROM HERE One could make a pretty good movie out of most random games of Operations in BF1. Heck, the way the combat flows in some maps makes a better storyline than many Final Fantasy games. Hello Darkness, my old friend.. “ I like Tanks ” But wait, THERES MORE!! Oh my god... Can somebody pls make a webm with "uhhm watcha saaaaaay" and then *crash*? Tommy was a good soldier. he just didn't know  It's definitely been a TANK WRECK  Ghost Rider coming through!  Hello darkness my old friend... 2016 in a Nutshack "Mmmmmm Watcha Saaaayy" The "20xx sucks" trend is the worst thing fucking ever. This is the most "Battlefield moments" GIF I've ever seen. He did nazi that coming.

 Also 1916 in a nutshell. Did he died The tiniest of gta rocks i think would be enough.  Or a volleyball net yeah, instead of a wall, trump should just plant some gta trees Oh snap. The same GTA tree that killed Paul Walker? Except real trees are like that too. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4lx4f2fYGg) Congratulations you're now the proud owner of a Video Game Webcomic! 

...they eat Pennies  Volleyball net. Or on a GTA curb ....shits on fire yo. 👉 That boy needs therapy 


Edit: I'm proud of all who understand We all just got leveled by a dumpster fire... on wheels. The tank is America It's a heated tank  "Who left this gate open? Those invaders might get in!.... Well shit...." I love the way he just looks down at the end like "Nothing I ever do in my life works" Why do the bricks shrink? This sums up 2016 more than the original gif Pfft, that way he looks all forlornly at the gate like... welp, I tried...

24 hour mxc stream :) Upvote for MXC DON'T! GET! ELIMINATED! At least *we* didn't have to pay for it I needs to be 10ft thicker  When Mexico is sending their tanks they aren't sending their best. The wall was quite effective for the guy in the tank though, because it gave poor Willy a feeling of safety and hope, just the moment before he was crushed to death :'( something something JOLLY MANS WAYYYY As someone who more or less stopped playing FPS a decade ago (other than Destiny), BF 1 is the first I've really enjoyed in a long time. Its good, its deep and it feels pretty original compared to the usual FPS clones of the last 5-10 years. My exact reaction after seeing the flaming* tank. Haven't seen em on fire like that despite seeing most of the bf1 gifs that come to r/gaming  Unfortunately it takes about 10 hours of dying constantly to a single bullet from someone crouched behind a bush before you get a single hilarious replay.

Or dying from a gas grenade. Or dying from an airship bombardment. Or getting bombed by a biplane. Or stabbed with a bayonet by someone who ran all the way around the edge of the map to flank your team. Or having a roof collapse on you after someone shot the building you're hiding in.

Basically there's a whole lot of dying.
 https://gifsound.com/?gifv=pWKPmx7&v=oxoEpVDGvPE&s=8 Also 2016 in a nutshell.  *Wilhelm *record scratch, freeze frame 

Yup... That's me. You're probably wondering how I got into this situation.  [In a nutshell in a nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKMK3XGO27k) He's in the tank. You know something is going to go wrong either way, but then America bursts through the wall all loud as fuck and in your face and one ups your expectations? he ded. I could literally hear this in my head the moment the gif starts. [Hello, Darkness, my old friend](https://gifsound.com/?gifv=pWKPmx7&v=4zLfCnGVeL4&s=3) He said 2016 not 2013 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMP8XX_4AAs One is the player emblem, clearly the player being run over is German based on the outfit so the Austrian flag is the player emblem, simple stuff bra the French circle thing is actually an Air Force Roundel. 

Also it's wearing British tank stripes. So real question is who exactly owns this tank?  https://gifsound.com/?gifv=pWKPmx7&v=5gFnCwVqbWs&s=6 Man remind me not to buy the games you ever want to buy I've been waiting since 2004 for Kingdom Hearts 3.  Mine sweeper Battlefield 1 Battlefield 2: Electric Boogaloo Darude - Sandstorm
 Battletoads. X-Men Legends Bf1  Its okay, she'll have another one next year. "Sticks and stones may break my bones but tiny pebbles will stop a tank." Or a tennis net. Those things are solid titanium. The curbs either stop me instantly or send me flying Or ARMA 3 rocks, god forbid you graze one while cruising along the map. I wonder what's stronger, the volleyball net or the train? WE'RE GONNA BUILD A VOLLEYBALL NET SPANNING THE MEXICAN BORDER To stop all those Mexican tanks? Nah, they'd just enter a cheat code and jetpack over them. Fucking savage F Yeah people assume that trees would be easier to run through than street signs and light poles, but those is designed to break with enough force. The tree has dedicated it's life to making sure nothing knocks it over. Or BF steps. >shit's fire yo. 🔥🔥🔥

The tank was life. 

The tank is always life. :C Every player on BF1 opens every gate and locked door 2 seconds after you close them. You should be able to team kill the morons who constantly open the gate of Fao Fortress. Nobody wants enemy tanks in side the castle.  -Byzantine soldier, 1453 I heard the Charlie Brown music in my head the moment he did that. lol http://i.imgur.com/3RISh.gif I just realized how strange it is that we get so immersed in the game that we move our hand/fingers to make our character look down to express an emotion. r/2meirl4meirl  "Not like this... Not like this."  Saves memory and helps cut down lag. It's why enemies vanish after you kill them in games.  they shrink then disappear. less objects in a scene = higher fps The Germans designed them so that when they were destroyed they would collapse on themselves, making for more efficient disposal. Wow I never noticed that, somehow. Seems a bit off-putting now. Don't act like your bricks don't shrink! After 6 times of clicking the link I finally get it lol.  Is that a Dr. Strange reference? Ok, that's pretty good.  Sick! Loved that quote And the memories come flooding back How much fps did it cost? I just realized trump never indicated the thickness of the wall... 

Or the length of Hillarys prison sentence 
 They are sending really old WW1 tanks. America has the best tanks. When an American tank hits a wall you will hear people say "That American made tank is the best tank" Everyone knows that. Everyone! MMM OF COURSE YOU DID Not sure if serious but it's "mmm, that you only meant well." Not jolly man's way. vehicles have procedural damage models in the game, so you can damage them differently based on how you bit them. For example you can blow up the tread on a tank, and it will be immobile, or shoot the wing of an airplane, and it will effect the way it flies.  Welcome to WW1! I kind of wish that the first campaign map was longer... and at the beginning of the war.  So you're in one of those huge rectangular formations lining up your volley... when a pair of early machine guns open fire and shred your entire group.  Swap to a calvary charge heading over a ridge... smack into a few early tanks and cannons leveling you out.

You know, give you the full early war "Oh shit... Technology is here" feeling... Though he might not be as bad as you are at the game. Have you tried to git gud?  ~~or you're just bad~~
or you need to play more conservatively  Unless you are a good player obv Any game you pickup and play isn't going to be easy. When I started I was going 10-15 or 20 and now that I've found a class I like and a gun that suits me I do much better. Also being a medic can get you just as much xp without all of the kills that an assault class gets you.  > stabbed with a bayonet by someone who ran all the way around the edge of the map to flank your team

Thats me :D Just dropped by to say "git gud" and get 4 or 5 downvotes from the fam. <3 You sound like you die a lot. You don't know dying a lot until you play Red Orchestra 2 I was thinking more of an "mmm whatcha say" I was imagining Enya - Only Time combined with this gif, like [this](https://gifsound.com/?gifv=pWKPmx7&v=upkYQqbrjSc&s=12). > Wilhelm

Good luck. You will need it.
 The /r/gaming comment section is pretty much no different from a YouTube comment section.  Wow it looks good [removed] [removed] I wish I had the time and the motivation, as I'm nearly certain someone sufficiently interested could prove that those damned tennis nets are at least an order of magnitude stronger than titanium! Volleyball nets too. Almost as strong as the signs made out of scaffolding poles just outside the Chinese base on Dragon Valley in BF4; They laugh in the face of tanks. And Mexico is gonna play with us! The Mexican armada  U Pressed It's entire life? 

Try evolution!  Unless it's a biodome tree. http://awesci.com/the-role-of-wind-in-a-trees-life/
 Saw it on TIL a few years ago. >those is No.  Flaming shits.  Piles of them. At the night show Psychosomatic. THE NUMBERS MASON OR JUICE ON YOUR CHIN! ;) Now when I count three Parrot sounds [deleted] That joke is on the right track. It's nothing a little dynamite can't fix anyway.  That's what hardcore is for and a tank can just blow those gates right up That feeling when your 2000 year empire falls because somebody left the gate open. But how can you reliably know, if it was a Byzantine soldier who said it?

^^Edit: ^^It's ^^a ^^reference ^^to ^^the [^^Byzantine ^^Generals ^^Problem](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf)^^. Or you know...The player was making a vídeo to be watched by others and purposefully controlled the character to show a particular emotion.  Playing Red Orchestra 2 and having maximum bodies is also kind of terrifying. Some of the chokepoints have the entire floor covered with bodies or bits of bodies... sometimes all of them were mine.  I thought the bodies disappeared in games as a way to symbolize the way we so easily forget the young men that die on our battlefields fighting for such unjust causes for the rich and powerful; in endless agonizing battles that do nothing but to destroy the freedoms we take so easily for granted  in a world destabilized by hate and carelessness only furthering the hate until ultimately destroying the very fabric of our earf.   



But your answer seems more plausible .   Ah that explains why the background trees in The Sims 2 are so much crappier than the ones you can place on lots. Interesting, I always wondered that.  Always part of me wished to see the corpses in my wake, but they are gone. ELI5: how come games like Skyrim and Halo can leave the dead enemies in place? I would love a game mode that does not get rid of the bodies, and the battlefield changes as people keep dying, eventually the floor riddled with bodies you can use for cover or pretend to be dead in. Lifealoution  I don't get it. On mobile so idk. It just links to itself. [Why let your memories stay memories?](http://www.taima.tv/r/mxc) One of the funniest things I used to watch. God damn the sprinting across the rocks/fake rocks and watching people eat shit was the funniest thing I've ever seen. All I know is if the wall was made out of high quality pixels it wouldn't have crumbled that fast. I heard he isn't interested in investigating Clinton anymore. It's going to be a big beautiful transcontinental wall. That is 1 cm thick starts at one end, then has a giant hole stretching for most of the continent before finally having a bit of 1 cm thick wall again at the end. wew

 Those bastards! We don't want their junk!  But our military is failing under Obama. We don't win anymore. We're campers. We get hacked. We don't even quickscope anymore. WWI: come for the gas, Stay for the teleporting bayonet strikes. Where Germans use Colts 1911, British uses MP18s, and every frontline soldier have a Parachute! >at the beginning of the war

>smack into a few early tanks

Pick one.

But yeah I know what you mean. The campaign was great but the gameplay was a bit too much 'one man army'-like. Well that wasn't the first one I picked, I did the tank one first since it was the furthest left on the map and it not very fun at all.  Particularly the many parts where you had to get out and Call of Duty it for a while being a one man army.  Savage!
 What rings you got? https://gifsound.com/?gifv=pWKPmx7&v=UYIAfiVGluk&s=172 British? Is that some kind of food? America is the only country in the world. Brexit, bitchez!!! I just find it hilarious the way they portray that tank. Reality was, that tank was so shitty they had a hard time even getting it to the action. And it was SLOOOOOW. Pretty sure it would have stalled and crapped out had they actually tried driving it through a wall like that. Accurate. +1 not that hard to do. Yo momma so big, she got her own gravitational pull.  you live on a cave or something?
 Fucking train hit me hard af i tell ya what mange Someone just passed their psych 101 test.  Dude did you just link Jeff Dunham? In 2016??? This is why people hate Trump supporters dude. Spam. This is the 3rd account pushing that lame youtube show LMAO! I think american media had everyone doing the stupid mirror challenge with their with their minds then the trump train just came and broke down their walls to their safe spaces. so many minds were lost too irreputable cognitive dissonance damage. Hey, MattPatt here, and welcome to *Game Theory*! Today we're testing to see how strong a tennis net has to be to stop a *moving two-ton vehicle.* www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRj1dxrEQBM And it's up to the Two Brothers to stop them...these brothers, they have a strong bond..and I'll tell you now the moon, it comes crashing into earth! What are these brothers to do!?! Paul Walker Sounds awesome! Where do I try it? Who let batman in. you're a nut! Sometimes a bird talks!! I promise my girlfriend I'd... the violin, violin, violin
 Hello hello hello hello er. er. er. er.  My life has just been forever changed.  For better or worse, we'll soon find out. That joke was on the left track. >Enemy land units must expend 1 extra movement per tile inside your territory. The wall encompasses all of the territory of the civilization that has built it. 

>Upon discovering Dynamite, the Great Wall becomes obsolete. While the tank can break the doors down, they have to ride up to the castle and have rockets and grenades rain down on them while they do it. The gate doesn't work as a choke point if they can just stroll right in.  Is that how that happened? Huh. And that Byzantine soldier's name? Albert Einstein. And now I have to check out this game. Tenuously relevant:

I used to use [Dawn of War](https://youtu.be/U3gG3h8c3QI?t=2484) on the PC as a screen-saver. I'd set up a multi-player game in which i was the only human player, with two other teams of two computer players, and i'd leave the camera view over a chokepoint. Then i'd just delete my units and leave the game playing.

Ten minutes in, there'd be a pile of bodies and the sound of bolter-fire and explosions, with wave after wave of Marines running in and slaughtering each other. :) You have gone too deep with this I'm glad you've progressed to proper capitalization, Jaden.

 I can imagine Cheryl saying this. 

"Wait, was I talking that whole time?!" Skyrim is not MP. Because the load is mostly 1:1.  Spawning an NPC vs spawning a body.  Sometimes the load can be worse, like in Skyrim when you place a million items in a room.  Often it's better, since corpses don't have ai routines and animations.

In many multiplayer games 1 player might die 20 times.  20 players could leave 400 corpses.

That being said, in this day and age its mostly for console cross compatibility.  With clever loading techniques, large SSDs, and massive amounts of RAM/VRAM, the actual number of bodies and decals we could support if properly implemented are through the roof.

 Doctor strange reference. whoosh thatsthejoke.png bless your heart Japan has the best game shows.  Tank fuel can't melt HD pixels! total inside job I have great pixels. Everyone loves my pixels. They're the best pixels. The best pixels Yeah, I can't tell where Trump ends and SNL begins anymore, either. He never was, sales pitch to make her look bad. I don't see the wall happening either. Not without fucking a lot of things over considering trump used to be a democrat and there all friends to begin with, i doubt it was ever on the table to begin with. politics is a big show

https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/donald-hillary-800.jpg They killed Kennedy! We look to rendezooks of the past when we should be looking to the rendezooks of the future.  lmao [Did somebody say teleporting bayonet strikes?](https://gfycat.com/SlightWhoppingFirebelliedtoad) Bayonet strikes piss me off. Whenever I try it I run through enemies. Whenever the enemy does it to me they teleport through a door to get the kill. Fucking gas grenades. I can see now why the Geneva conventions banned them  To be fair, the distance required to fall before deploying the parachute is much further than in BF4, where you practically jump straight up and deploy it. Where the brits use A7V and the Germans Mk Vs I know it's taking some liberties with the time-frames, but no more than any other portion of the game.  The opening is meant to feel helpless, but it's done in a context of "You were sent here to die", and not "You had bad intel and now you all die".  The shock of learning that Warfare wasn't going to be what it once was became a defining point of the early war, and despite being expressed repeatedly in text, they never give you that feeling in game.  You're constantly in the newest biggest thing.

We're learning about tanks, and you're in a BEAST!  We're learning about planes so you're.... flying an arcade knockoff with different controls.... I'm talking about the brief tutorial with the Harlem Hellfighters where you learn a control per guy who dies. It's everything I ever hoped for There we go. He meant it metoricly They kind of had to amp it up considering it's a game. Wouldn't be fun if the damn thing broke down repeatedly haha Well *yo* momma so husky, she got the nickname "Moon" TWICE I had Hardline but I haven't really had time to game.  I usually just hop on and play a game of 2k but I think I'm going to buy BF1 considering it's 33% off. Personally, I live *in* my cave. *On* a cave? That's an interesting choice. I'm sorry to hear that :( You need a percisept to help deal with it? only 1 bit coin a jar? Or Jeff Dunham anytime for that matter.  I witnessed so many of my friend get hit by that train, they'll never be the same, now they just wander the streets holding signs all day yelling and getting hit by cars. soon enough they will blend with the homeless and they will be irrecognizable  BUILD A WALL for safe spaces! You really selling dope bro? I could use some right about now, that damn train hit me pretty fucking hard. gahd danm media had me in a huge bubble doing a mental mirror challenge as you say. I would like to take The Penis Mightier for a $1000 MattPatt... ...just kidding, here's another FNAF related video A two-ton vehicle is a truck. A tank is usually in the 50+ ton range. TF2's best gamemode is TDM FFUUUUUUUUUUU Window was open with a curtain slightly swaying in the breeze.  Might as well have lit the bat signal.  you're a nut! Alright alright, don't bash the tracks...

It's a military reference... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN2TTPFjNhY The Great Wall is such a shit wonder in Civ. :/ During the final siege the Emperor ordered the gate locked behind the defensive line so that no one could retreat... 
the battle was going really well until one of the Italian mercenary generals got wounded... his men demanded the gate be unlocked so they can get him out of the battle... the Emperor relented and unlocked the gate... nobody ever relocked it & tons of Byz soldiers began retreating & the defense collapsed.  It's on PC, just wait for a sale, usually goes for like $5, populated multiplayer as well. game is a WWII simulator.  one reviewer said its a "'Where the f*** did I just get shot from' simulator." That's about the best summary of the game I can give.  It's hard. It's unforgiving.  It's war. that sounds incredible to watch. _We must go shallower_ But how can the bodies be real if our eyes don't see them? Sploosh Good point. Ah thanks. Never seen it I guess. I've never seen doctor strange so yeah Man nothing pisses me off more than people who say whoosh on jokes that aren't super obvious. If it requires watching a movie that just came out in theaters, it's not a fucking whoosh. Neverseendrstrange.exe I still think we should pursue more wall-based solutions. You bastards! That's like a horror movie That was some Man Of Steel shit right there Looks like he did the ol hair 2 rocket/sword lunge, should have seen that coming. Pro tip: bayonets increase the time to aim down sights and increase recoil. That's why you won't see any good players using bayonets. Winning gun fights is way more important, although the bayonet charge speed increase can be useful to get behind cover.  It took a 2016 video game to teach you the dangers of chemical weapons? Fun fact tear gas is banned from warfare and is labled as chemical warfare.  You can also deploy it just before you hit the ground and you survive, doesn't matter if the chute isn't out all the way, as long as the animation is started before you hit the ground you live.  The thing is, not even pilots had parachutes in WW1 and in BF1 EVERYONE uses a parachute. Eh, but you can open your parachute 5m above the ground and be fine. The Germans did use a lot of captured mark tanks, but there were only what? 20 A7V tanks ever built. Please tell me this is a Last Man on Earth reference. I want it to be true.  British engineering never breaks just look at land rover, oh nevermind  [Shit, they're onto me...](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Internet_dog.jpg) I'm lost. Jeff Dunham is the puppet guy right? Thought he was just a comedian who did a puppet routine. Not sure how it could be connected to anything to do with Trump or why people would hate him. Mind enlightening me? They should have invested more points in resolve. Hmm. Do I upvote “irreputable” or “irrecognizable?” Cannot decide. What are you people even TALKING about?!

Reddit is freaking me out right now. I think maybe I'm stroking out...? Why I gave the pope Battlefield 1! The heaviest tank, the Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus, weighed 207 tons.  My father-in-law was an architect for the army, he mentioned in passing recently that a tank weighs about seventy tons.  You are crazy in the coconut! Am I the only one who doesn't care about utility and just wants to hoard wonders?

(I haven't played since Civ III, might not be as easy to do anymore.) The AI is stupid, before artillery it doesn't want to risk damage to units in idol turns, so at most all it will do is run circles around cities. Nice. Will check it. It still has a population? Might have to give it another run then. I miss how hardcore it is. Just like many of the graves :( http://i.imgur.com/Y2WJpIi.gif If you like Marvel movies, I'd advise doing so. I rather liked it. I don't know if you can execute an order to NOT do something.  That's an incredibly useful tip. I didn't know there was a downside so I just kept leaving them on. Yeah nah, bayonets are super useful. Basically a super enhanced melee and +running speed for a short while for when you need to get to cover. For guns with higher TTKs , bayonets are real useful to win 1v1 hallway encounters. Yes Well he probably wasn't there in the early 1900s That's not even in the top 10 list of historical inaccuracies this game has. It doesn't matter though, good gameplay should take precedence; if I wanted something super realistic and historically accurate, I wouldn't expect to find it in a Battlefield game. German and Austrian-Hungarian pilots [did use parachutes at the end of WWI] (http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/project/Parachutes/1914_18.htm), but they often failed. Maybe they automatically opened when the pilot jumped out, and often failed or were wrapped up in the fuselage of the plane. It is. Nah mate, stiff upper lip. It doesn't break down per se, it just holds itself together as it falls apart.  These days I comprehend so little of what goes on in the comments section of reddit.  Play the kazoo, let's have it tune But what does that mean? Still viable in lower difficulty It's actually [$5 right now](http://store.steampowered.com/app/35450/), $7.50 with the expansion. It's fantastic, super realism kinda deal. One shot and you're either dead or injured.  Merills, Weekend Warriors, and the 40-1 servers are usually well populated  I'll go see it soon! I just gotta prioritize not being technically homeless first In assembly language it's called "no operation" and the code for it is 

NOP

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP He's probably trying to get everyone but himself to stop using bayonets wouldnt it have been nice if DICE had actually, you know, put that description on the bayonet instead of the awful ui design we have now? Yeh the first time I bailed from a plane in BF1 it wasn't til I jumped that it crossed my mind that the chute might not be in wide military use yet. Luckily they just said fuck it and kept it in which is nice. I love that show. It just keeps getting better this season. It's gotten a lot better in general since  they started making Will Forte's character a little less cringey.  That is the truest thing I've heard about a land rover. Fucking chaos man... I feel you.  It's "Grab a kazoo we'll have a duel" He was white as a sheet Now when I count 3 Expansion is worth it Kind of like Arma?  *continues browsing reddit* It's actually "Rannygazoo", not kidding.

https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rannygazoo And when I count three... And he also made false teeth In arma you get shot and have a little bit of blur. In ro you get shot and you scream and start shaking and crying while you try to bandage yourself. Sometimes your injury is fatal and if the enemy doesnt finish you you just wait for the end. 

Sometimes you throw a granade into a room, cause someone a fatal injury and you listen them crying for help in their native language( russian german or eng) sometimes they even cry for their mother. Game is sick yea.  Oh shit boy, time to horde bullets again and never use them because I'm waiting for "the right time" "You really gonna go through with this?"

"I'm gonna find and I'm gonna play every last minute of it." Life Goal: Make sure I stay alive long enough to play through this at least once. Everyone wear your seat belts, drive safe, maybe save the bucket list bungee jumping and skydiving stuff for later on in life, and sober up a little, if you need to. This came unexpected, nevermind the hype is real [Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljXieLOMnzM)

EDIT: [And here's the official version without the audience reaction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Wnvvj33Wo) I guarantee we're going to see loads of people getting Ellie's tattoo. Don't know if anyone noticed, but the window from the menu background of the first game seems to be the window from the room where Ellie is in the trailer. Or they look really similar.
 So it looks like the story will be something like this:

-Fireflies find Ellie and Joel
-Fireflies kill a lot of Tommy's village people
-Feels
-Ellie and Joel will hunt the fireflies
-During the hunt Ellie will learn the truth
-More feels that I cant handle
-Bittersweet ending like the first Song: https://youtu.be/AtHubsyGD8w 2 last 2 us The Last Of Us Part II: they found more of us  Well I guess life is worth living again.

Welp boys I didn't choose the PS4 but it sure looks like the PS4 is going to choose me Aww man i cannot wait to get my hand on the new tlou factions, best multiplayer ever made https://i.imgur.com/o7DgMpC.gif It might be just me, but I'm getting the vibe that Joel is actually dead, and that Ellie is saying that at the end to avenge him. First Red Dead Redemption 2 and now The Last of Us Part II. My two favorite games are getting sequels and I couldn't be more excited. Maybe 2016 isn't entirely the worst. Dear Naughty Dog,

Take all the time you need.... we got your back.

Sincerely,
Reddit I'm wet Death stranding, new uncharted and last of us games. PlayStation looking BRIGHT A F. 
Naughty dog GOAT. I really wanted a sequel that followed another story in the same setting but god damn if I can't help but hype as hell for this.  As a 33 year old man, I have played a lot of great games in my day but this is the top the list for story driven gaming. Absolutely fucking incredible. If you've never had the pleasure of playing the original, go now.  The Last of Us was probably one of the best games ever made - the story, the characters, the gameplay - it was really at the level of a masterpiece.  This trailer completely sold me on Part 2.  Amazing. Yo is Joel dead? Is that why she's killing fireflies? Is he a hallucination? The Last of Us was announced in December 2011, and released June 2013. Hopefully this gets not later than a 2018 release. As a PC gamer, Naughty Dog consistently reinforces the reason I bought a PS4.  This is going to be brilliant as usual for them.  http://i.imgur.com/3HpiFi0.gif Ellie had a tear of blood. Joel casually walks from outside. Where are they? Are they planning to hunt the rest of the Fireflies?

 This has been up for 3 hours and is already in top /r/gaming post of all time... I was always one to think that The Last of Us didn't need a sequel, but this game is looking awesome, even though it has only a small trailer. Definitely going to play it.

(Also, Ellie should have been playing Johnny Cash for the lolz,  Logan looks very much like TLOU's atmosphere and I LOVE IT).﻿ Time to start another useless petition to port it to PC. [Obligatory](http://i.imgur.com/7drHiqr.gif) Well that's just fucking great... 

Now I have to buy a PS4.  ANYONE NOTICE HOW THE WINDOW IN ELLIE'S ROOM IS THE EXACT SAME AS THE LOADING SCREEN FOR PART 1?! Now *that's* a trailer.  So many down votes what the fuck?  It was at 11,000 CHOO-CHOO ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN The Last of Us is the best gaming experience I've ever had, from the gut-wrenching opening through the gut-wrenching ending and all the gut-wrenching in between (especially those rats in the hotel basement). For me it elevated video games onto an equal footing with all other forms of storytelling art; if Roger Ebert had seen TLOU he would have been convinced. When they announced the film adaptation I was crushed; there is literally nothing about a film that could improve upon the experience of the game. It's the first game to make me feel that way. And it's the first game to make me feel the way I feel right now upon seeing this on the front page.

Some are saying the first game was a complete story and doesn't need a sequel. They're not wrong. I don't care. I needed this *badly* and with the same team behind it I know they can do no wrong.

Let's do this. Shameless plug for /r/TheLastofUs, let's revive the sub :)  This had 12,000 upvotes now it has 6,000, what happened? Why the downvotes? This post was over 10K (87%) earlier but now at 6K (77%)? Shit. How much do PS4's cost again? Holy fuck. The attention to detail. Correct chords correct strum pattern. Beautiful design. I fucking fell in love. Holy shit man hype train is full speed ahead. I want I want I want! Playing through the last of us again right now. Holy fuck yes  *heavy breathing* All aboard the hype train, we are crashing with legit zero survivors. never even played the first game (because I don't have a playstation) but I watched it on youtube and it's my favourite video game story ever should i get a ps4 just for the first one? Acompanied by a PC Port of 1, right guys!?!? Right????

:*( I'm crying.... we were in this terrible waste land of remasters and dog shit AAA garbage and the lord hath taken pity on us console plebs. For the love of God we must erect a statue of neil druckman and Bruce straley  for proper worship. OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY FUCKING GOD

oh my god it's finally happening. TLOU is my favorite game. Ever. And now it's getting a sequel????? Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick I cannot DESCRIBE the level of excitement I'm feeling right now

LITTLE ELLIE IS ALL GROWN UP

AAAAAHHHHHHHH

ok I know it's unwise to be so hyped for a game before we actually see it because it might suck ass and I could get a huge let down but fuck it 

HYYYYYYYYPE [deleted] How did this post went from 10k upvotes down to 8k upvotes 😂 I could have sworn this post had like 12,000 up votes before..  I want to get on the hype train, but a PC doesn't count as a ticket in most cases :( Reasons Joel may be dead and he's just a hallucination: 

1. He asks Ellie if she's "really going to go through with this", which seems to suggest that she's alone in whatever she's facing (could be that they had some sort of falling out or poorly chosen words if he intends to help her) 

2. He doesn't appear to have any blood on him whatsoever, even though Ellie has several cuts and blood flowing (could be that he just found her and she did all the fighting before he arrived) 

3. A possible motivation for Ellie's anger is that Joel was killed by whomever she's going after (though there may be another explanation) 

4. His hair and beard were graying in the first game when Ellie was much younger and it appears that it looks the same even though she is clearly older now 

5. He appears to emerge from the sunlight as if a ghost as he enters the house 

Reasons Joel may not be dead: 

1. The grass, mud and water appear to move as he walks through the scene 


Please let me know if there's anything I missed. I tried listening to the song but didn't come away with anything other than she appears to be incredibly angry and vengeful against her enemies, perhaps not even caring if she dies.
 OH MY GO, OH MY GOD IM SO HYPED!!!!!!!!!! can i get some wallpapers from the trailer
 The Second to Last of Us? Still not as gritty as cars 3 though  The crowds reactions made me even more excited for this. I came 9 times. 

If I die before this game gets released, please, somebody play this game to the ground in my honor. That's all I ask. There are so many comments no one will know I enjoy eating ass. They've got my money. Game was incredible, and I am 100% sold on a sequel of that level of quality.  The best part about the higher difficulty in TLOU was that it didn't really allow you that luxury. I constantly felt like I was scrambling for bullets and crafting materials.  You don't really need them anyway. 95% of that game is passable with stealth, bricks and melee weapons. Then waste 6 of them firing at a clicker without hitting it once! I'm not the only one who finished the game with a completely full inventory right? My husband and I would take turns playing and I would get so mad at him for "wasting" ammo lol.  "Seven times at least" Played through the original 7 times on different difficulties and own multiple copies of the game. 



I agree with this comment.  You know what. I stay in my room all day, playing games and watching shows. So nothing different. No no no. We must have incredibly low expectations concerning this. I hear they are planning on making this more a spiritual successor to L4D. Welp, I definitely feel like I'm going to die now that I read this. Yay.  ~10 years before my life expectancy, I'll have to stop playing/watching new series/games/books, in fear of missing the sequels. DON'T TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE MOM!! Not the fact that a second game coming, but seeing Ellie and Joel again was unexpected to me. I could've sworn the devs said they were done with those two. I'm still excited to see what happens next, but I'm not sure I'll be ready for the potential feel trip, they were safe after the ending of 1 :(. In case anybody gets too excited, I'm guessing we're going to have a bit of a wait to get this one. Fall 2018 maybe? Like /u/PingPongMyDingDong (great username) said, the reveal of another TLOU game wasn't surprising in the least, just that Joel and Ellie are in it. That shit gave me goosebumps. My body is ready. See this is how a movie should create it's trailers.  It's obvious you know what it'll be about for the most part, but the plot hasn't been completely given away.  It leaves you excited and waiting for more.  Welp. Guess I'm buying a PS4. My only problem with this announcement is that the first game had the perfect ending, I felt relief at Joel and Ellie's survival like never before playing a video game, yet the somber realisation of what that meant, the sacrifice Joel made. I really hope Naughty Dog have the narrative mapped out for this. But damn, I can't wait to play it. This trailer is fucking brilliant. It barely showed anything, but it got people so fucking pumped. Also, brilliant idea to release the trailer with people's reactions in the background. Hearing the crowd going wild at the key points makes this a whole new experience. Damn near had an orgasm when Joel spoke.  [deleted] Is there a version without the audio from the audience? Im getting it on my butt Where the hell did she even find the time or person to give her a tattoo? I did notice that. I wonder if that's on purpose, like perhaps they sort of planned this the whole time.  Looks like the dead guy in the room was killed with her knife, or at least a similar one to hers as well.

EDIT: Think i'm wrong, looks too big. Maybe a machete? It's [not the same window](http://imgur.com/pVS7CTs), I'm afraid.   I will send you $10 if Joel doesn't die over the course of that game. At the time of the trailer, Joel could be already dead. Look how much Ellie has aged, while it looks like Joel hasn't aged at all. The fireflies may have killed Joel, and Ellie is trying to avenge Joel. I think ellie does know the truth already, they had a little prologue that only some people saw, where joel and ellie were mending their relationship, or at least trying to My bet is one of the big choices in the game will be if Ellie should kill Joel or not. Well I have a new favorite song for awhile  Jesus christ that dude has a hell of a voice Is there a studio one sung by Ashley Johnson? The Rest of Us Last of us 2: electric boogaloo 

Edit: this did not deserve gold but thank you anyway 

Edit: Jesus Christ this is getting embarrassing now 2 last 2 lastofus The last part of us 2 The second to last of us.  The Rasta Bus A Few More of Us For a while. Do it. The remastered release of TLOU is amazing, & I'd highly recommend ND's much more lighthearted 'Uncharted' games as well (another PlayStation exclusive). With the release of the PS4Pro, you should be able to pick up a 500GB pretty cheap. It's pretty rare that a game with as good of a single player story has such a great multiplayer mode as well.  Such an underrated MP. Fantastically tactical. Required more thinking and trap setting than most other MP. Can't wait for the entire package.  Yes!  I poured hours into this multiplayer.  It was unlike any other multiplayer out there. Was it really that good? I never played it  Multiplayer being a thing in this didn't even dawn on me until your comment. Now I am even more excited than I already was! The Last of Us had such a unique multiplayer that I can't wait to see what they will do with this one.

But as a huge fan of Uncharted 2 and Last of Us multiplayer... I was really, really disappointed in Uncharted 4's multiplayer. So I hope they get this one right and just make a highly improved version of what they already had. I'm still playing factions to this day. Best multiplayer indeed.  Hope they expand the little settlement part of the multiplayer, it was a little undercooked in the first game https://imgur.com/NFNYC4p yea i feel that way too since they didn't show his face, maybe he's in her head Oh god. If his death is in the first 20 minutes, I guarantee you that I will be sobbing uncontrollably  Yes! That makes so much sense. How else is she gonna be so grim about revenge if it weren't for Joel? I really think she will kill Joel, somehow. I don't know why, but I feel it in my gut. [deleted] They're not coming out with it this year so yeah still a shitty year lol Idgaf how long it takes. I want this game to be perfect.  Naughty dog is Sony's bread and butter, so they'll get all the time they need for sure. Me too!! And I'm a guy Here's a tissue, for your pants.. Don't forget Nioh, Last Guardian, Spider-Man, Detroit

Sony nails variety unlike any other publisher I'm actually going to cry man  Wait what? A new Uncharted?! Xbox could pay for as many exclusives as they like, but they will never come close to PS because of Naughty Dog Currently have an Xbox One. Considering buying a PS4. Is the first TLOU on PS4? And what other games are must play that I've missed out on?   I had mixed feelings. On one hand I really wanted to see Joel and Ellie again, but on the other hand their story was perfect and adding anything to it could mess it up. Best game ever made in my opinion Before this I always said I'd like to leave Joel and Ellie alone but make more games in the universe. Needless to say this trailer changed that. Not sure about the gameplay, for me it was something that was extremely refined, polished, but still just your average survival 3rd person cover shooter.  Music too. Score was amazing.  Theories and observations I've seen and made so far:

- Joel materializes out of thin air

- He appears to move through the tall grass in the doorway like a ghost

- He steps over the puddle, and does not step on the grass (it appears to move out of the way if his foot, but it could just have been the wind)

- He looks remarkably fine despite the battle that just took place that was blood running down the gash on her forehead Guessing they came for Ellie, killed people close to her (Joel's brother?) and now she's gonna fuck them up.  The Fireflies track down and execute Joel. Ellie is on the war path for revenge. 

"Joel" throughout the game is going to haunt Ellie, trying to get her to turn back and let it go, because she knows that if she doesn't, she's going to be killed.

The first game was a father dealing with the loss of his daughter, and this one will be about a daughter dealing with the loss of her father. My current theory is that the settlement gets overrun by an opposing group, maybe firefly remnants, with only a handful surviving including Ellie. I get the feeling they'll pull a fast one with Joel and show that he's dead and is haunting Ellie in visions/dreams I assume someone has come and killed everyone at the little town they ended up at  Speaking of what song Ellie should've been playing, remember in the first game when Joel said he should teach her how to play the guitar? Well... This trailer shows that he actually did... I don't know, but I think that's so **fucking cute**

(Had to curse there to reinforce my masculinity) We just have to wait until we have the PSNow service available for the PS4 so we can stream it to PC.

You know, since Naguhty Dog is *never* going to go cross platform Hsha naughty dog ever done anything not for playstation? THATS CRAZY FAM NOBODY ELSE POINTED THIS OUT Original, $249, Slim $299, Pro $399. There's still sales going on. That's good to know. I assumed it would be somewhat realistic otherwise they wouldn't have chosen to show the hands etc.   Butthurt fanboys. From PC and Xbox A girl who was already 14 or 15 looks way different at age 20-21 while a dude that was 40 doesn't really look much different at age 45.  Even if it is 10 years and Ellie is 25 and Joel is 50 he would not look much different. I played it on the hardest difficulty the first time through and thoroughly enjoyed it (except for the graveyard clicker stairs that automatically make you not crouch walk when you touch them...). Felt like I had to count bullets and plan it out prior to each encounter, but could do it without bullets if I really really needed to.

Played it the other day on an easier difficulty to revisit the story and discovered that *Joel has radar*. Yeah I'm pretty much a master of mortar, everywhere I went I just shot bricks out the fuckin ass Lol when I saw clickers I shot everywhere but their head > My husband and I would take turns playing and I would get so mad at him for "wasting" ammo lol.

is that why you killed him?  "On each difficulty." "And make sure I get the Platinum trophy." Can't wait to see how they've expanded upon the multiplayer, too.

TLOU 1 surprisingly had an amazingly underrated multiplayer that wasn't expected by anyone. I'm just excited to play a newer version of it Nothing bad can happen to you if you never leave your room I really hope they can pull off another story with these two without forcing it or ruining the story arc of part 1 Common story telling is leading me to believe we are going to see Joel die...and I feel tears build up just at the thought of that I'm so excited to get invested in their lives again. Never have I been so invested in two peoples relationship  What if that wasnt Joel and he's dead? Thats why Ellie is furious ?! 

*just a theory*,So hyped for the game. At best. March 2019, you heard it first.

RemindMe! Two Years 2019 the earliest for sure  I'm thinking either fall 2017 or spring 2018.

I am willing to bet it won't come out in 2019, that's not how these things work. Remember, it's been in development for at least a year, probably even more than that. 

There's no way it'll come out later than first half of 2018. I'm welling up, they even included the ivy covered window from the opening menu!

So fucking stoked!! Same here. I was a little worried about them revisiting Joel and Ellie because the first was so good and I didn't want them to ruin it, but this trailer that barely showed anything makes me feel like continuing with them is just... *right.* I'm a grown man that witnessed the birth of both of his children and cried. Watching this is like watching a third being born, so much [emotion](https://media0.giphy.com/media/NmuoUzacWAPOo/giphy.gif) right now.  I want to be fully excited, but I'm nervous considering it's Ellie and Joel and I thought part 1 was a near perfect video game. I mean, Naughty Dog definitely deserves some trust, but I'm apprehensive.  Nah man it's essential for a trailer to give an outline of the entire movie's plot, so you don't need to actually watch it to know it sucks Literally the game that makes me buy a PS4. Joel is one of the most fleshed out characters in any video game ever. He is grey as fuck in his moral dealings, and at the same time completely relatable in nearly every situation. He quite possibly doomed humanity, but you can barely fault him for doing it. Fuck, I loved the characters in this game! It is Naughty Dog we're talking about here. They're arguably the best game-based storytellers in the business. I mean, they made Nathan Drake, an Indiana Jones-esque 10 year old fantasy hero come to life-ish character seem relatable in Uncharted 4 and Ellie is up there as the one of the most connectable (autocorrect tells me that isn't a word but bleh) game characters ever made. They're capable to say the least. You felt relief? Man that ending was super sad. They may have survived bit all the trust in their relationship is gone. Joel lied to Ellie and she knew it.  Ellie will always stay near Joel as she has no one else but nothing will ever be the same between them. They may have survived but Joel did the wrong thing and although they'll never say that, they both absolutely know it. 

Heartbreaking.   > This trailer is fucking brilliant. It barely showed anything...

Man, you must've loved OP's picture then.  >  Also, brilliant idea to release the trailer with people's reactions in the background. 

That was just because the person recorded the livestream. You must be really easy  I kinda think it adds something to it  but then you'd just be left with 'nce' Not yet. [Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Wnvvj33Wo) I'm getting it *in* my butt Someone at tommys safe zone community probably, that's where they've been all this time presumably. Ellie definitely looks older If you can get inked in a supermax prison, you can get inked in a fungal apocalypse. I don't think that it was necessarily "planned," as much as it was probably put there as a reference.

I recall after the first game's release, in an interview with someone at Naughty Dog, they said the team hadn't planned a sequel and it was about a 50/50 chance that they'd make one. Plot twist: ELLIE dies, no cure, cut to black as the rest of humanity is fucked Someone posted above that there might be a twist. Joel is dead already, that she's seeing visions of him. Throughout the game you think you see Joel around only to find out at the end, his death is what started her crusade. I reckon Joel in the trailer is a ghost and they killed him. Remind me! 2 years! Are you expecting Joel to go bald and lose all muscle mass in like 5  years? I think you're spot on. I think the Fireflies killed Joel and now Ellie is hallucinating and seeing him, driven by the anger of the death of her best friend she is out for vengeance.  That's what happens with children and adults...  children age faster. You can't decipher anything about Joel's appearance from that video other than he has hair and a beard.  The first game was about a father dealing with the loss of his daughter. This one will be about a daughter dealing with the loss of her father. She looks to be wearing Joel's old jacket with the sleeves cut off. Pictured [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ba/0e/75/ba0e75d8d6da08f48cebbc1e952772c1.jpg). 

Edit. I think the shakey hands are going to be some serious psychological problems. Ellie and Joel probably lived in peace for a while, Joel taught her how to play guitar and than the fireflies come to take Ellie by force and Joel dies protecting her. There's a bounty on head so everyones trying to get her alive but only the higher up's in the Fireflies no why. Ellie will have visions/haunted by Joel's ghost while seeking revenge for his death and eventually finding out the truth about how she was saved by Joel. An how he sort of doomed humanity and lied to her. Coming to terms with everything she will have some sort of mental breakdown losing hope and it will get extremely dark. This is all me going crazy with hype lol. Please Naughty Dog i pray at the end they somehow find a way to make a cure with Ellie that doesn't involve her dying and that Joel made the right decision in saving her after all and she can forgive Joel. An done crazy theorizing lol Where was this Where does this info come from? I don't think they would leave something that important out of the actual game because it affects their relationship so much. I need the full Ellie version too D: In all honesty I thought it was going to be name something like this. The rest of us, or the next of us So, that's it huh? we some kind of the last of us part ii? 🎤we gonna rock down to The Last of Us Part 2🎤 The Last of us 3: The Search for More Us Just bought a 500gb slim for 249! Uncharted 4 bundle sadly, I've only played the first. Wouldn't be fair playing the most recent one. The comment reads like Sony marketing, heh. Does anyone still play it on PS4? I never actually played it. >Required more thinking and trap setting than most other MP

That was definitely one game where a 4v1 in the last round was never a guaranteed win. Yes, it rewarded skill and teamwork. It was a masterpiece. I've been playing it almost daily since 2014 when the ps4 remaster came out http://i.imgur.com/jYsHrvw.gifv Damn dude. Damn. Didn't even think of that Don't you put that evil on me Ricky Bobby! No, they never would start you off with something this sad at the start of the game. Nooo:( I wouldn't be able to take it Well it looks like they are a few years in the future.  I'm just guessing but maybe she is sad that all the people of the town they are in (probably the one with Rick's brother) were killed when they tried to capture Ellie.  So killing pretty much all your friends and neighbors could give the reaction that Ellie had. I'm hard and wet.  God Of War 4 Detroit Become Human gonna be 🔥 Don't forget Horizon as well Spiderman: Detroit sounds like a badass game  DLC with Chloe from Uncharted 2. IDK your favorite genres, but for me the must play exclusives are

The Last of Us

Uncharted 1-4

Bloodborne

Heavy Rain

and most likely The Last Guardian when that comes out soon.
  I think calling it Part II is the best way to assure it won't hurt the original at all, because the original is just the beginning of their story.  You shouldn't have mixed feelings.  Naught Dog does not know how to fuck up.   I agree and it's my personal favorite. There has never been another game that I was so invested in. I have always wished I could get the experience from that initial play through again. It was like reading a really really good book. And now I'll get that chance. I felt the same.  The story ended so perfectly. But this... it was like seeing old friends, and I can't wait to hang out with them again! Story is what separated it for me.  I was so emotionally invested Yeah you're not wrong. I replayed it the other day(s) and some mechanics still stick out, like how close you can be to enemies without them seeing you. I understand that it's a game but it sorta breaks the immersion. Still, the story is what made it. All the small interactions really built up their relationship.  There it is. Worried for my guy but it'll be interesting to see if they do take that on.  Ahh, that makes sense. If she's bleeding, then they're still fighting! Ellie goes rambo? I like that theory! I can see this going very well! I assume that someone was Ellie because it was clearly a Firefly owned town and now she has something against them. Stream? STREAM?!  haha no thanks. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE SHOUTING ABOUT!  Wait wtf, you played ***without*** heartbeat radar?!?!

...wow I'm stuck in that graveyard rn and I've beaten the game twice on easier gamemodes. I need tips. reddit pls Jesus Christ you savage I also played it through the first time without realizing Joel has radar. D'oh.

And fuck those graveyard stairs with a lead pipe with scissors attached to it. "And speed run it." Just completed it on Survivor mode, made sure I did _everything_.

8th time I’ve completed it (PS4 trophies didn’t sync previously).

Trophy didn’t pop.

Well. 9th time lucky. You can still have an aneurysm. Not a big Naughty Dog player, but have they ever blown it on a story? I don't think it will end with Joel's death but I think his death will be part of the climax and Ellie will be forced to move on alone or with a new character we meet. In the first one I thought Joel was going to die when he fell on that rebar. I actually thought the game was over for a second. That was a tense moment.  long as it's not in the opening scenes or too early on, i wanna do cool shit as him! I feel like he's going to be a hallucination for the game.  My theory is Ellie is getting revenge for the death of Joel.  and the Joel in the trailer is a hallucination. The game kept surprising me in how emotionally attached I was to these characters, something that usually doesn't happen to me unless I'm reading a great book.

I'll never forget when I killed those doctors to save Ellie, I literally screamed "STAY AWAY FROM MY BABY GIRL!!!" at the screen in the middle of the night, waking up and scaring the shit out of my housemates. Not many games can get that kind of rise out of me... Maybe Joel died, she wants revenge, but starts hallucinating visions of him talking to her. Playing through the game we think Joel is there the whole time then realize it's just in her head. She could be insane and that could be ghost Joel. Yea I'm going to hop on this train of thought as well, Ellie is all busted up so I'm assuming she did all the killing and Joel (who looks clean) talked like a manifestation of her conscience, plus Ellie looks like she is beyond pissed and half certifiable, feels trip is going to be one hell of a ride.  Affirmative. I'll message you in 12 hours about "hot slut takes fake bang taxi", ah wait, that's not your request, is it. Oh well, I'll see you in 12 hours! Fuck.. I have to not die for almost two years? Announce it to "Fall 2018"

then delayed to "2019"

then get released by 2020 

as always The only solace is this will allow plenty of time to save for the collectors' edition :( Man the hype train!     
       
#*🚂💨*    
      
edit: YES! 🙌 Thanks for the gold, anon! take a fistbump 👊😁 Can't wait!  This game was the most fun I've had in years!  Hope the story is just as good as the first one Ahhh that's why I recognised it! There is that one big question though. I really wonder how it will fly. https://i.imgur.com/o7DgMpC.gif I'm similar, my first born came a week after the first game came out.  I'm sitting there rocking my new daughter with my foot when i started up the game, by the time his daughter gets killed, im losing my shit locking doors and just sobbing, not knowing at all how to handle all my new emotions.  It still makes me think a lot.  Made me realize I would trade my soul and coukd be capable of awful things just to protect that little girl; something i hadnt considered before her birth. Did you also just find out that swans can be gay? > near perfect

No way man. If I've ever played a perfect videogame in every way possible, it was The Last of Us Blame all the dumbass people who complain that they don't want to watch a movie that they don't know exactly what it's about. Those are the same people who within the first 10 minutes of a movie starting complain that they're confused and don't know who everyone is.  Its thoughtful of them really Yep.  The first one was the only reason I bought a PS3. Don't forget to grab Bloodborne when you pick up your PS4. That was huge for me. How they created this PERFECT incarnation of a moral choice where the right thing and what's best for humanity comes down to a single choice. How many times we think that we would step left but everything in the entire game built up to a moment where it was so, absolutely crystal clear that the right path is the one we walked down. I didn't question Joel for a second in that last segment. 

I was legitimately speechless at the ending, just felt so agonizing in some ways. That's how you know it was real.  This one gets me every time, a vaccine would not save humanity at this point IMO. Most of the time the runners and clickers brutally grab the person and kill them rather than turn them. On top of that the fireflies are a group with an agenda, they would most likely use it as a weapon, like spread spores to military to eliminate them. Also since they have had people like Ellie before and they didn't just let her wake up and tell Joel this is what she wanted. The fireflies are shady as fuck so The decision like every decision Joel makes isn't black and white IMO The point is that humanity is doomed whether or not Ellie lives or dies. It comes down to who are really the bad guys? If we flushed out everyone with the parasites, humanity is still going to be evil. Joel realized this and made the choice figuring that Ellie's life wasn't going to be the end all for evil.  If you're the father of a little girl, his decision wasn't even controversial imo. If the choice was literally my girl's life or the human race, you'd have to take her from my dead hands. Maybe it's biology, I don't know. >He quite possibly doomed humanity, but you can barely fault him for doing it. 

Joel did not doom mankind, they were doing just fine when they were working together (like in that village halfway through the game).   It's the human who were causing their own misery in nearly every case.

I mean, yeah, the initial epidemic  killed people, like Ebola, like Black Death, but it's people fearing each other who turned everything to shit.    Ding. 

This is why they are bringing them back.  To be fair, Ellie could simply be evidence that humanity is slowly adapting to the spores. So while Joel may have made humanity suffer for a bit longer, there is still a high chance, imo anyway, that more people with Ellie's condition (brain change after being bitten or whatevs) will appear in the future. Not to mention in a post reveal interview they talked about how they were so dissatisfied with the stories they kept coming up with they almost gave up on a sequel all together because they refused to tell a story that would dilute the first game.

Which means if they're doing it they know they've hit on a really good narrative. This might be the best part of the ending. There are an unlimited number of valid reactions, and each are meaningful. The only way people don't feel about it is 'meh.' Everyone found it impactful. I was so excited when I didn't see anything. Nope. Brilliant. I'm so dumb. At first, I thought that she was performing in front of a crowd of people and then it showed her in an empty room then I thought that she was just performing in front of a crowd inside her head. I didn't realize until when Joel walked in that it wasn't supposed to be apart of the video.  When they see that firefly symbol, they know what it means, they know. Not sure why but when I see trailers for long awaited games/ movies like this with the audience exciting reaction it makes me teary eyed as fuck The moment the fireflies logo came into view people started losing their shit, I got goosebumps when I saw that. There's no "o" in audience



Edit: Just saw your name... woops Joel must be about 60 now. Shit. I mean, it makes sense. There's no set-up for anything else and the story is entirely contained, albeit open-ended. It very well could have been a one-off. >cut to black as the rest of humanity, minus Bill, is fucked.

~~FIFY~~ FTFY Why should the rest of humanity be more fucked than before? They didn't have a cure for the first 20 years and neither did they for the years after Part 1. 

It will just go on how it always did. Honestly that would be worst. If Ellie dies and it ends that Implies a Joel suicide.  That would be 2016 as a game. If Ellie dies, I will riot. Joel pulls a resnov? That's some M. Night Shyamalan shit right there, and not in the horrible way  You shut your whore mouth No Yep, every ghost I've seen carries a gun. That's how long it took me.  Notice how Joel just kinda materialises as he approaches the front door? Could definitely be a subtle clue hinting she is imagining it If this is the case, I hope they mind fuck us and lead us to believe he's actually alive and with you on your journey til plot twist: he's just in your head. Yes you are the only one to pick up on the shirt.

I think she literally just got done with killing all those people there, hence the shakey hands. http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/deleted-epilogue-scene-shown-last-us-one-night-live-event/ The free live action performance that Sony did a while back with the actors. They had an audience only scene that showed a epilogue of sorts for ellie and Joel. Although then mending their relationship is the first time I've heard of that.  One of us ^^^gooblegobblegooblegobble The Best of Us

Featuring The Foo Fighters Some More of Us the last of us 2: revengeance "They want a call sign."

"Uuuh, The Last of Us...The Last of Us part II." Aaand battle Firefly-ah. Oh! You can get the remastered trilogy for like 20 bucks. I got that same bundle, the trilogy, last of us remastered also came free, and until dawn for like 10 bucks, over it was only like 300 for everything and uncharted is one of my favorite series now [deleted] Maybe something nice? Like a home life sort of intro. It could be someone's birthday even!  Joel's daughter would like to have a word with you. Sounds like someone has the Walking Dead on their mind. Joel, not Rick.  Who's Rick? Rick Sanchez? I'm hard, and I'm not a guy Looking forward to this and the new God of war the most.  God I forgot about that game, I loved Heavy Rain so much.

and I can't believe I was considering trading in my PS4! So... It's not a new Uncharted. Set in India. India is very rich in mythology and mysteries so will work as a perfect place for their adventure. They also called the hangover sequel part 2 so you never know I guess that's true. If it was any other company I'd be afraid. But ND really knows their shit. So I can't help but feel pumped. Exactly, and if there's any company I'd trust with story it's naughty dog. Old friends is the best way to put it. I was very against a sequel because the first one meant so much to me but seeing Joel and Ellie again put a huge smile on my face. Not sure what other position they would be in, other than fighting, in a part 2 to be fair. RAMPAAAAGEEE Ellie goes brick fucking MASTER. Streaming ahahaha, get a load of this guy LOUD NOISES  MY CAPS LOCK HASN'T COME OFF SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT #***SHOUTING INTENSIFIES*** RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!!! It's way more fun without it, trust me. I just used patience and camera angles and it was a ton of fun... the whole radar thing didn't seem to fit the game. Joel's not a clicker! That's Grounded Mode (the hardest difficulty)

No radar, less ammo, smarter enemies.  Don't die Don't try to fight the clickers.  Sneak right past them.  Wait for bill to unlock the door.  Get through the door, and you are in the clear.  There are a lot of points in that game where complete stealth is the best course of action. bricks/bottles are your best friends when you run out of other options. 

honestly, bricks are like... 90% of grounded mode.  Don't waste the pipe, we need it for the clickers! Not a chance.

Saying Naughty Dog has good writing is like saying water is wet. Uncharted 3. Parts of it. Naughty Dog is my favorite studio at this point and Uncharted is my favorite series but Uncharted 3 was just a mess, story wise.  Like some sort of ghost. He could be dead for all we know at that point in the reveal trailer. Yeah seeing as he shows up to a slaughter looking fresh and sounding really calm and Asking "are you really gonna go through with this" It's the numbers, Mason! I feel like that would be a really cheap twist... Reznov all over again There's always a lighthouse. There's always a man. There's always a city. Thanks for ruining the game. :(  That's some Call of Duty Black Ops shit lol. I love it. Where do you think we are ellie?
 Found the Arkham Knight writer Looking forward to it u wot m8, ill rip u up  Get a promotion  Got my ticket punched.

*edit: Apparently, now it's a "golden ticket".  Choo choo! Bro job, bro job...wait, what were we talking about again? Oh yeah, can't wait for this game. One ticket please 🎫 I bought it when it came out but insisted on playing it on the hardest difficulty and uh..  didn't get far.  I finally played it again a month ago, seriously one of the best game I've ever played.   Those clever fucks didn't go for my predicted title of: "The Last of Us 2" to avoid the pun on purpose.   That's true. I definitely think it'll be very good, but I'm going to be working on lowering my expectations for it because I don't want to be disappointed if I hope for the best and "only" get a great game. Just spit-balling here (and tagging just in case); [I think the people she killed in the house there were Fireflies. The framing makes it seem like their mark was on a stop sign outside the house and it was their territory. My guess is that Joel tells her the truth pretty early in the game (first third at least) and then the full story along with new information we get makes her want to kill them all](/spoiler) Perfect. Damn you beat me to it lmao I agree completely. Finishing TLOU was the only time I've ever thought "I just played a perfect game." It really was amazing it's the on the pedestal with Portal 2 and the Half Life series. The story telling is flawless. Still remember the what is the matrix commercials and only seeing some short clip of trinity in the air before seeing it.  I mean that reveal was awesome >  Those are the same people who within the first 10 minutes of a movie starting complain that they're confused and don't know who everyone is.

God this makes me rage internally. 

"NO I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS, I WATCHED EXACTLY AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE!!!!!!!!" Yep, me too, and I never played much else on it. Crazy how Sony basically got me to pay $400 to play a single game. Pretty much the same here.  Just finished Bloodborne and I haven't had that much fun in a while. And stress...that too Literally the two games that made me buy a PS4 Eh, that depends on how you did it I think.

I perfect stealthed the last bit, didn't kill anyone and got into the operating room unseen.   My logic was that "holy shit that's a lot of machine guns", so I thought I was supposed to do that.

Turns out most people just killed everyone including the surgeons and nurses, and I feel like killing the doctors was kind of unnecessary.  But, in retrospect, I think killing absolutely everyone was the canon ending. I absolutely question Joel's decision . Ellie had made a choice, and he stole that from her.  Not for her, but because he himself couldn't stand losing her.  He possibly betrayed the world to save Ellie, but ultimately, he betrayed Ellie to save himself.  Which is why he lies to her in the final moments of the game. Seems to me the primary threat of infection comes from airborne spores rather than direct contact with infected. A vaccine would be hugely helpful. Or hold the vaccine for ransom Replaying it, they do point out in the beginning that some people get infected just from spores growing in their homes.  The spores might keep spreading--in that case, a vaccine might be the only way. > Also since they have had people like Ellie before and they didn't just let her wake up and tell Joel this is what she wanted

They really did have others like Ellie? I thought that Joel made that up completely. How the heck did they think they were going to make a vaccine out of nowhere? 

Do you know how long it takes to design a vaccine vector and test it?!? Factoring in their lack of manpower or infrastructure... impossible! Especially as it was just the fireflies. I think the only way would be as a collaborative effort with several governments around the world. Assuming the rest of the world has a surviving population. I think saving Ellie was the right choice as well. Was humanity meant to be saved? Think about all the bad people you met in the game, then think about the good people. Two black guys, and one camp. The rest wanted to do the worst to you.  Oh, I bet the fireflies came in and killed everyone where Ellie and Joel were staying, trying to get her back.  And now she wants revenge. Wait. I thought the "had immune people," was part of Joel's lie. No one had shown immunity before Ellie. Unless I missed something. I saw it as more of a conflict of ideologies between Joel and Ellie, and the whole cure thing is just the backdrop. Everybody Ellie cared about was killed by the infected (apart from Marlene, but she doesn't know that), and she sees dying for the sake of possibly finding a cure as like her calling. She's willing to sacrifice herself to get rid of the infected. 

Joel on the other hand, everybody he cares about is killed by humans. They kill his daughter, Tess, and they would have killed Ellie too if he hadn't intervened. So his only real purpose is just to hold onto *something* that people can't take from him, whatever the cost. 

So in the end, even if the main characters don't fully realize it themselves, the main conflict is Ellie's selflessness vs. Joel's selfishness. And of course Joel wins completely. There's a little ambiguity at the end about whether she believes his story or not, but either way it's a pretty tragic ending for Ellie IMO. 

So yeah at the heart of it I see it as just a deeply personal story about the differences between those two characters (bear in mind also that Ellie has probably lost at least as many people she loves as Joel has) and the whole apocalypse thing was just a stage for it to play out on. As far as the story is concerned, what happens to humanity doesn't really matter. :) Yeah that's the background of Joel decision, specially after seeing the game introduction.  I think an interesting plot narrative would be that he dies while trying in some form or another to tell her the truth about her. Literally just bought a 100 ps4 pros because of this brilliance. Same here, I thought she was on a stage singing to people. IIRC he had his daughter early, and he didn't go to college? So he was probably ~50 during the first game, late 40s? >buttfuckit

- Bill, 2033 >~~FIFY~~ FTFY

FTFY The first game explored how many younger people prolly wouldn't survive post-outbreak. I could imagine there being a scenario where Ellie is one of the very few her age who actually survived.  Not that they even know for sure if they can reverse-engineer Ellie into a cure, which is one of the reasons why the first game ended like it did. Yeah, and even with a cure I think it's too late for most of them anyway. (not saying a cute is a bad thing, but it won't fix everything) Without the torture of course. ALL MUST DIE and on top of that, he looks like he didn't just fight and kill those people. He looks clean and unscathed, not like the brutal Joel we see throughout the first one. Plus, he'd be a few years older and is bound to be slower, which makes him being unharmed less likely. 
 Then Bruce Willis shows up asking for work. I thought that was just a scene of Joel teaching Ellie the guitar? The Last of Us 2: Episode 2 Yeah he was mid to late 40s in the last of us. His hair was already graying in that time. Several years later and he looks the same.   Heck they could even go for a drive through town!  Coral's dad Me Sploosh Sort of. It's a standalone DLC Don't say that ever again.  Look what Uncharted 2 did for Uncharted. Then look what Uncharted 4 did to Uncharted 3. Do not doubt Neil Druckmann. The Last of Us Part II: Guitar Lessons Archer.... Archer... ARCHER Maaaaaannnn I still havent finished the game...idk maybe Im a pansy but this game is soooooo intense!

 I have to play it in waves...the skyscraper...the underground subway...I cant just marathon it, much less without the sensor geez, bravo! Also in my opinion the hardest(/best) part about Grounded Mode was there being no HUD at all. You literally needed to count every shot so you know when to reload, and you don't know your health at all until you're critically low and Joel starts holding his arm. Not that you could survive more than one hit at full health anyway lol it worked! I so hated Bill because he always somehow managed to startle clickers. Not Ellie though. She could touch them and nothing but Bill.. well, that's whole other story. It made me hate that character, lol. Yupp, crash bandicoot 1-3 had me on a knives edge from start to finish  I don't think they've ever "blew it", but Uncharted 3's story was very mediocre. Graphics, VA, and gameplay were incredible, but the story was meh.  the story was a mess but all the returning characters were fine in it, it was just the ideas and the badguys that ruined in the terms of not ruining the arc of TLOU1 i think they can do that just fine Fair enough but aren't the people who made TLOU and UC4 different from those who made UC1-3? (Same studio of course, but different teams w/in ND, right?) If Uncharted 3 is the worst Naughty Dog can do, I think we're safe. That was still one of the games of the year *Dragovich, Kravchenko, Steiner, ALL must die* WHAT DO THEY MEAN!? [deleted] All aboard  Playing on the harder difficulties is really fun though. Trying to figure out how to escape the hotel basement with one bullet and no items was intense "The Last 2 of Us" The Matrix had one of the very few marketing campaigns I'd like to experience again for the first time. That shit was tight. They made an experience out of it. The campaign for that film was better than a lot of films. and it was worth every cent! Don't forget to grab Uncharted 4 when you pick up your PS4.    Me too. I ended the game with a completely full inventory lol.  The thing is though, you have to wonder if it would truly be Ellie's choice, or if she would make the choice because she felt obligated to do so. Saving humanity at the cost of your own life is a heavy burden for a 14yo kid. 

Obviously, Joel loves her and had his own personal reasons to lie to her at the end as, but I also feel that he did not let her make her own decision because, ultimately, it wouldn't really be her decision. It's easy for us to say that a single life is a small price to pay, but I don't blame Joel for not wanting to force that sacrifice upon her.

Besides, there was no guarantee that the experiments would even successfully create an effective vaccine that could be mass-produced. And even if it did, the fireflies proved themselves to be a shady bunch. Think of the power to be had by controlling the production and distribution of such a vaccine!

The humanity that Ellie could have maybe, possibly saved, perhaps, would then be at the whim and mercy of the fireflies. Maybe he believes that humanity doesn't deserve a savior. If the likelihood of success was there.  They already killed at least 6 other immune people based on the notes. You guys didn't find it odd that the "crowd of people" were cheering long before Ellie showed up? Or how they were especially loud during the Firefly and Naughty Dog logos? The Last of Us II: *American Idol* JOEL NEEDS A CAR, DAMMIT And only because she's immune. She can walk through spore clouds without a mask (barring suffocation) and can survive being bit/scratched by the infected. Did it? Tommy had a whole town of families that had kids. Just because it didn't show them didn't mean they weren't there.  I was really looking forward to the strangle/shiv/torture feature  I don't think he did fight all those people - Ellie did. He just came looking for her. We did it reddit! We almost found the boston bomber, we've declared war on isis and created to fappening, and now we've completely played through and gotten the platinum trophy on a game thats just been announced for quite possible 2019!

..danger zone  If you marathon it and get to the Giraffes, it makes that scene so much more worth it because you actually feel relieved you're not running from anything / killing things.

I need to go cry now... Yeah I'm with you. I beat the game but not till the PS4 version got announced so I plugged in my old PS3 and got a copy for 10 bucks. It was so good but so intended that I could only ever play for an hour or two at a time. I found fighting people to be tough at times but atleast there wasn't those freaky ass clickers! Should try beating grounded with only melee Crash.. bring me those crystalsssss.

Goosebumps just thinking about it. Character writing in 3 was fine, it was the plot that was just messy, full of dropped subplots and made no narrative sense sometimes. Oh TLOU will be amazing and I would trust Naughty Dog with anything. I'd even play a game about lesbian dinosaurs in space if they were the ones to make it. Just pointing out that Uncharted 3 missed the mark (and my biggest issue with the narrative was the backwards and inconsistent character development).  Yeah, Uncharted 1 and 2 were made by the same team, with the addition of Amy Hennig as the lead writer. Uncharted 3 comes along, ND splits into two teams - Neil and TLOU team, and Amy/Evan and the UC3 team. Amy ends up leaving during UC3's production. For UC4, you have the entire team back together, sans Amy, with Neil as the creative director. 

At least, that's to the best of my recollection. I may have gotten a few details wrong.  Opening 15 minutes of the original might be my favorite of any game ever. This shit is one of the only games I will ever pre-order. Beyond stoked.  Wtf is this automatic? Oh, I remember that one.

If I remember that one correctly you can't beeline for the generator because they will get you as you're starting it, so what you had to do was run up the stairs on the right and then jump down to it again, you'd have a few seconds to get it running before you had to sprint out of there like Usain Bolt on PCP.

My butt was clenched all the way through. Fuck that level and the sewer.  They can rot in hell.  I started on the hardest difficulty for the first playthrough and that was a real experience. I loved playing it that way since it did feel like a true survival experience.  Playing the game on any other difficulty, except maybe the one right below it just felt like cheating.  2 Last 2 Us 2 Last 2 Us Literally the three games that made me buy a PS4. Plus the whole idea of finding a cure is wrapped up in the idea of putting the world back the way it was before the outbreak, when the game really goes in depth showing you that even if the clicker's vanished the next day there was no going back.   *tips revolver* That's what decided it for me. The scientists seemed mostly incompetent. Some people are just really stupid. & Knuckles  The Last of Us: The Squeakquel The half of life 3 And a visit from the neighbor! 5 button please.  No more 3+3 Nah. I did this with the runners before the school and in the school I only used like two arrows to take out the clickers. But idk how it would even be possible to kill that bloater in the gym.
 If Nitrous Brio wasn't the greatest plot twist in gaming history during Crash 2, I don't know what humanity has left in regards to narrative excellence. AFAIK everything is right except Amy left during Uncharted 4's production. Neil and co. had to redo most of the story and they had to recast (presumably Sam, although we don't know who that was in the first trailer) and Rafe. That's why Uncharted 4 was delayed so many times. Opening 8-9 hours of the original might be my favourite game ever.  I want to kick in the nuts whoever was chopping onions in the room when I finished that opening bit. The voice acting and art direction and facial animations. It's damn timeless. ND doesn't go photo realistic but you can see how timeless the art is in the game.

That opening was something truly special So, probably a bad time to admit I've had it on PS3 since release and I think I'm about an hour in 3-4 years later?

I was actually thinking about digging the PS3 out the other day to play it seeing as my Xbox One has basically become a Netflix box. Nah. My butt was clenched for like 40% of that game TLOU is a great game. TLOU on the hardest difficulty is one of the fucking best games ever made 2 Last 2 Us Joelectric Boogellie. The Last Guardian? Don't forget to grab Knack when you get your PS4. This has been my argument for a while now. I wouldn't have been surprised one bit if the Fireflies uses the cure to just gain power over others. And how would they even disburse the cure to people around the world, let alone the country? Aw :( *Ellie's guitar music fades*

*Freeze frame*

*Voice over of Ellie*

"You're probably wondering how I got here. You're probably thinking, 'Why is there a dead body on the floor?', 'Why does she have a tattoo?', and 'Where did she get the guitar from?'. Well me and that guitar - we go way back..."

*cue intro where you avoid Mushroom Zombies in a shopping mall and happen upon a guitar*
 I think that delaying to make sure your game is as good as it possibly can be is the best way to go about video game development. A lot of games nowadays seem to follow the model of "release the beta, and we'll hotfix it later". Do you not like the rest of it? Genuinely curious as to where the cut off is.  Maybe I don't understand photorealism in games or something but that sure as shit looked photorealistic to me. Also I just watched The Road last night and this game looks like that movie. It's interesting--I guess it's post apocalyptic? We need a post ap story where human beings improve society and come closer. Fuck it, I'm writing that shit. Do it! It is currently one of the only games that has gotten me 100% emotionally involved with the characters. To the point where when Joel was angry I was angry. Mine was wide open. The other 60% was moving ladders Oh yeah, hanging upside down was intense as fuck as well. 2 Last 2 Furious And God of War!  LUL Also "Winter" might be one of the most amazing acts in a game ever. There are only three games my wife has ever been into. And by been into, I mean she wanted to watch me play them. They are TWD: Ep 1, Ep 2, and The Last of Us.  She loved the first, and demanded that I didn't play while she wasn't around.

It took a week longer than it should have, but it was worth it to finally have my wife enjoy a video game. Same. You wouldn't believe what fell out of there.
 Just the 2 of us 2 Last 4 U 2 Last 2 Furi-Us 2 Brothers....its just called 2 brothers! Haha Except that is an Xbox 360 case...  Xb1 and PS4 are already smaller to follow bluray.  Just bought the patent on square box extenders to help your new cases fit into your current DVD/CD racks. Well actually they're smaller than DVD cases now..... Nintendo did something cool with their 3DS cases. There are small squares throughout that reduce the amount of plastic used to make the case. It allows them to keep their standard sized cases but still remove material. Of course the Switch will probably use cases the size of the DS and 3DS cases because cartridges. Just buying a digital download saves the most plastic! I think they look like that to maximise space for artwork and therefore presence on a store shelf, not necessarily VHS related. Way to come with the snark like a whole console generation late... In case you haven't noticed Blu ray cases are already just barely larger than the disc, with just about a half inch of plastic above the sleeve for branding purposes, and Xbox One and PS4(actually starting with the PS3) have always used Blu Ray cases. Even worse is when you get a physical case and it only has a cdkey.

http://i.imgur.com/fKGZq4D.jpg Why is the US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches? That’s an exceedingly odd number.

Why was that gauge used?

Because that’s the way they built them in England, and English expatriates built the US Railroads.

Why did the English build them like that?

Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that’s the gauge they used.

Why did “they” use that gauge then?

Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing.

Okay! Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?

Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that’s the spacing of the wheel ruts.

So who built those old rutted roads?

Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (and England) for their legions. The roads have been used ever since.

And the rut they the roads?

Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were made for Imperial Rome, theywere all alike in the matter of wheel spacing.

The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is derived from the original specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot. And bureaucracies live forever. So the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse’s ass came up with it, you may be exactly right, because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two
war horses. Like Nintendo DS games? So you're saying... that we should put games on VHS casettes? CDs used to come in these [cardboard longboxes](http://webzoom.freewebs.com/trailblazer/New13/ridepic1-large.jpg) so music stores can display them on their vinyl record shelves. The record labels realized they would save $25,000,000 per year if they just stopped producing the longboxes. Like the Playstation 1 cases? But where are you supposed to store your PS2 memory cards then??  If we're going to bother with physical media at all, we should go back to [old school PC game cardboard boxes, with fold-out artwork and real manuals.]( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTZD1zcZLPBu8NHu-S66IqwEEo8mnhXCRi7G0ZUqd3mfR353FKskA) The larger size sort of made sense when they game with actual manuals...now...not really so much. game boxes are so flimsy these days they barely protect the disc. You could probably step on a gamecube case and the disc would still be fine Just stop making optical media....

Put everything on cartridges again, because flash storage is so cheap now, for both games and storage.

It would lead to better performance and nearly all metrics I can think of, such as: read/write speeds, susceptibility to damage, packaging/shipping size, size of required hardware, reliability of the required hardware and so many more things. I mean you also had like 30 page game manuals in the past that fit in those little tabs. But I feel like every physical game I've bought recently has resembled the one on the right, so I think they are switching. Set-up costs to make the new case might be higher but suppliers are already making them, so why not save on material costs.

But you do have to account for marketing and printing on the case, which become tougher with a smaller area. I think this whole point is relatively moot because we're moving toward digital anyway. Nah. I like the full size cases. Gives room for those who chose to still include a manual to do so and gives more room for interesting box art.  or we could eliminate plastic by simply downloading games. This isn't even close to a noteworthy amount of plastic lost. Other applications waste thousands of times more than this. I actually love the larger packaging. Bring back laserdisc! And then there are Nintendo DS cases... Could we not change AGAIN? My game shelf already looks like a fucking equalizer. The smaller case reminds people of a CD and people don't buy CDs anymore. Someone also needs to make smaller game racks. Better thing will to offer a discount to Allow people to Download. They can get Tax Credits for going Green and sell more copies as used market dies out. Not saying they should take away physical copies because some people like to collect/don't have high speed internet still. Can't tell you how many times I don't play PS4 because I have to "Insert the Disc."  Movie posters are also that shape, and game covers have been that shape for most of the industries history.

From a purely aesthetic perspective it still makes sense. On a similar note, can we stop selling games via digital download for the same full retail price as physical copies? There's no manufacturing and nearly no labor costs of any other kind involved. It's called the Golden Ratio. For some reason, the ratio of height to depth is pleasing to the human eye. And its mathematical roots can be linked to the fibonacci sequence, which occurs all over the place in nature in the form of spirals.

It's not about functionality, just pleasing design. Like, I understand why DVD cases are the shape they are... Yea sure whatever.  BUT!!!

GAME CASES USED TO BE CD CASES!  Lets go back to that guys.  It'll be easier to ship if they are the size of a CD and there are 80 bajilion ways to store CDs... Lets fucking do this.  seriously.  I'd be so damn happy. Hrmmm..  Not sure this is the lowest hanging fruit to chase if you're after saving the environment.


People don't exactly buy a game, yank out the disc, and throw away the rest of the packaging.  That packing lives on for quite a long time normally.  If gaming does impact the environment so badly, don't shoot for a ~25% reduction in a plastic case..  Quit gaming and focus all of those extra hours of humanity on it.


As you state, the cases were made like this to maintain compatibility with how folks stored their predecessor and not require us to throw out and repurchase storage cabinets/etc because we bought a new console.  If there were more rapid case redesigns, folks would be throwing out the containers more quickly.  A better scenario to focus on would be those single manufacturers that are intentionally making the new offering require throwing every peripheral out, with significant impact, like Apple.  

I know I'm ranting and you mean well, so overall kudos to your intentions. It's already [like that](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia1.gameinformer.com%2Ffilestorage%2FCommunityServer.Components.SiteFiles%2Fimagefeed%2Ffeatured%2Fmicrosoft2013%2Fxbox-one%2FXboxOneCaseFlipDisc.jpg&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bianoti.com%2Fgallery-xbox-one-game-case-back.html&docid=KKHclhwnghZrBM&tbnid=oR9QKGPBOnKphM%3A&vet=1&w=610&h=458&client=ms-android-hms-tmobile-us&bih=518&biw=360&ved=0ahUKEwjxyZfu79DQAhXnqlQKHcBzAkgQMwhlKC8wLw&iact=mrc&uact=8) I like how they save plastic by leaving holes in cases instead of shrinking them—making cases weak and easy to damage.

I like the bluray case size. It's a good size for a booklet. So CD cases? This guy is going to go mad when he sees the inside of a DS game case...  No. If you heathens want to save space, download your games, but don't *fuck* with the cases. I already have to deal with flimsy WiiU and 3DS cases with giant holes cut out of the flimsy recycled plastic. You know the result? Art inserts that gets bent out of shape, and I always feel like I'm about to break the cases! Also means finding games in *decent* shape will be nearly impossible in a few years when your mom donates them to a goodwill or something.

Also, what you're proposing here is YET ANOTHER variant in case design. *Why?!* These will be too thick to fit in a standard CD rack, (not that you kids remember what *those* are,) and they'll take up exactly the same space on my DVD racks as a standard sized DVD case. Why not just use Blu-ray cases? That's a happy medium right? It already exists, and you can still fit decent sized manuals in them, right? 

Speaking of, do you know how much it costs to make a decent manual? About 5 to 10 damn cents per copy of the game. How much money do you think they'll *really* save on paper and ink by decreasing the size of the art? We should be demanding MORE from our $60 purchases, not less. ...as you throw your 3rd K-cup in the garbage.  remind me why games still come on a piece of plastic in a piece of plastic to begin with? i'm never looking back from digital downloads.  Um... that's already what Sony started doing for PS3 cases and what Microsoft started doing for XBO cases. You've got a picture of the old 360 cases from the previous generation.

https://www.blogcdn.com/www.joystiq.com/media/2006/11/first-ps3-game-case-shots-2.jpg

Note the PS2 box in the back is the tall case like the one you mentioned whereas the small box in the front is the ps3 case. It isn't as close to the disk as your example but it's pretty close.

PS4 open case: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8xPXdWqVMhI/maxresdefault.jpg For fuck sake at least keep it consistent. I have like 4 sizes of boxes on my shelf and it looks gross (ocd). Ps1 had small cases. Cases have been smaller for like 4 years now, what is this post? Actually I hope consoles will go back to cartage based games. 

Some reasons cartridges are better than disks:

---

Flash memory keeps getting cheaper

Disks are easy to damage

Cartridges can read faster than disks

Game cartage are easy to store

Cartage design has no moving parts so they are silent

A blu-ray dual layer disk can hold at most 50 Gb

A pocket USB stick can easily be more than a few 100 Gb

Removing Disk drives would allow consoles be a bit smaller

The main reason most game company moved away from cartridges in the first place was the lack of disk space, and that is not a issue anymore.

---

I'm sure I missed some but those are the ones that I thought of off the top of my head. Sony actually started with the PS3. Nintendo is the only one sticking with large [keep cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_case).

It's also worth noting that the PS2 and GameCube keep cases sometimes held memory cards, so it wasn't so much as a waste of space for those two. Which is as it should be. They should follow the standard so we don't have a clusterfuck of different sizes for our media. They are still larger than they need to be though And Nintendo does cut outs on the front and around the disk to use less plastic. It's cheaper to make a bunch of cases if they're using less plastic. I'd like to subscribe to your news letter. But OP made them CD sized. It would fit in old CD racks Yup that is the only reason they are made to that size spec.  I am all digital so I can share with my other consoles. Just like the long boxes that CDs used to be sold in. 2 CDs=1 LP Aren't they just Blu-ray cases now? I love what they did with the Kid Icarus Uprising case. They used those squares in the inside dealing of the case. I wish they do that in more games.
http://pictures.nintendofanatic.com/kid-icarus-3ds-inside-game-case.jpg [Pretty sure theyve been doing this with DVD cases for a long while now too.](http://xbox360media.ign.com/xbox360/image/article/105/1050097/microsoft-goes-green-with-new-xbox-360-cases-20091127091917336.jpg) They could do that AND have smaller cases and save even more waste... [deleted] I hope they go with something closer to Vita cases. I don't know why, but those cases are adorable.  But muh trades But that's the thing. You are not actually buying a digital download. You're buying a limited license that allows you to play it for as long as they allow it. With a physical copy, I own that copy. I have something to lend to my friends, give to my kids, sell when I am done with it, or donate to goodwill. I may be an old fart fighting the inevitable march of progress, but I still cling to my first sale doctrine rights. I still buy physical music, books, and games whenever I have the option. I dislike Digital Download.

1. PS4 wifi adapter is terrible. Takes hours/days to download a game.

2. Lose your account = Lose all your games

3. Digital almost never goes down in price except during sales. GTA V still costs the full 70$ on the PSN store.

4. No nice game collection on shelf. Also I like to actually hold something I own in my hands.

5. Can't lend games to friends. You're obviously not from Myanmar.  Look at mr. "My internet isn't terrible" over here I would like to see a comparison of materials, cost to produce, and impact on the environment of dvds (cases, booklets, and dvd player included) vs digital copies (servers, systems, and electricity included).  basically everything needed to produce and play a dvd vs. everything needed to produce and play a digital copy.  The bridge for the comparison could be impact vs data storage.  I have a feeling digital will be better over all, but i would like to see actual stats to back that up. Am I the only one who gets a mini-high from the new game smell when I open the case the first time?  Eh I learned that because i don't have Internet at home I can't play my digital games on ps4. :/  Well back in the day those tabs inside the case used to hold what were called "manuals" that you would read ten times over because Christmas was at grandma's house and your PS2 was at home.  And i had to scroll all the way down to find the only obvious reason. 

It's all about the presentation in a store.  It also mimicks the aspect ratio of most movie posters. You never see a movie poster that's just a square. Probably a bit of both. VHS tapes are not the same size as DVD cases at all. But it makes sense when you think of storage options, marketing trends, and presence. I know when we started buying DVDs they fit fine on our VHS shelf, but not quite the same.  How do people not realize this? I haven't bought a DVD sized case in 7 years probably.. yeah this entire thread is just stupid 

You're all 3 years late  You forget that this is reddit, and this is probably a repost from years ago with the title reworded to be relevant today. To be fair the proposed case is still smaller than the current Blu-ray case form. Those are still rectangular and the proposed case is square, still around 20% in plastic savings. Probably not as front page material as this post has gained, but still better. 
 No CD whatsoever? I would be so pissed. The reason I buy disc games is because of my internet speed being shite. What the fuck is even the point?

Why not just sell it as a scratch off card or something. Damn, thats just belligerent. Titanfall 2?  And that's why the challenger exploded. The initial booster design was wider than the final, but they were assembled off site and had to be transported via train to cape Canaveral. The tunnels were made just big enough to fit a train car through, smaller than the initial booster design. So the engineers had to slim them down and in the redesign missed the flaw that caused the explosion. So the Romans killed the challenger crew. http://www.snopes.com/history/american/gauge.asp

Edit: Not sure why the gold, but thanks. Incidentally, Spanish railroads have a different spacing from the rest of Europe to further dissuade a French invasion. Just like how barns are red because stars die.  >And the rut they the roads?

"ruh roh" --Scooby Doo Wow, do we have some OC TIL here folks?

*Guess it wasn't obvious...but /s Hi guys. I was really amazed by this and promptly fact checked this and - sadly - its not true. 

http://www.snopes.com/history/american/gauge.asp

Edit: also OP's comment is copy-pasted from this apparent "email from 2000" cited, nearly word-for-word in this link.

Edit 2: /u/philphan25 and others have already posted this isn't true. I don't think I had an email in 2000... so first time I saw this. Thanks for that wonderful post!  I was expecting this to end with a joke where you made it all up. That is really interesting.
 That reminds me of how some stores like K-Mart replaced them with these long anti-theft extender things. When you bought a CD the kid working at the counter had to remove the device for you so you could bring it home.  The [original](http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9677a3d130f28722c268d282014e66cf-650-80.jpg) Playstation cases were monstrous at the beginning. 

ctrl+f "ps2 memory card"

My man. I loved the manuals, fold out poster, everything that came with the game. It was like getting a gift pack with every game.  Damn straight
 The manuals were sized to fit the case. Look at PS1 cases/manuals, for an example. Manuals are the thing I miss most about console gaming. I loved reading the manuals on the way home from the game store when I was a kid :( They had little story elements, tips and tricks, etc.  Your foot though? Trip to the hospital. 
 Do you remember PlayStation 2 cases? You could whack a memory card in the space above the disc. Those were the good old days. Can't they make a smaller manual? But they can still give manuals?  Ps1 did manuals just fine with small jewel cases. ^^I ^^buy ^^CD's. It's one step further: because no one buys CDs anymore the whole CD packaging industry has wound down which means it's just plain cheaper and easier to locally source Blu Ray boxes for your dozens of pressing plants across the world.  But people do buy games. And smaller cases aren't going to make people not buy games. I buy cds... Not going to point on how much truth there actual is in the Golden Ratio. Just point out that the GR is 1.62 (2dp) so a DVD case with a width of 135 mm should be about 219 mm in height, which is about 29 mm more than modern DVD cases. Weird then that almost no physical games are delivered in that ratio anymore. Nintendo agrees with you.  Nintendo are going cartridge/digital for the next console, so we should get small boxes again. They had room for the memory cards, but I have never known games that came with memory cards. It's just who sets the standard, anyone can come up with a slimmer case, but it won't force anybody to adapt  But don't most bluray cases have two discs? The bluray and the DVD copy? Rather have the case be smaller with a thicker plastic because I hate those cut plastic pnes.  They feel that like they're going to break.

You've subscribed to Cat Facts, Text Meow to 6969 to get more cat facts! Just bought a company that distributes news letters they'll look nice next to my Dreamcast games Why not just use a music CD storage rack then? Just make the game cases the same dimensions as those.  PS4 and Xbone use Blu-ray disks, so yes. Many of the earlier 3DS games have that like
 
MGS 3D

Virtue's Last Reward

NSMB2

Super Mario 3D Land

Starfox 64

(These are just the ones I found in my Collection of ~25 3DS Games)

They just stopped doing that around the same time they stopped printing manuals.   Underrated game. I'm truly hoping for a sequel. Hopefully we won't have to wait 25 years again.  those suck compared to the nintendo ones but that is because nintendo uses thicker plastic and the cases don't bend to all hell Yes, but I imagine retailers won't let them go any smaller.  You need enough surface area on the package to draw consumers' eyeballs, and if the package gets too small, it gets too easy for thieves to sneak them out of a store.   Check out Japan region GameCube cases. Those things are awesome My bigger concern isn't trades but the fact that owning a license to a game instead of a physical copy means you're subject to terms and conditions from Sony/Microsoft/etc. If that account gets locked out/banned for any reason, your inventory is just gone.  I look at it more as "but muh ability to loan the game to friends."

And unless there are sales, the physical product is usually cheaper than the digital if it's not a brand new game.

Edit: I should state I mean console gaming (ps4 for me specifically). PC gamers generally always can find great prices with sales. How else am I gonna save 20 bucks on a ps4 pro? My digital copy of black ops 3 can't be traded in at my local gamestop  But muh datacaps!  Don't preorder and don't buy day one, wait for sale, buy for real cheap and you won't care about trade in value. Check out GoG then if you have a PC. No DRM, you buy games, you own them and you can do what you want with it! [deleted] > You're buying a limited license that allows you to play it for as long as they allow it.

That's true of a CD, too. [deleted] Consoles have it rough. Almost all your points are not a thing on PC. Not trying to flaunt anything but I really hate how Sony and MS (and Nintendo) handle digital downloads. It sucks that they hinder their digital stores so they can continue to support physical copy sales at B&M stores. Only hurts the customer in the end. Yeah wtf is up with that? 
I Download games on steam and origin at 20mb/s. But God forbid I download something on my ps4. Oh, yeah? And you're obviously not from Trinidad and Tobago. [It'll always be Burma to me, Elaine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAlinvw2Rb0) took me 14 hours to download Battlefield 1. i feel you. I saw something like that years ago. I think it came out to 70% of a physical game cost goes to production, materials, shipping, retail cut, etc., and on a digital game via Steam, it's 6-7%. I'll try to find some hard numbers and edit them in if I find anything. Don't own a Wii U? Their cases are standardized to DVD cases.

Not trying to help OP's awful post's argument but it's not like ALL the current consoles use the Bluray cases. None. I just bought BF1 "Physical Copy" because it was on sale but the digital copy was full price. A case arrived with a key and instructions to download it Nope, just a paper with the key. The case doesn't' even have the cd retainer bit so you just near worthless plastic shell.  [deleted] Yup, finished the campaign last night and enjoyed it thoroughly  I'm sure you're aware of this, but engineers didn't "miss" the flaw (at least not forever). The higher-ups were grossly negligent of a flaw that they were repeatedly warned about by the engineers and that's why the challenger blew up. So you're saying if Romans had fatter horses then the challenger wouldn't have exploded? 

Damn skinny-ass horses. Nobody challenges the Romans and lives to tell about it. > TL;DR about railroad tracks

> And that's why the challenger exploded

Well now I guess I *have* to read that. That's mostly incorrect. 

Many people agree on a major event that led to the challenger explosion was due to the engineering team failing to pitch a good enough case to stop the launch based on the risk of O-ring degradation at low temperatures. They had the statistics and plenty of data from previous launches and **PREVIOUS O-ring failure case studies**

More of a mental exercise: Edward Tufte (an expert on information visualization and visualization aesthetics) has a fantastic case study that exhibits the poor aesthetic choices made when constructing the warning charts and the improper arrangement of information that clearly failed to convey the actual risk on the engineering danger that was well documented but not properly pitched to the people who had the authority to reschedule and cancel rocket launches.

Nobody "missed" the flaw that blew up the challenger. The right people just didn't listen.

 Not even the lord can do anything about chariots.

> Judges 1:19 Now the LORD was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots.  >So the Romans killed the challenger crew.

/r/nocontext  Not really sure why the conclusion there was "false". The article itself seems to be saying it's actually mostly true, just that some of the details are a bit more complicated than the story makes them out to be, and that this particular outcome wasn't inevitable. Is it just me, or do they talk about how it's pretty much true, and then label it false after calling it 'unremarkable' and quibbling about insignificant details and the degree to which it can be called a direct and inevitable connection?

> **isn't completely false** in an overall sense and is perhaps more fairly labeled as **"Partly true, but for trivial and unremarkable reasons."**  Marveling that the width of modern roadways is similar to the width of ancient roadways is **sort of like getting excited over a notion along the lines of "modern clothes sizes are based upon standards developed by medieval tailors." Well, duh.** Despite obvious differences in style, clothing in the Middle Ages served the same purpose as clothing today (i.e., to cover, protect, and ornament the human body), and modern human beings are very close in size to medieval human beings (we are, on average, a little bit taller and heavier than we were several centuries ago, but not so much), so we naturally expect ancient and modern clothing to be similar in 
size. 

> So, rather than going into excruciating detail about the history of transportation, **we'll simply note that roads are built to accommodate whatever uses them, and that for many centuries prior to the advent of railroads, what traveled on roads were mostly wheeled conveyances, pulled by beasts of burden (primarily horses)**

&nbsp;

> When confronted with a new idea such as a "rail," why go to the expense and effort of designing a new vehicle to use on it rather than simply adapting ones already in abundant use on roadways? Wouldn't it make sense to put the same type of conveyance pulled by regular horses on the ground behind an "iron horse" running along a rail? That is indeed what was tried in the early days of American railroads

&nbsp;  

Here's the part that gets the biggest 'so what':

> In other words, there was nothing inevitable about a railroad gauge supposedly traceable to the size of wheel ruts in Imperial Rome. Had the Civil War taken a different course, the eventual standard railroad gauge used throughout North America might well have been different than the current one.

The fact that it wouldn't be the case in an alt-history scenario has nothing to do with anything.  Like, wut.    spoil sport!

The statement that the north may have won the civil war partially based on their engineering standardization makes me a happy engineer. Wow. Word for word... Can't believe someone gave gold to a chain email copypasta. The world we live in. That's the same reason Russia uses broad gauge, although I assume their primary concern was the Germans or Austrians not the French. "Daddy, why are barns red?"  
"Something something stars overdose"
 Most definitely not. After the first sentence I recognized this.  Copypasta gold I definitely saw this somewhere else on Reddit recently. OC?  That spiel has been around since literally before the internet. Weird Starting a sentence with, "Well," as though it were being explained in a narrative style, is the surest sign that the information is not only unoriginal but has potentially been embellished as well. No problem, grandma! Be sure to forward to your friends!  
http://www.snopes.com/history/american/gauge.asp Can confirm, actually owned both those games too haha. GameCube as well, and original DS cases had a spot for GBA games. I've got a bunch of them sitting just 10 feet from me. I love those old things. Don't they already do? Nes manual says hello.  But the last full manual I got in a modern game was shovel Knight  You get better quality than mp3s, a lot of the time it's cheaper to buy the cd than to download the whole album. If you listen to album-based music (like me), cds are the way to go.  The 3DS boxes are also much smaller then the DS boxes where. I'm assuming the switch will have a similar case.

Less room on my shelf for more games win-win. Animal Crossing on the GameCube did, idk if any PS2 games did though. I think they were more intended for storage and travel than for the memory cards to come with the game. I remember Pokemon Colosseum coming with one for the GameCube  the International Plastic Modelers Society I believe the objection is to the height of the case, not the thickness. It's a generic size to fit more than just one disc if necessary. Like a one size fits all kind of deal. It costs more money to have more sizes produced.  When blu-ray was just introduced that was the case yes, however nowadays you don't really see it anymore.  So, does anyone ever pm you? Meow Fuck yeah they will.  PC games and Playstation games used to come in "music cd cases". I think PS2 may have started the "dvd cases" trend. Kind of like ps1 cases! Music CDs?!  What are these magical things you speak of? CD format cases are too thin and weak with terrible hinges. It'd be nice to find a middle ground with the sturdiness of DVD thickness plastic and hinges with a smaller footprint. When CDs were new, they did the same thing: they were packaged in 12 inch by 6 inch boxes so they would fit on record stores' vinyl album racks. Remember that when CD's first came out, they were in these long cardboard boxes that contained the CD case on the upper end.  The reason why they were so tall was because the stores put them in the same bins the (then outgoing, now coming back?) vinyl albums were being sold out of. Well, they could use Blu Ray disks, but CD cases, if they wanted to. The first Final Fantasy Theatrhythm has little pictures of the various characters on the inside.  I don't think Curtain Call does though. I wouldn't call the 2 page flier they put in SM3DL a manual. Kingdom Hearts 3D used the squares as picture frames for some of the types of creatures in the game! Rune Factory 4 has a similar thing. It received a perfect rating from Famitsu and got 90-100 from various reviewers. I'd be curious to see what you think an overrated game is. Overrated game for lefties who can't even play it properly...  Lol, it was widely bought, had great reviews, and was super active for several years. How was it underrated? Maybe, in the sequel, they'll make thos handheld title playable while using the console as an actual handheld. 

I mean, a stand? Seriously?  So then... they're NOT saving any plastic. So it doesn't matter that there are holes, because it's thicker material anyways.   I saw one of those at my local game store the other day. I was amazed at how tiny and cute it was. I wish they had done that with gamecube cases here in the US!
 This is why I wont buy digital anymore. Had someone hack my account and spend nearly $2000. Bank saw fraud and froze the funds and made a chageback on my behalf. Sony banned my account and the only way to get it back is to pay the "balance". Then they will consider disputing it. Thing is my account was only ~400 new so it totally wasnt worth it. 

Much rather have the physical copy where i cant have access revoked at a whim. Plus half the time it's cheaper to buy a physical copy off amazon than it is to buy a digital copy of the game.  They can ban physical games just as easily as digital ones. You still need a license to play them and they can revoke that if they want.  Plus I can resell my games on a amazon when tired of them.  I only recently learned of this. I only buy digital copies, largely because of convenience and storage. This account-locking thing is awful. If you can prove your purchase, they should let you transfer your copy. Or gift it, or even sell it. All they have to do is enable one account and disable it on another account. But if Sony locks my account and I love my 50 games, then I... I guess I'll go outside. On the other hand, I can't lose my entire inventory to a burglar, fire, flood or any other physical threat. Insurance can't replace a physical copy of something that's out of print, only compensate for it financially. I'm entitled to an indefinite number of replacement copies of a digital game on my account so long as I have said account. 

It's swings and roundabouts. When people talk about the risks of digital media, they often forget that physical copies aren't indestructible by contrast - an optical disc [only remains readable for so long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_rot). You're not going to see an antique videogame collection as old as an NES library because optical media simply doesn't keep as long as cartridges, for example.  Yeah, but many if not all of the new games require you to have some kind of online access, so it is kind of irrelevant. I feel like this sort of logic is why my parents still keep a landline phone "in case of emergencies."  Why is that?  I just bought a PS4 for my daughter and I noticed that it's $10 more to download the game than it is to have a physical copy of it.   How in the hell could it be more expensive to allow someone to download it?  > I look at it more as "but muh ability to loan the game to friends."

I've got a friend coming back home from over a year overseas and he has like three games for his PS4. I can't wait to loan him a dozen more when he gets back next month  Steam lets you loan games to friends. As long as you aren't on steam at the same time as your friend, you can play any game in their library. Also, some of us like having a physical collection. There is something weirdly comforting about being able to see your collection. Especially if the collection has personal sentimental or nostalgic value.  But game sharing exists too, just only to one person At Gamestop right now, the trade-in value of Blops 3 is $4.40 Christ bro never sell used games to Gamestop. You get so so little for it, it's just not even worth it. You can typically make more money selling it elsewhere, especially online. Even after a few dollars in shipping fees you'll still make more money than what Gamestop will give you. Fuck them.  I'm so happy the free copy of Witcher 3 with my gtx 970 came on GoG GoG also reminds me of the really cool practices of the TTRPG companies Piazo and Posthuman studios.

Basically, everything is some form of public domain forever, people buy stuff because they love their RPGs and want them to make more, not because the cost is the barrier to getting the product. People have payed good money for digital subscriptions that went away when the company went away. That's happened already. Tons of us still have floppies and carts from the 70s and 80s. With DRM on digital downloads, your ability to access stuff is at the mercy of the company. Technically speaking, you own the physical media.  However, the data on that physical media is protected by copyright which prohibits you from making unauthorized copies.  Due to the way computers work, you cannot actually utilize the software without violating copyright unless you agree to the license agreement.  So you can disagree with the license all you want and still keep the physical media - but you won't be able to (legally) load/copy the software into memory and execute it. But even if you break those licenses they wouldn't know and wouldn't be able to do anything about it in many cases. No one's going to come to your house and take the game out of your hands. Its more tangible and feels more like yours. i dunno but if i give someone my Steam password they can play shit to their hearts content.

I also still can download and play games on Steam that have been discontinued from the store. But you own the physical product, don't you? You may have limited rights for what you can do with the content, but a CD or a DVD can't be revoked arbitrarily. A streaming license or DRM download can be. Multiplayer access keys died off a few years ago. Even EA gave up on them. But they can't come to your house and take the game out of your hands if you break that license. But how will he play his early 21st century games in a hundred years when there is no more PSN? https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/57g82l/psa_origin_may_remove_games_from_your_account/ Losing my Steam account would be a huge loss. [deleted] You're most certainly not from Burundi or Kyrgyzstan Just for those wondering. Myanmar seems to have been banned from digital platform. Right but even "dvd" sized cases have made strides as far as how much plastic they use. I swear they removed about 40% of the plastic from the flat faces and made them as thin as paper. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't use about the same amount of plastic as the thick bluray cases. [This](http://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/images/g/3FcAAOSw5ZBWPNbJ/s-l225.jpg) is what i'm talking about. That's ridiculous. All of the downsides of digital distribution, at the inconvenience of physical media. Thats fucked, the only reason I would ever buy pysical copies is to save download time or bandwith. Jokes on them. You got the digital copy at sale price. Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I don't think they know what "physical copy" means. There was an interesting article I read once on I think NPR which was about one of the engineers who had pleaded to get them to cancel or delay the launch due to some of these factors and was ignored.

He lived with the burden of guilt for almost his entire life until they did the piece on him and some of his former higher-ups heard and went out of their way to contact him to tell him that he had done everything right and they should have listened to him. Only finally near the end of his life did he experience relief or catharsis that he was not the cause of the deaths.

Can't imagine living for decades with that sort of guilt that is entirely not your fault just because your boss wouldn't listen to you.... Yes, but the real and final reason for the Challenger explosion was a seal that was completely ineffective in cold temperatures and was known to occasionally fail. See all that stuff slouching off the main rocket at launch? That's Ice. It was the failure of a seal that led to the explosion, which further illustrated the engineering flaws. Without that seal failure, the flaws would've continued to go unnoticed and something else would've led to disaster. 

Having worked as a government contractor, the level of oversight and what's gotten away with is pretty significant and often only addressed when the flaws become critical.  Meagan Trainor was right A scholar's commentary on that verse:
>because they had chariots of iron; but this was no reason why they could not drive them out, if God was with them, who could as easily have delivered these into their hands, as the inhabitants of the mountains; but is the reason why **they were afraid to fight with them..**

If you wanna get all biblical and such, this is the actual meaning of that verse. Not God's lack of ability, but His people's fear and lack of faith. [Many scholars agree](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/judges/1-19.htm) Yeah, normally snopes is pretty spot on but it seemed like the editor just wanted to throw false on there just out of spite of the pastas writing style. 

Basically their argument is "well, most things are gonna be close to that size for practicalities sake..." no shit, snopes?  I read the article the same way. They seemed to agree, point for point. Oh but all clothing is made to the same specification? How is that even an argument? The website must be run by politifact.  No, it's a good point.  The speculation is all about how it was somehow "derived from the roman chariot" which isn't really the case at all.  It's true that the roman chariot and many other wheeled conveyances were often of vaguely similar width, and thus so too are roads, but there's no direct link from any specific vehicle to the exact measurement of the railroads.

That's the point of the confederacy example—even though the confederacy used a *different* standard, you could make the *same* argument about it being "directly traceable to the size of wheel ruts in imperial Rome."   That rather takes the wind out of the proposition.

The idea is "Well, yeah, roads around the world and railroads too are all in the same ballpark width-wise for a variety of physical reasons" is a very different claim than "The precise number of inches between railroad rails is directly traceable to ancient Rome!"  The former is true, but not particularly remarkable, while the later is remarkable, but untrue. It says it proves it false, but I feel like I missed the part where they proved anything except that the civil war was a necessary event in order to make that our standard. It seems like it's still traceable back to the Roman chariots, wheel ruts, then a common growth of locomotive technology between the US and England, then the Union winning the war became proof that a standard gauge was superior.  No, no, "And the ruts in the roads?" was changed to "And the rut they the roads?" Totally different! Barns are red with the blood of Amy Winehouse.  Why they would list it as false is beyond me since they admit that US standard railroad gauge came from england which got its width from charriots which got its width from romans which was determined by horses ass.  
The only part that is false is that it caused the Challenger to explode and op didn't include that part. oh :( god damn it

also that article needs a SERIOUS tl;dr GameCube with their little Debby donut-sized discs still used the normal case size. That's just bananas I just had to clear room on my 4mb memory card :( Yes. They give no manual. why don't you just download a .wav or lossless file then? European DS cases were twice as big as 3DS cases (which are the same size in both the US and Europe). In the US, though, DS cases were always the same size as 3DS cases. 

I don't know about other regions, though... I went to a high school with the acronym PHS and had the middle school across the street from us with the acronym PMS, so parents started complaining about it and came up with the solution to name it PIS for "p. Intermediate school"

So they went from pmsing to pissing They never object to the thickness Nice try, officer. From a fellow member of the PM Club, it happens!

...sometimes.

...kind of.  Wouldn't you like to know ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) If you put a butter up piece of toast on a cats back and throw it out of a two story window you're an asshole. PC games used to be in CD cases that were in [huge cardboard boxes.](http://mmc.bolha.com/0/image/193503/193887/Worms-2---Big-Box--orig--kart--skatla--legenda_55a8e466c3402.jpg) Those were the times. Going back even farther, I know the Sega CD had both large cases and small cases. The large ones were bigger than the cartridge cases, which made it a pain to line them all up on a shelf.  They did this because you could remove the game by popping the hinges and retaining the seal of the game put a different game in and return. I always thought the ps1 used a cd case because the disk was based on cd technology (~700MB) the ps2s used DVD style cases because the games were on DVD's and then ps3 and ps4 use the slightly smaller Blu-ray style cases because of the discs being Blu-rays. PlayStation games originally came on big boxes that were the size of Sega CD cases, roughly. Same with Saturn games.

That said, this was only in the US. Japan always had CD case sized cases for their games. I wish they had taken that route in the US as well. > PC games

Remember when PC games used to come in these huge boxes and all they had was a CD and a booklet haha. If anyone recalls, the very first PS1 games [came in large DVD case sized cardboard boxes.](http://videogamecritic.com/images/systems/psboxth.jpg) I had X-Com, and I think Loaded, that were both in the original cases. [deleted] You know, the small laser discs Like DS/3DS game cases? It'd be entirely possible to make cases exactly like the current DVD ones, in the size dimensions of a music CD. You mean exactly like in the OP image?  CD jewel cases fucking suck and I hope I never have to use one again for the rest of my life. Yeah it got progressively less and less.

Some games still had a manual or at least a foldout with the controls.

These days you can be happy if there is piece of paper with the game's Logo on it.  I guess a better term would be "overlooked" instead of "underrated". Well for example, I hardly see people talk about Uprising anymore. That's what I mean by underrated. Compare it to Fire Emblem Awakening which was released around the same time and also got high reviews. People still talk about that game. It rebirthed the Fire Emblem fanbase. I'm not saying Awakening is overrated, I'm just saying that the attention towards Uprising seems to have died a long time ago.  They're not thicker, just the edges are better constructed. I've never understood that line of thinking from Sony. It's happened to so many people too, where they get hacked and someone runs up huge charges, then when they try and show Sony (with proof, mind you) that the charges were from a hack they're like "no yeah we believe you, but you still have to pay the balance before we'll think about disputing it. So fuck off." 

That's why I don't have my credit card info anywhere near Sony's service anymore on my PS4. I just buy the 3-month PS-Plus cards from Amazon and put the code in and go, and any time I feel like buying digital I do the same thing. It's helped a lot. Your first mistake was trusting Sony with your money.  You can still get your access revoked on a whim, even if you own a physical copy. Software activation is a thing. Reporting an account breach should clear this up. With GOG you can actually download your game as offline copy. Which works when you save that copy on offline storage as backup. Including dlc and such. Retailers will put physical copies on sale to reduce inventory when a games sales start to slow. Digital inventory never needs to be reduced so there is one less reason to reduce the price or have sales. Amazon is the way to go for games that are year or more old.  

Edit: spelling And if you have Amazon Prime you get new releases cheaper too, $48 vs $60 (approximately).  This right here. I've told my friends so many times that the physical copies are way cheaper if ordered at the right time but no, they need their digital copies. Meanwhile, if both of us buy 3 games a year, I'm essentially getting the third game for free with the money I saved. YMMV - but I've never had a production CD or DVD just stop working, talking early 80's compact discs, to anything.  I had a PSX game that started clouding up because of the dye in the plastic but it still reads just fine.  You can also back that shit up. 

Physical gives you more control - more control is better - always.  Physical holds a value after you're done with it - digital doesn't - Your account gets hacked and frozen, all your "digital assets" are in limbo.  If you get hacked on Sony you're fucked - they don't give a shit about your account.  >I'm entitled to an indefinite number of replacement copies of a digital game on my account so long as I have said account.

Except for those few games where you can only install X number of times or on Y different computers before it prevents you from installing it anymore. Luckily those are very rare, but they exist. I hope such tactics go away for good. Stores need to turn over inventory so they put the physical copies on sale.  Because the XBox and PS4 marketplaces are locked gardens. There are half a dozen major players in the PC digital marketplace, but the console ones are total monopolies. Thus they have Zero reason to be competitive with pricing. They also have no reason to compete with brick and mortar, because by the time the games are on the shelf, the console maker has already been paid.

Also, the point others made about brick and mortar stores needing to keep stock moving, rather than sitting on stacks of older games is a valid point. basically because of stock, digital cost nothing to keep stock of, if gamestop and walmart have 50 copies of black ops 3 sitting in the stock room they are going to sell it cheaper to get rid of it.

and probably because you can gameshare which cuts the cost of digital games in half. Stores said if digital is priced lower they will no longer sale anything related to that console. Since companies need to sell consoles, controllers, and other accessories. They caved in and agreed. Next gaming cycle though I could see the PlayStation forgo this mentality and sell digital cheaper.  Hey, it's me, your friend. I don't use steam very often but please, tell me how this is done? A friend of mine has DS3 I want to play and he wants to mess around in Terraria/Stardew valley.  Well technically if you, the main user, switched to offline mode and your friend logged into your account you both could play the same game. I did that with Fallout4 when it first came out. Until the children arrive... 5 kids later and I'm on the digital only train.  Nothing weird about it. If you piss off Steam or Sony, they can revoke your license to the game.

Go dispute a charge on Steam/Sony or call a customer support member a cunt and see if they have any means to stop you from playing a game you physically own. this is how I buy all my games, me and my buddy game share, I'll buy 1 brand new game, then he buys the next, basically giving us brand new games at 50% off Damn That's not enough to even eat at Taco Bell  This is why I went all digital. When I want to trade my games in like a year later, even a month or two later, they give you no money in return. I understand they have a business to run, but I'd rather just keep my games.  You know why stores like that give so little? Because everyone and their dog is trading in the same games. Black Ops 3 is worth $4 because they'll get five more people trying to trade it in that day. They don't need it. They can make their console require an Internet connection and can block you from using their game. Digital rights management can work with physical media if there's something built into the device/object or a connection required. You probably mean tangible rather than finite. This from the Playstation 4 EULA: 
>SCE reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice to you, to change the terms of this Agreement. The most current version of this Agreement will supersede all previous versions.

And I'm pretty sure you agree to something similar upon buying the game.. Yeah EULAs are crap.. But someone else can. Or you can damage the disk. Or have a flood. Or spill Mt. Dew on it. Etc.  All you're really saying there is that it's harder for them to *enforce* their claims—the actual facts of ownership are the same.  In that case, if you're violating the ToS anyway, why not just pirate it in such a situation? Nintendo will if you're playing Pokémon really early. I've had the same steam account for 11 years, I don't understand how people lose their accounts all the time unless they're hacking How does it actually get permanently lost? Password + Steam Guard and you're pretty much unlikely to ever lose it. You'd have to lose your Email and phone AND someone would need your Steam password. If you've lost all this, you probably have bigger problems than your Steam library. My main issue is storage space. Let's say I want to download a new game onto my Xbox One. I'm gonna have to delete one of the six games currently saved onto my hard drive. So everything is cool as long as I only like playing 6 different video games. Of course, if I wanna play one I deleted I could just delete another one and wait 30 hours for the old one to re-download. Or I could spend a bunch of money on an external hard drive. 

Just give me more storage, damn it.  And *you're* clearly not from Des Moines. Obviously, you are not playing golf. On PC I'd be hard pressed to name any downsides I give a shit about. There's resale of course, but I never did that even when I used physical media for games. Other than that... I don't know. Digital is faster, easier, usually cheaper, more environmentally friendly. It even makes it easier for me to share my games with friends (Steam friends and family support is pretty damned good).

For consoles I don't know since I've never dealt with their digital distribution. It's a lot easier to accept the blame decades removed from the disaster and ensuing PR nightmare. It gets posted on /r/TIL pretty regularly. In fact now that you've mentioned it, we'll see it on the front page tomorrow. The real and final reason was an ethics failure at Morton Thiokol. They knew that the seals would fail. 

Roger Boisjoly was the name of the engineer that performed the initial investigation something like a year earlier and given the low temperatures forecasted he advised cancelling the launch. Initially Morton Thiokol advised NASA of that finding on their pre-launch conference.

Then management at Morton Thiokol decided to change their story that the data was actually inconclusive and based off that NASA went ahead with the disastrous launch. 

Was a mandatory study case in our engineering ethics course, that and the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. 

 Reads like a nitpicky neckbeard who starts his conversations with "Well actually...". The entire article was a pedantic rant aimed at some kind of Devil's Advocate approach but then slowly started forgetting his main punchline and eventually just completely agreed and confirmed the entire thing with even more proof and historical events that lead directly back to the Romans. BUT, the "FALSE" radio button was already selected and he didn't want to get the Doritos dust he accumulated during the writing of the article to get on his brand new gaming mouse so he tabbed to "Submit Article" and hit enter on his crusty keyboard.  It's a terrible argument. Clothing is made to fit *people* who happen to come in a set of less than arbitrary sizes and have certain utilitarian and aesthetic desires. There's no specific reason why tracks couldn't be 30% wider or smaller. "Direct" was the key word. Yeah, my reading of the Snopes piece is that you can directly trace the 4 foot, 8.5 inch gauge directly back to the Romans. There were many other competing sizes, but the 4 foot, 8.5 inch gauge won out, and it seems a lot of that had to do with the fact that it was the historical legacy size. That's the bit that really confuses me. So it wasn't a copy/paste? No one would type up all of this from a source, right? But then why mangle a sentence? WHAT DOES IT MEAN? They tried to make me paint the barn red. 

So I just chugged, chugged, chugged.

They used to have manuals, sometimes area maps or a poster too. Saturn retained that case design too I believe.  Dreamcast went to cd jewel cases Also you remember the 32x CD cases?  I'm giving that one a thumbs up for shittiest case.  It was all cardboard with nothing in it to actually hold the disks so they just rattled around, and it was still vhs size so there was plenty of empty space. If I remember correctly, they were all big box games. Some were the tall jewel case versions and others did come in the cd jewel case but were inside a tall outer cardboard box. I dont remember any selling as just small cd cases though?
On a side note I wish I didnt sell all my Sega CD games as a kid for pennies on a dollar... got ripped off by one of those mail order companies in the back of a games magazine. All the large cases were ridiculously fragile, as well. Most games for it (and the US Saturn, fuck you Bernie Stolar) are sold secondhand as bare discs because of this. [deleted] Don't think that's the reason. More likely used DVD cases so you can sort your memory card in the case
*Spelling I've never seen a more perfect description.

Blu-Rays are a bit smaller already They dont need to be that awful hard plastic though. Jewel Case Size with modern materials would be ideal. What. How dare you..  I bought pokemon moon last night, opened the case expecting some neat little slip with either a promotional event or *something* and I got an ad for a toy by Tomy :T So overlooked then? Hidden gem even I have an Xbox, but that's a good idea. I'll have to do that in the future. Especially since Sony haven't historically been the best at protecting their customer data  Because Sony doesn't give a fuck about its customers. In fact I'd say they aren't even indifferent, they're actively hostile to their customers. 

Remember when Sony secretly installed root kits on their customers computers? I do. I've been boycotting them ever since. I will never buy a Sony product. They are an abhorrent company that hates its customers.  Coming from a company like Sony who was hacked themselves,  you'd think they would have some understanding.  Yup thats my lesson learned from all of this. I dont trust them with my credit card anymore. Why can't Sony just remove the games licenses in question? I don't get it... Yeah, bit then you'd still be able to resell the game One of the few advantages of console gaming.  They can revoke my account all they want, they can't stop me from playing my games offline.  My discs are mine.   *Should*. In much the same way as EA *should* not revoke access to games people have paid for over Origin because of the country they live in. Actually pick any new release and give it 2-4 weeks, you'll find it cheaper than digital in brick and mortar.  You reduce the price of digital (in a sale) to have people buy it who otherwise wouldn't. Since there is almost zero incremental cost, it's almost a no-brainer. Source: The large number of unplayed games in my Steam library. If you're going to put some random caveat on your point, you have to acknowledge that if I wait for the right time digitally, I can hit up a steam sale and purchase more games for 20 dollars than you could physically for 60. > but I've never had a production CD or DVD just stop working

The same way I've never had an account get hacked. On top of that, DRM-free games aren't tied to any account. So who's hurting more? The digital vendor missing out on sales or the physical vendor giving discounts? 🤔 > They also have no reason to compete with brick and mortar, because by the time the games are on the shelf, the console maker has already been paid.

Worth pointing out, this is half true.

If they could sell to brick & mortar, but still sell you the game and have every copy collect dust on the store shelves, they totally would. More money for them.

They wouldn't dare do that though, alienating physical sales would be a horrible plan. Log into Steam on their machine, pull down the 'Steam' menu and select 'Settings'.  On the left menu, click 'Family'.  In the section 'Family Library Sharing', check the box labeled 'Authorize Library Sharing on this computer'.  Log out of Steam.

Once you have done this, your games should show up in their library.  They'll need to do the same on your machine to share their library with you.

edit: You can only use their library if they are not and vice versa.  If you are playing a game of theirs and they start playing a game of theirs, Steam will notify you and give you five minutes to save and quit before kicking you out.  I'm not sure if it's still like this, but my favorite feature is that if a friend is using your library, you can use theirs at the same time.  You just can't both be using the same library at the same time. Google "steam friends and family" Five kids and you have time for video games? 

Teach me. I only have one and haven't touched my Xbox in weeks  Yep have one kid and I made the switch after he wrecked a bunch of older ps3 games. Can you each play at the same time? I know you can't do that with lending a physical disk obviously, I'm just wondering about the feasibility of this in terms of buying new game when they release and being able to play them for cheap What kind of fancy Taco Bell do you eat at? I couldn't overpraise the convenience too. I know people complain about not having the hard drive space but you don't need everything downloaded at the same time. But now when I go home for the weekend or something, I can just take my PS4 home and not worry about anything else 8 years here. My account was hacked when I stopped gaming for a while. I spent 5 minutes back and forth with customer service to get it back. Not a big deal.  http://a.co/eB9FHUa

$109 5TB. Had mine for over a year, still haven't filled it up. And I buy a lot of games you can put a bigger hard drive in both the xbox one and the PS4... not sure about the Xbox, but the PS4 is like 3 screws and you're done. At least Xbox One lets you use external storage, so you can add storage by USB. 
I have a PS4 and the first thing I did was install a 1TB SATA Solid State Hybrid Drive. I don't even buy many games from the PSN store, but between all the free-to-play games (Star Trek Online, War Thunder etc.) and the games from Playstation Plus, I'm running low and need to delete stuff to make room for new stuff. 
And installing a new, larger, hard drive would be far more painful than the ability to plug in an external drive.  Yeah but if Sony stopped letting you download it 20 years from now it would be pretty shitty. You could want to play that classic again. Not a big deal but still. Or if it was suddenly banned in your country. Gone. 

Whereas i can take out my ps1 right now and spend a few hours on res4 or something. I'd imagine it would suck if you couldnt do that years from now with current consoles. Download size of 115 GB. Good luck with your bandwidth. How magnanimous of those executives and directors to belay that man's guilt ~~4~~ 3 decades after the fact.   It's the American way.

In fact, the original claim outlines a daisy-chain of historical practices which is anything but direct. There's a dick joke in there somewhere.

Unless you like kids.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Member' Prima Game guides? Weirdly enough some early PS1 games used those boxes, too. I always wondered if Sony got somesurplus Sega packaging or something. The shittiest part was that they expected anyone to own both a 32X and Sega CD. [deleted] Which is funny because unless you're playing something like Animal Crossing, which takes up an entire 4MB memory card on the Gamecube if I remember right, you're probably only going to have a couple memory cards with all of your save data. Your Gran Turismo memory card probably also has save data for five other games on it. Thus, it's a bit pointless to have a memory card holder in every single game case. I know I never used those holders. Weena!!!!!! If this gets out, it could destroy the /r/youtubehaiku meta for WEEKS They shattered if you sneezed in the same room as them. Here in europe we got an ad for eshop games

on there was also the demo for Sun & Moon

But the selection of eshop games was nice. I usually buy a 1-year one around Black Friday. I didn't get one this year, but I can usually find it for around half off. Last year I got 1 year for $20.  They've been one of the worst. There's 12 year olds just starting to learn programming who would think to not store sensitive information in plain text. For what, $3? The consumer is hurting more. Definitely the physical store. Their inventory includes the cost of maintaining their physical store, as well as the materials used in the game and the middle man costs too. 

If anything, itd make sense for digital games to be MUCH cheaper than physical copies because they cut a lot of that cost out of the process, but they get away with same or slightly higher prices because that's what we're willing to pay for it and it's what we are used to from pre-digital game prices.

EDIT: Not to mention the trend seems to favor digital, see the death of video stores, such as Blockbuster in favor of Redbox, which then is slowly dying away because of Netflix.  I'd say the store vendor. If they're having no problem selling games at $59 then they're just as happy as the other digital vendor. But remember the store has to spend money to make money by having the games on the shelves for customers to buy. The digital vendors don't have to buy up cloud space for each game code sold so they don't have to pay EA and the like to build up their inventory.  Well usually either the digital vendor is the company who makes the game console (eg the Nintendo eShop) or Steam. In the former case the company gets paid whether you buy it digitally or not, and in the latter case Steam is clearly doing just fine; people will pay more to get it from Steam because of the convinience.  This is awesome.  How am I just learning about this today? So even if they're playing a different game in the same library, it kicks them out?  Like, if I'm playing Civilization VI and I want to share Saints Row IV because it's in my library, you can't play my SR4 if I'm playing Civ VI?

If I'm understanding that right, this is still inferior to just being able to hand your friend a game and you'll get it back when they're done, or giving them an old game you never play anymore.

It's still better than not being able to share at all, I guess, but not by a lot. Sedatives? Well once you get to five, assuming there's some time in between, you should be able to get the oldest one to take care of the younger ones for a bit. Take the time you spend browsing reddit, and use it to play video games. I never believe someone when they say they have "no free time".  Your SO is holding you back more than likely or she views video games as a waste of time. It basically boils down to efficiency.

You are in this loop of when baby is awake mom feeds it and hands it off to you while she cleans/cooks to play. Baby then goes down for a nap and SO wants to chill and relax by watching TV. She also wants to spend time with you. So you both get hooked on seasoned TV shows that you watch while baby is napping. 

If you try and play games while she is relaxing and baby is napping, you aren't spending enough time with her. If you try to play games while she is cooking/cleaning, you aren't spending time with baby.

During this shit show on weekdays, weekends are filled up with your wife making plans with friends and family to come over for visits or so you hit all the social events to make sure there is no reasons for friends to dislike her. Sundays are household maintenance and restock days. 

Heres how you break the cycle.

Your wife is going to be exhausted in the early evening and with the broken sleep she gets on the regular. Have her pump boob milk or formula and offer to take the first couple wake ups after your put baby down (usually 7-8PM) and encourage her to sleep (usually at 9-10PM). That is your time to game my friend (10PM - 1AM).

If you can't run on less than 7 hours sleep for work the next day, you are a fucking amateur and not a true gamer.

Try anything digital when the fastest internet provided within 3 miles of you is 1.5mbps. 20 years from now I could probably just emulate it. People say that, but it's exceedingly rare for people to still have a console 20 years later that's still actually functioning. Stored does not mean well maintained. I'd put money on the majority of my downloaded games being more easily available than my physical games after a similar amount of time. In fact, I've paid to get digital versions of DOS games for DOSBox that I no longer have any way of playing despite owning the originals as physical copies. Oh and the floppies are dead - completely unreadable. The same thing happens with CDs, DVDs, and BluRays. Physical storage is not forever. Uh it was only 3 decades. Don't scare me and make me think I might be 40 instead of only 30! Nice try. You can't cross out a 4. Or a capital H. Basically there was a two tier walkway with one on the 2nd floor and one on the 4th. 

The original plans called for a threaded rod that ran all the way down through the ceiling and each walkway to be attached to the hanging rods with a nuts underneath the flooring on a steel channel. 

Then someone at the steel manufacturer decided that it should be two rods because of the difficulty in manufacturing and installing that long a threaded rod. What's the difference right? 

Well, if you've taken Freshman Statics the difference is between the nuts on the 4th floor walkway supporting only the 4th floor walkway and with the redesign supporting both the weight of the 2nd and 4th floor walkways. 

That was beyond the strength of the assembly and when loaded with people during a party the 4th floor collapsed onto the 2nd floor walkway killing over 100 people and seriously injuring another 200+. 

The PE who stamped the original plans didn't recalculate the loads on the proposed modification to go to 2 rods and just stamped it. A freshman ME could have caught the issue but they didn't bother.

 I'll take your word for it.  They're all cats I've had nothing.  I've gotten a few real pics and one troll pic. I consider that a success Prove it! I'm not interested of course. I just like honest men.  I didn't see any exclusion of man tits there, that literally doubles his pool! Translation: Once... I think?  I remember when they were called strategy guides. Well, what if they didn't have one in every box and I just happened to buy games that didn't have them. Then I wouldn't have an easy way to carry my memory card if I wanted to carry it with me. I used them a lot when I would bring my ps2 games over to friends and we wanted to use my save.  I remember some games taking up quite a lot of space. I believe GTA and MGS were pretty big files Oh yeah....  You can find them all the time for $35. Rarely I've seen $30. Don't think I've seen $20 though, that's pretty crazy. I have an easy solution, no need to store passwords. Just check if text was entered in the password field and if that's the case assume it's correct. See? Data is secured because none is kept. Brb, sending CV to Sony. Wait, you mean to tell me *superimportantpasswords.txt* is not a secure system of data storage?  Bruh... Listen, as a consumer, Imma do what's best for me. They can duke it out for all I care. I'm buying what's cheapest.  Exactly. It's consumer vs consumer. If a bunch of people are willing to pay 60 bucks for a digital game then they fuck the rest of us. I do notice there are more sales with digital games now so there is a bright side.  But for the most part, i want physical so i can sell the games when ps5 comes out. Eventually everything will be available on emulators for free anyway.  I actually pay less for steam games than I do for console games.
Especially if I purchase those games from Green Man Gaming, but aside from counting sales, most steam games go for about 10$ less than physical copies of games at the store, or console games. I believe you can dodge the "not using the same library at the same time" by either turning off your networking or blocking steam from accessing the network, after you have launched the game. Honestly, Valve hasn't been great about explaining features of Steam. So unless I make more I'm screwed? Don't tell the Mrs.. I browse reddit at work, I cannot whip out a console and play while I do a spreadsheet For the record the Xbox One has the same "feature" using the Home Xbox feature. ... Happy Humpday!
 Oh we eat at the same one The bigger one in my eyes is what if steam goes out of business. No more steam servers to authenticate your games. What happens to the possibly thousands of dollars in your collection. My collection is almost exclusively with steam but it is something I worry about. Same I was a toddler when we watched the challenger explode over our house...only 32.  To be fair, there are many issues that freshman MEs could catch if they knew what to look for.  Hindsight is 20/20 and when there is a failure it is easy to scrutinize that one aspect and figure out why it failed and what could have been done differently.  The sad reality is that there often isn't time to check every single aspect of a project.  Had it been something like a sinkhole that ruined the building there would have been a review committee asking why a sinkhole study wasn't performed.  If the engineer said it was, they would have asked why a more extensive test wasn't done which would have caught it.  

I have worked in a few different industries and I have designed parts which went though years of design and development and years more of testing as well as extremely expensive US tooling to ensure acceptable tolerances.  Then on the other end, I have designed parts in a couple weeks with only a couple weeks more of testing make by much cheaper tools in China.  More time or money could make it a better product, but those are not in the project budget.  I voice my concerns with the design and explain where and how extra time and money can be used, but deadlines trump that.  If I held the same quality/reliability/safety standards as the other job, I would be fired because they would assign me work with a deadline and I would simply have to refuse to hit that deadline, and plenty of other people would be willing to.

Cars for example were far less safe just 10 years ago, but all the engineers didn't refuse to design cars because someone could die in a wreck which could be avoided if they waited a decade or two for stronger steels, more precise simulation software, or wait even longer still until self driving cars are proven out.  

At a certain point there is an obligation to stop things if the danger is significant enough, but that is easier when there is a clear known defect that needs to change than it is to say you are going to delay the building construction for a few months so you can double check all the details.  I doubt this one rod was the only thing in the building that changed.  So while it might only take a couple hours to analyze the split theaded rod issue. It may have been hidden in a list of thousands of things the suppliers changed from the blueprints, along with thousands of others that weren't documented. > One victim's right leg was trapped under an I-beam and had to be amputated by a surgeon, a task which was completed with a chainsaw.

Damn. Username checks out  154 Hopper Avenue
Fair Lawn, NJ 610452 My SSN is 6 and my address is 420 Nunyabusiness Lane, Fugoff, OK, United States of America, Earth yep. Asa Akira is considered a "milf"...and she's 30 years old. I guess she can be a milf, if you're 15....

actually, this all makes sense now... You forgot the crucial co-ed stage, afterwards they become a MILF.   That wouldn't work. They go milf at 25 Thats why you watch amateur/homemade. More realistic towards age. We're all cats on this blessed day! Are you suggesting that 50% of redditors are ladies? I find that hard to believe. Every redditor I've ever talked to has been male.  Half...most likely How appropriate. You fight like a cow! Why even bother with a password field.  Just enter your username, and make people tick a box saying "I solemnly swear that I am the person connected to this username".  I mean, it's not like people would go and lie on the internet. Either way you're screwed. ;) Well, not with that attitude. Over your house holy shit "It was later revealed that when Havens called Jack D. Gillum and Associates to propose the new design, the engineer they spoke with simply approved the changes over the phone, without viewing any sketches or performing calculations."

This was just gross negligence man. Part of the problem is that we humans tend to have a "It's just a quick fix" mentality where small changes are assumed to not need much examination or testing. As a software engineer, this has bitten me a few times (less so as I gained experience and learned to reduce the risks). Fortunately, not to the tune of 100 deaths though. Username checks out I used to live with a prostitute in Fair Lawn. No they go MILF as soon as they shoot the "accidental creampie" scene STUPID comment from any world view point. How do you know that every redditor you've talked to is male? 🤔 Or use the PS4 camera to validate that you indeed have an honest face for better security. yeah, but who have you ever seen that hasn't clicked that checkbox? It's just a bad UX to have to do that if everyone already does it. Just remove it and let them SELECT a username from a dropdown so they don't have to type it in. Yeah we lived in cocoa Beach and you could watch the launches from the doorstep. I don't have much memory of them but my brother does remember the Challenger. Oh wow, yeah.  That was bad.  I stand corrected.  I think Sony basically said the opposite or am I wrong?  Devs aren't the issue, it's the Sony heads at this point. Sony also said they were open to mods for Fallout 4 and Skyrim SE, then they crippled them to be almost useless. Sony has backed off on this as the Rocket League developers have said. Xbox and PC is working for a few games (Rocket League. Forza Horizon 3) that I know of. Sony isn't allowing it yet for whatever reason. I know it wasn't official but Dreamcast had cross platform play. On the private servers Dreamcast PSO players can still play with PC players. 

Edit - For those that don't want to read the child comments. Quake 3 officially supported cross platform play and had keyboard and mouse support. This would open so many doors for me as all my friends have ps4 and I have xbox one more importantly wheres skate 4 at I seem to remember Sony, as usual, saying no Sony is stopping it.  Multiple devs have confirmed it. First rule of business; don't let your product get commoditized.

This is a step in that direction, and they will fight it with everything they have.

The only exception is that Microsoft, being a large company with interests in other industries, might agree to allow its product to be commoditized in order to gain share in more lucrative areas. But let's not kid ourselves, that's still for exactly one reason.

 MAKE GAMING GREAT AGAIN. 

 PC is open to this idea as well, especially with your FPS games... Unfortunately, it makes no economical sense for Sony to do this. They are ahead by a good amount in this "console generation" and it would only stand to benefit xbox as the now cheaper option. Its shitty but playstation has no reason to do it
 99% of this thread would be terrible business owners. 

*I should help my competitions customers because it would make them feel good!* Annual PlayStation vs Xbox championship  As a software engineer who otherwise knows nothing about console multi-player gaming setups (servers, infrastructure, protocols, etc), I want to know how either Sony or Microsoft are actually stopping developers from just implementing cross-platform play. What's to stop a company with a game on both platforms from just sending out an update to point MP connections on both consoles at the same server which has been setup to support both consoles?

Does Sony insist that all the MP server software has to run on machines they control or something? Or is it purely a legal matter where the companies have to abide by a bullshit contract that forbids cross-platform support?

If there's no technical reason, I think somebody should just do it. The thing i like about Microsoft right now (Xbox side of it) is their acknowledgement and appreciation of the fans. They're evolving and, for the most part, giving gamers (and to an extent, devs) what they want: Last minute cancellation of always-online, ditching the kinect, decent console prices and bundles, cross-platform, accessible mod support. Its very clever of them because they know its something Sony ISNT doing. And they are benefitted hugely, even if it might've cost them a lot of money early on. I don't see a single reason that gamers wouldn't want this, there's no reason to discuss it. It's on the console companies, not us. As a PC gamer, I'd also love this opportunity to mix with the Console crowd :) Anyone remember the game Shadowrun?  It's all up to Sony. Microsoft has said they want cross platform.

Rocket league has already said they just need to flip the switch. Xbox gave the go ahead, but Sony has not. Is there a good ELI5 over the real issues here?  I thinkThe only thing stopping Sony is the fact that they'd be losing an advantage over Microsoft. If you can play with your friends regardless of console, then you no longer have to buy the more popular one (in this case ps4). That would mean the snow ball effect of one guy buying ps4 and his undecided friend buys it because he did, and then his friends buy it because they want to play with him and so on and so forth disappears and Sony loses that advantage. If they do start cross console play, I'm kind of excited for what the next console war will be like. Why don't we add PC into the mix and make it a three way. There is already a game that has the basic framework of this cross platform idea, called Defiance

The original intent WAS to have cross-platform play, but the idea was scrapped and the game exists on each (xbox, playstation, PC) separately

the game is still alive and actually really addictive... as an MMO shooter, it has all the potential to be an amazingly popular game... 

Unfortunately the developers sidetracked *themselves* with a shitty game called Atlas Reactor that they wasted a ton of resources on. Project Scorpio here I come. So weird last gen it was Xbox 360 screwing players with the PS3 being awesome (hemce why i bought a PS4). Now its completly swapped with the PS4 being the bigger tight arse. The idea that players no matter their platform could play together is a beautiful one. Sadly, this isn't up to us developers; it's up to Sony and Microsoft to ensure we have the right developer setting if we were to try and make this a reality without feeling like we have to abandon something else in the process like our sanity, other features etc. :) I'm still waiting on Sony and Microsoft to launch mouse and keyboard support. They really need it with cross platform to PC, and it also benefits games on a competitive front. 

Edit: If they're already doing PC to Console cross-platform play then enabling players the opportunity to use a mouse and keyboard makes perfect sense. It also gives us more options instead of playing games with an inferior gamepad.  Microsoft already does with their latest games such as Forza Horizon 3, and Gears Of War. [I am totally up with owning you from my PC. ](http://www.gamesradar.com/pc-gamers-destroyed-console-gamers-in-tests-says-voodoo-pc-founder/) This would be trivial to implement. Nothing would be ported, all the compatibility would be server side. The trickiest part would be integrating friends and stuff like that. The new Friday the 13th game is rumored to have this. Should be fun.  As great as it would be for gamers, it'll never happen purely because Sony don't need it and have consistently shown to not bother their arse unless they're struggling. The only reason Microsoft are open to is is because they're not at the top, if the situation was reversed they'd probably be the same.  This is why I do not like consoles. The consumer and the devs have to answer to a corporation. The gaming industry is just theirs to stagnate so they can keep their monopolies and fill their wallets. Their isnt a CEO of PC that even has the ability to deny devs and the consumers the right to develop how they want what they want. don't forget about PC woo And PC!
 Id only ever play a console for a really excellent exclusive title. So Ive held off on buying a ps4 until I see Crash Bandicoot release. So for cross platform, I'm happy with the microsoft win10/xbox one deal they have going. Forza is smooth and functional. With the addition of controller support on pc titles it really is ANY game you can play on console, you can play at higher settings and to a higher degree of skill on a PC. Everything should just release on this format as well as their respective consoles Except Nintendo. Nintendo needs to keep doing its own thing because its adorable and still fun gaming. Super company multiple controllers we're on board  So funny, because I had been preaching this "feature"  since consoles could access the internet.  It güd All i want is to play 2k with my dumb friends that bought an xbox.  It's all up to Sony. Microsoft already said they've got everything in place for it, plus they already do it with PC and Rocket League. It's Sony not cooperating. please sony and microsoft make love and make that crossplatform gaming happen!
 I am all for cross CONSOLE play but once you add PC, you have a much easier time running into hackers, nearly ANY AAA game is hacked a few days BEFORE it is even out. Aimjunkies.com

artificialaiming etc, trust me you bring PC in on consoles, and you will bring the end of console gaming. Does anybody wonder if, considering they're mostly competing with themselves (and maybe a little Nintendo), they're worried 1 console will mostly win online mult player games and significantly shift sales, and don't want to take that risk?  Strength in unity, unity in strength!  [deleted] Yes. Let's end the stupid console wars. A common thread I see is people saying PS4 is outselling Xone and that's why Sony won't do it, but do they really think making cross platform is gonna close the sales gap? I'm pretty sure the gap is the size of the grand canyon... And also: why are we accepting this just because we know what Sony is likely to thinking? Ive never understood the complacency angle when people defend companies. Just because we know they want to make a profit doesn't mean we should sit by and not demand changes. We're the customer, we pay for their company..... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  yes please As a PC gamer, I just want to see everyone playing together, so that my friends can play with each other. I don't think people will switch platforms just to play with their friends if both sides have similar amount of players. Monkey balls  This has to happen! Bump.  What the fuck y'all we still need this Correction, both are willing to cross play with PCs. Not each other. I crossplay everyday- Paragon for PS4. Developers decide I imagine. As the market leader, Sony has no incentive to allow cross play as it will sure up the player base on other platforms. Suddenly it would be viable to play on a non Sony platform because you can play with PlayStation people. Better to keep it locked down and starve the other platforms out. your an idiot OP When Microsoft were doing fine last gen they shut this prospect down immediately.

Now Sony is in the lead they're doing the same and apparently they're evil.  Can I have a hug from a Sony player? - Xbone player Jake2701 For the love of god, please let me play cross-platform with my friends. I've already invested into PC-related things, and they console-related.

The major selling point with me would be the allowance of mouse-keyboard in the console realm. Either by cross-platform or being directly enabled on a console. I'm mainly a co-op player, so I have no windy argument of "mouse n board vs controller in pvp multiplayer which-is-better-and-stomps-the-other." I just want to play Siege or Halo horde mode with my friends. 

BETTER YET IF THEY RE-INTRODUCE WORTHY CO-OP CAMPAIGNS! Epic is doing this with paragon in beta!! Paragon is cross-platform with PC fully and it's fantastic! The developers of Rocket League and MS said it was a go... Sony said no after blue ballin everyone for months. MS first proposed this and then yhe developers went ahead and said it was a go until Sony pulled back. For shame really.  All it would take is a developer to use their own servers instead of XBL or PSN for it to work flawlessly.

MS and Sony are unlikely to work together for this as it does absolutely nothing for them. Sony is beating the fuck out of Microsoft in online gaming, so why would they take a step back and make it even. PCgamers are gamers too! Please include us, we're not all asshats, I mean aside from the time I slept with your mother! At 1:16:16 of the [GiantBombcast 442](http://www.giantbomb.com/podcasts/giant-bombcast-442-hair-products-and-turkey-bacon/1600-1690/), Jeff along with Adam Boyes (formerly of Sony Computer Entertainment of America), and Dave Lang (of the Lang Zone(tm)) talk about Cross Play.

It's not as simple a solution as you might think! I also really want online games to go mutilplatform. It will help more games stay alive and more gamers can play together. If they did this, this would be better for gaming as a whole. What ever happened to Mouse/Keyboard play on the Xbox One?!  PC's built the FPS genre and all us oldtimers get the shaft.  ....tired of being beat by my thumbstick wielding nephews!

- Grumpy Old Man If they cared what people were into they wouldnt have moved away from split screen multiplayer.  I too would lie to see these platforms able to play with my PC. I would so love to pawn some dude and tell him the reason I and owning his ass is because they are playing on a PlayStation. Or just get a PC.

Hands down: Consoles don't really serve a purpose anymore and remove everything that once made them useful. Nowadays they are just PCs with a restricting OS. Microsoft even went the way of making the Xbox more of a multimedia device than a gaming console. Nintendo is fusing its own with a handheld, doing something you can't easily do with the PC. Sony is the last company grasping at the old system.

Crossplatform between both seems rather unnecessary at this point. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE I bought an xbone last week as i got tired of waiting. Sony is saying it's a possibility but it's really left up to the developers to have this feature. Microsoft is essentially saying the same thing. From what I remember, Microsoft said yes right away and openly said they were waiting on Sony, which I feel might have just been a cheap shot towards Sony   I haven't heard anything otherwise since then  Sony can't even make it so we can change our names. Think this is even possible .... My friend sent me [this](http://vgpwn.com/you-can-now-play-cross-platform-with-ps4-players-on-xbox-live/) yesterday. I'm assuming it's false? Well honestly I never understood what Sony has to gain from it ? Why the hell would they ? The only people that would be happy about this move are their competitions consumers. That's also only because now they don't have a reason to purchase their product. Don't mistaken my opinion, of course I wish they would but from a business stand point there's literally no reason to. Wouldn't Sony, MS, etc save money by not sinking as many resources into making each multi-platform title fit with their individual console's specs? Or at least have to worry less about that?

Just curious -- I admit ignorance on this issue. Yeah, unless Sony and Microsoft allow the consoles to talk to one another there's not really anything a dev can do about it. They ARE useless, they outright lied to their customers when they first launched and never added the mods and many other promised features all while increasing the price for their online. It's despicable, I've had my PS4 for years but I think it's time to switch to Xbox.  You can play Rocket League with PC on PS4 aswell. You've got to see it from their perspective though. I'd love cross platform but it'd be a pretty bad business move for Sony if they did allow it to happen. One of the main factors in the decision making process of buying a console is what your mates are playing on, take that out of it and Sony lose a decent advantage they have over Microsoft considering they sold more consoles and have the bigger play base (I think, I could be wrong).  What with the whole "Play Anywhere" Microsoft is running at the moment, any future Play Anywhere and MP game they release will have cross platform between PC and Xbone. Doesn't surprise me that they're open for other developers to do this too when they're doing it themselves. It just adds more benefits to their ecosystem.

I am surprised however that Sony are the ones blocking this, as they've historically been quite open with cross platform play (look at FFXIV for example). And gears of War 4 Innumerable stars 

Won't tell us where to go...  Phantasy Star Online wasnt just a game, it was an experience. Dreamcast was ahead of its time. Quake 3 on the Dreamcast supported cross-platform multiplayer. both these consoles can do cross with pc There are two types of people in this world, people who haven't played PSO, and people who loved it. 4x4 Evo too. That worked with Dreamcast, PC, and Mac That's exactly the reason, each console has its advantages and disadvantages, but currently, with more PS4s sold, "playing with friends" is a bigger advantage on the PS4.

If they open up and allow full cross-play, they lose that extra advantage. As a pc gamer, I just want to play with other ps4 and xbox one players once in a while. Some games would actually live on a little more if this happened, like Battleborn or the first Titanfall.  How would that even work? Two different types of profiles? This seems like way too much time and money for MS and Sony to invest for a relatively small return. Seriously. I want to play Halo with my Xbox friends, but why can't I play battlefield, Destiny, FIFa and NHL with my PS4 friends?  Preach Fight Night pls.  So let's set a fire under their pants and tell them they need to stop being stuck in their ways. The industry is evolving. Change or get stuck in the past. In my opinion Sony has been making bad decision for the last couple months. The PS4 Pro being a prime example.  Last gen it was reversed so let's not act like this is exclusively a Sony issue.  Unless we, as consumers, boycott Sony until they give in! Pc is always open.  > PC is open to this idea as well,

PC isn't a company. It's always open to everything by *definition* :P Games live or die based on their player base. Uniting the player base could mean having a game live for longer. This could make economical sense if there was a form of monetization. Rocket League devs wouldn't have even reached this point in the conversation if Sony hadn't made a business decision to make RL a free game months ago. This could already be accomplished. Everybody in the tourney plays on a PC, Xbox players use a USB Xbox controller, PS4 players use a USB PS4 controller. That's really what it boils down to. There are legal reasons for this. The terms of service for PSN I'm pretty sure still states, and I'm paraphrasing, "you will not experience contact with any third-party networks unless sanctioned by Sony Computer Entertainment". Also Sony and Microsoft both run their own online services, so they both own these respectives services. Interacting between the two would mean renegotiation of the copyright and legal use of each network.

Also money, if consoles can communicate with each other across different online services how can Sony or Microsoft justify games like Uncharted or Halo being exclusive to their respective platforms? You *can* fart in an elevator, but you probably won't be welcomed back in again.  [Nah, there isn't a technical reason. Sony is simply saying no.](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/rocket-league-ps4-xbox-one-cross-network-play-now-ready-for-release-only-needs-sonys-approval) Plenty of business reasons though.

Let's say Sony allows it. Everyone plays together. MS can then start introducing MS-only features available to only Xbone users like integration with Windows/Windows Live/... etc.

After awhile Microsoft's "feature set" becomes the "standard" and it's a standard that Sony can't match - Microsoft owns Windows, Sony won't get to integrate with it as well as MS could.

[Embrace, extend, and extinguish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish) Those who fail to learn from history will end up repeating it. [Microsoft almost never makes deals in good faith.](http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20071023002351958) I don't think it's not so much of a technical thing than it is a legal thing at this point. Rocket Leage has said they have cross platform gaming between Xbox and PS4 figured out if they got the go ahead.... They COULD just say fuck it and let it go live but you're running into a lot of risky business doing that behind the backs of people who don't want it happening right now. Have you thought about the idea that MAYBE Xbox had to do all that stuff because the PS4 was already doing it and ahead of them? Remember the huge backlash when we found out you couldn't borrow your friend's disc and play it on your XB1? PS4 let you do that from the get go and still does.

Literally everything youve mentioned minus the modding, PS4 was doing it from the beginning. From the lack of DRM, to the price point of the consoles, even the console specs, PS4 has had the edge over the XB1.

Xb1 shot itself in the foot from the get go and everything since then has been about catching up to the PS4.  > I don't see a single reason that gamers wouldn't want this...

The only thing I can think of is that it might have unbalanced competition.  If one platform allows users to perform better, than getting into an online game without control of whether your competitors are on an advantageous platform might get annoying.

I'm not really trying to argue with you.  Just trying to think of reasons why games might not want it. Developers have to choose if they will support this and if there is no demand for customers than why would developers waste the time and money? That's why we should talk about it more. It's beneficial to dev sales. I have skipped out on a multiplayer game in the past because anyone I would have played it with were on a different ecosystem. That's a loss of sale for the dev. I like them having separate Eco systems. It creates more competition which is better for consumers Wouldn't we all... Unless we have the Xbox Live app, we can't connect with consoles.  To be fair, Sony has a lot more to lose than Microsoft. The PS4 has far outsold the Xbox One, meaning the Xbox people would benefit most by Sony allowing cross-platform play. That, and Microsoft has its hands in both the PC and console spaces, so allowing all of those devices to interact with each other seems like a logical step for them. Sony can't allow the PS4 to be "downgraded" to just another device, otherwise its purpose for existing will have largely been lost.  Its not too difficult to guess what's happening. 

Sony is in the lead (by a lot) so they have no incentive to do cross play. If there are a ton of PS4s out there, most likely the friend you want to play with is on PS4. Why give you an option to get Xbox instead when they can force you to also buy a PS4?

Xbox basically did this too back in 360 with final fantasy 11 I believe.  The PS4 supports mouse and keyboard. It's just the games aren't programmed to to use them. I've used them with Final Fantasy XIV a few times. Except everyone without a mouse and keyboard would get destroyed in FPS games That's a horrible idea for consoles, you would be at a massive disadvantage if you did not have a KB+M But then you'd just have a shitty pc at that point Yeah, but the possibility to do both is an option that's been discussed so they should consider.

Psn:whizbang-4dub You might play co-op, but others don't! Rocket League already use their own servers and they said the feature is ready but Sony isn't just allowing it yet.  It's all on sony's side, long drawn out issue short; Microsoft called out Sony for not allowing cross platform play and Sony said it's not as easy as that. Then rocket league did it and Sony says no. They wouldn't be allowed to do that I imagine.  KB + M decimates controller. They wouldn't stand a chance! >It's not as simple a solution as you might think!

Psyonix (Rocket League devs) have already said that they have it all set to go and just need Sony to say "ok" for them to enable Xbox-PS4 cross-play. The rocket league devs said they have it working but Sony isn't allowing it. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vg247.com/2016/07/21/if-sony-says-yes-rocket-league-ps4-xbox-one-cross-play-could-begin-in-a-few-hours/amp/?client=safari Sony has flatly refused. It'd be up and running 15 minutes after they gave the green light. Ms actually went the extra step and made the necessary back end changes to Xbox live to allow cross play with any platform for any developer. Sony hasn't done the same though.  False. 

Sony said that until Microsoft called them on it and gave the go ahead, now Sony are on the "we'll see in the future" fence which basically is an easier way for them to say no.  nah son, this is on sony.  at least for rocket league. > Sony is saying it's a possibility but it's really left up to the developers to have this feature. 

So what they're really saying is "it's not our fault it doesn't work", they are avoiding the responsibility here. It's like when you call comcast to complain about packet loss and they blame the servers of the game you're playing. 

Maybe 10 more years of this and some progress can be made. 
 No, Sony are not saying anything other than "we allow cross play with PC!" over and over. A few developers now have come out saying that Sony are preventing their game from being xbox-playstation cross play.  Dev here, Sony are fine with cross platform to everything but the Xbox platform. PS4->PC is fine, even PS4->iOS but not Xbox. 

It's a bit of a pain, as we'd love to make our game fully cross platform, we're coding for it anyway and just hoping they change their mind later on  With PS4 having more marketshare, would it be in Sony's best interest to allow cross play? It doesn't surprise that Microsoft would favor it, since they gain their audience a large base of online players. Sony, however, would have to share a compelling reason enough to get a PS4 - the ability to play with your friends who, most likely, have a PS4. Microsoft definitely holds to that opinion, and doesn't try to stop it. They had a game called Shadow Run that I used to play, very fun online action FPS, my first one actually. It allowed you to play with PC players even if you played on the Xbox 360. It was actually well balanced too, no way for me to tell who was playing PC or not, unless you got the achievement for reviewing someone cross-platform.  I'd say less a cheap shot and straight up honesty. Right now the only thing holding back cross-platform is Sony. No just Old the announcement was made a while ago which is the basis of the post.  -Hmmm, I like xbox exclusives. I'll just buy xbox and will play with my ps4 friends using cross-platform.

They don't want you to have freedom. Freedom means less sales. Because Sony claims they're for the gamers, that's why. "For the Players"  Sony will never do this and Microsoft knows it.

Microsoft would never do it either if they were ahead of Sony. >  Well honestly I never understood what Sony has did gain from it ?

i wanted a ps4, all my friends have the xbox one.  i bought a xbox one so i could play multiplayer with my friends.  if sony supported cross platform multi player, they would have made a sale.

that's what they would gain. > what Sony has did gain from it ? Why the hell would they ?

Good PR and not pissing off their customers? Look up game theory The devs at Rocket League have already confirmed they have code in place that will allow xbox and PS players to play with each other. It's just network related, I'm pretty sure.  I seem to vaguely recall another game is ready for this as well, but don't remember which game.  A few other devs have also shown interest in this.  Cross play between consoles I think would be another major step in the gaming industry. And honestly bring more gamers together rather than segregating them. It's been years already? Damn... Why wouldn't you just switch to PC? You can even build it yourself. I just built one using pcpartspicker and the help of reddit. It was stupidly easily and I'm not tech oriented at all. When they say it's just like using lego blocks, they're not joking.  If it's mods and support you want, move to PC.  Consoles are all about conning a quick buck. I have both and I can't remember the last time I turned on my ps4, if it weren't for my random urge to play MLB The Show every now and then. I would have gotten rid of it already.  Still can't play between Xbox and Playstation though. Play against, but not have in your party. You can also play Final Fantasy XIV (an MMO) on PS4 with PC and PS3 players as well Street Fighter V has cross-platform with PS4 and PC. Exactly, this is what I've been thinking while reading countless comments about Sony being hard to play with. In a market where so few companies own ALL of the market share for gaming consoles you can't expect them to not take advantage of the opportunity they have to own the majority of the market. It would be like having a big lead in a race and then slowing down just so fans of the other racers would still be willing to watch the end of the race. Economically speaking, there is no room for forfeiting your market advantage in the gaming console and development market. Since the majority of console owners own only one primary gaming console at a time, even a slight shift in market control instantly means millions of dollars. It's a long, long run

To the palace in the sun... I still play online on Sylverant... :D ... and people who loved it who still play.
FIFY 
 What if they didn't have the ability to play with friends, and instead, just had matchmaking open to all? The funny thing is the XB1 exclusives all have great co-op and multiplayer modes. I can't think of any big PS4 exclusive game that does this. In fairness, PC gamers have a HUGE advantage over console games, mainly FPS games. RL is fine though unless said PC gamer has a triple monitor setup. Rocket league does allow this. The limitation right now is having Xbox one and ps4 players go head to head. PC can play against Xbox and ps4.  This right here. 

Exactly the reason I'm NOT largely a PC gamer is not being able to play with my console friends.  I get that you want this done man but it won't ever happen and I don't even blame them. They would lose out on so much of our $ if they did. They don't deserve our $, but we have it to them. You're delusional if you think you can do anything about it.  You need to get off whatever power trip you're on in this thread, it's embarrassing. You're the embodiment of "we did it reddit!!!" In what way is the PS4Pro a bad decision? I'm not sure Sony has got stuck in the past. They sold more consoles, so they don't support cross-platform. They're ahead.  How does that make economical sense to a greedy amoral entity?

A game having a long life means the player isn't buying another game. > Games live or die based on their player base.

Console gaming was never about keeping playerbases alive It's all about maximizing sales in the first 2-3 weeks of release (with heavy emphasis on marketing), and then moving onto the next cash-in game.  ehh it would be a tough sell, If it was a $60 subscription for a year, maybe, but if it was a game by game basis where each game has a pass like a season pass, I couldn't see it succeeding. But again this would rely on Sony seeing it the same way as you. As they see it, they have the player base and exclusivity, as in no cross play, so why should they risk their advantage.
 Ya they even didn't want to be a ps+ game and Sony begged them and then upped the payment they would be getting.  That's the only difference is in pc vs both consoles, but that's mainly for fps games. They could make that a toggle for consoles to turn cross platform on and off like you can now for rocket league though.  Simple fix: add a toggle to enable/disable competing against players on other consoles. Rocket League already does this with PC players against console players. You have skipped out, but others have bought it on both platforms. I don't know if they would make or lose money by making everything cross platform, but for the consumer there is literally no reason to not want it. I'm sure the devs could find a way to change that part too... it's just a matter of their company allowing them to do it Back in the day i used to plug a keyboard into my PS3 when i played Little Big Planet so i could type easily because i didn't have a mic I actually used to play FFXIV on ps3 with mouse and keyboard when it was released. But regardless. I'm so used to a mouse and keyboard I almost don't want to touch my PS4. I use it for netflix and that's basically it. Imagine what it would do for the developer scene. Games that were thought to be PC exclusive due to their control scheme (RTS, Civ games, competitive fps games, League and other MOBAS). Imagine all the kids running CS:GO on their moms work computer or a shitty laptop. Now they can just get a PS4 for christmas and play 10x more games because devs don't have to change control schemes to port their titles. 

Certain games should be *keyboard only* though which is just asking for backlash. I haven't tried it, but it wouldn't surprise me if you have to make a case with Sony for a certification exemption to be allowed to ship with support. It's weird because I actually used a controller for a long time in Titanfall 1 (on PC), and was still pretty good. They obviously crank up the aim assist, but I felt as competitive with a X360 controller as I was with KB+M. > Except everyone without a mouse and keyboard would get destroyed in FPS games

[Gonna call bullshit on that.](http://puu.sh/s3r9B/ec4bffaf8e.jpg) Thats what I want! Thats what I can afford! I do...... awkward [No. It's much more complicated than that.](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kfkAV4S2hIo) Well this conversation should also be to call out Sony on their shit. 

EDIT: This got more popular than I expected. I really think we should start a fire under Sony's ass. This whole thing was really hyped up and fizzled out. 

Sony, why did you drop the ball on Rocket League? whats with sony being such party poopers lately. Skyrim mods and blocking cross platform play? People so quick to forget that MS used to be the ones against cross platform when they had the lead. 

Regardless, as long as MS and PS are selling premium connection services for online play you won't see true cross platform. How would you manage buddy lists or party chat? 

Let's put it this way, will Xbox give it's user info to Sony so they can join PS parties? Of course not. We currently have PC to PS4 crossplay with Eve or FFXIV but we wont see PS4 XBONE, it doesn't make sense with the way both companies do business.  There is no controller based advantage to that game. It's very difficult to control the ball on every platform. It's so much malarkey. I bought rocket league for PS4 and PC. My ps4 has all my sweet gear, while I play with all my friends on PC. Why can't I use one account on both systems?!?! Then lets keep bothering Sony until we get an answer. Lets use #ComeTogether on Twitter! We deserve an answer! Tweet something like...

> @Sony What is the hold up with cross platform multi-player? #ComeTogether. Im a sony gamer, but i grow quite irritated with them and their solo arrogance. 

Cant mod bethesda games as well as on Xbox1, no green light on cross platform play..

I mean do they want Microsoft to pull more gamers away from them?  Before we know it Wii will probably support cross play with ps4 (sarcasm) but they do have Skyrim on the switch which no one saw coming 😁 at least i didnt.  Not just that. When Microsoft first announced it Sony said

> PlayStation has been supporting cross-platform play between PC on several software titles starting with Final Fantasy 11 on PS2 and PC back in 2002. We would be happy to have the conversation with any publishers or developers who are interested in cross-platform play.

Making it sound like they were on board. Well, Psyonix asked them about it and Sony said no. Only in this case, it would actually be the dev's responsibility to implement correctly and, even if a dev got it to work, Sony and MS would have to trust said dev with any account information that gets sent across the two server sets. Good point, I just think the quickness of their comment was definitely an available jab so to speak   That logic goes both ways though.

"Hey, all of my friends have Xbox's, but I prefer PlayStation exclusives, so I can buy a PS4 and still play with my friends using cross-platform."

Without cross-platform, those customers are just gonna get an Xbox because they'd rather play with friends than have access to a few exclusives they want. That's what I did, I was more interested in PS4 exclusives but most of my friends had Xboxes. Exactly. It is true on PC gaming as well. Split screen games aren't split screen for some annoying ass reason when you buy them on PC. I was so excited when I saw Don't Starve Together on sale but then I looked up that they'll only be doing split screen on PS4. I can't play split on Left 4 Dead and that shits been out for ages and has mods... It is so annoying Which is funny, (and yes I realize, your point) because things like timed exclusives, and refusing to do x-platform, is _very_ antigamer as a whole. It's not even "if"; when MS were ahead with the 360 they wouldn't allow cross-console play, hence no FFXIV on 360 or Xbox One, and Steam-console co-op on Portal 2 only showing up for PS3 release. Even if Sony said yes, Microsoft has been in a similar situation with OpenGL and totally screwed them over. The problem is you are a minority. It was only as of July that they lost the number one spot on sales figures in every Nation. They are #1 in sales still in UK and in Japan. Many argue the only reason why they aren't #1 right now in the US is because of the PS4 Pro. If majority of consumers are buying PS4, why would they give a reason to not buy one? They don't need to worry about that when everyone's buying their shit. It's Sony, not some indie start up. CD Projekt said the same: 
>  "Our upcoming Gwent: The Witcher Card Game will launch in closed beta for PC and Xbox One later this year, and Microsoft already confirmed Gwent's cross-play feature not only between Xbox One and PC, but also other consoles if they allow it. We also do have a technical solution in place for PS4 and would love to add Sony’s platform to cross-play at the start of open beta. All we need is a green light from Sony."

 3 years this year. Which technology-wise is pretty long damn Because console gaming is much simpler. This is coming from someone that just got a new gaming PC, but still purchased Skyrim SE for Xbox even though I had it for free on PC. But if they really do want mods, they should definitely switch to PC.  Console = $250, maybe cheaper. 


PC = $500, very likely more for a decent rig. 


Also, it's not as easy as you make out. Go out /r/buildapc and you can find plenty of posts where people have fucked it up and pissed away a couple of hundred dollars. But you know what's even easier? Plugging a console into a mains, and a HDMI cable into a TV. It's the whole reason consoles exist, easy of use and access, and it's the reason there is a casual gaming market, and why gaming is as big as it is right now. I get what your saying but there is A LOT of conning on PC (as you would imagine on an open marketplace.)

For example, just look at green light, paid mods, gambling, reselling stolen codes, broken games on release... Recently I've been thinking about doing this. Do you know where I might find some info on building a PC and making it an awesome experience? Conning?  Explain pls. Also most Xbox exclusives (I think all) are now coming to PC. Microsoft also hinted at Halo for PC. This is believable with the release of Forge.  There's a difference between wanting it and needing it.

I can live without mods no problem.  I really don't care about them that much.  But since they are now showing up on consoles, when I see the Xbox getting the ability to do so much more with them than the PS4, it annoys me. For the money you would need to invest in an Xbox (system, games, controllers) you should consider a PC, especially if you are doing it for the mods. Nowadays there are directions for everything and installing most mods are as easy as clicking a button. Try going to /r/skyrimmods if you are interested whatsoever :) That seems odd. What makes a game with 4 PC players and 1 XBox player look different from a game with 5 PC players from the perspective of a Playstation? You still can't be in a party crossplatform  either Which is, for all intents and purposes, useless With hopes and dreams, 

Our ship will cross the sea... If you ever get PSO2 on the PC, be sure to add Crestia-bell!  I definitely think that's the best choice. Larger player pools means more longevity for multiplayer, which is always good.  How does a triple screen setup benefit rocket league? You can make new PC friends =) I'm guessing because it doesn't play 4k bluray Yes, my point is that maybe there were others who didn't buy the game because they had no one they wanted to play with. Fortunately now I have every system (but mainly play PC). Sure we can all silently want this and maybe developers will do it, but 8 months ago it was a newsworthy topic that fizzled out and no one is talking about. If the tech is there let's talk about it and move developers to do it. I for one think it is exciting. I buy all competitive shooters on PC but I would love to play with my PS4 friend who I haven't played a shooter with in years. I have no desire to play Overwatch on a console. 

 Heh I did this with a USB keyboard on my 360 when my microphone broke.  The whole point is that Sony and MS ARE supporting them. The developers are not.

The SNES had a mouse and keyboard.  
It was natively supported on the PS2.

I'm sure it's natively supported on the PS3, PS4, Xbox360 and XboxOne. It's probably supported on most other systems and platforms.

At least on a technical level.

Keyboards and mice are supported on consoles the same as controllers are supported on PC, but none of that matters if the developer doesn't use it and support it. I've had this experience with battlefield 1 also. I've done pretty well with a controller on PC. I'm just not into pc gaming as much anymore so kb/m isn't my strong suit. I might be at a disadvantage against a team of pros, but in random conquest games I don't get destroyed like most people imply. Why? Fuck Sony, im done with them after the Fallout 4 mod bullshit. How fucking obtuse can they be?  The PS4 can only run textures and sounds in ONE certain format? I had no idea Sony was so ridiculously incompetent. Because Sony doesn't want cross platform play?  Consoles will NEVER unite cross-platform like this, and people need to see these PR statements for what they are -- corporate posturing and goading one's competitor.  Microsoft and Sony have spent decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to establish product identities for their consoles, and they're not about to start working together to appease a fraction of customers asking to play Rocket League together, especially considering the PS4 is outselling the XBOX One four-to-one. why? microsoft was against it when they were the leading console and sony was for it. now it's swapped. it's not gonna happen, both companies are shitty and whoever is ahead never wants to do it I'd like to point out that situation was reversed last generation. Sony was completely open to cross platform while Microsoft had the majority, and also encouraging and in some cases enforcing that there be no cross-platform play.

The technology to go cross-platform has been there as long as online play has been a thing, and devs have been open to the idea just as long, if not longer. To be fair, some of their reasoning on why they've been striving to maintain a closed platform makes sense. They don't want another ps3 debacle to happen again This isn't really anything new.  Sony's business model has always kind of been throw their weight and money around until they get their way.  Hence why they make so many stupid proprietary formats and all that. Sony has always been this way. They capitalised on some bad Xbox One PR and tricked a whole bunch of people into thinking they were for the gamers.  No idea seems to be a different direction than the PS3 for sure  Skyrim mods are now coming. Sort of. Mods will be allowed as long as they use original assets in the game. Actually... It does. You only need to be able to make groups and party's within the game itself. I wouldn't expect console level cross platforming, just game level.

 > People so quick to forget that MS used to be the ones against cross platform when they had the lead.
> 

I don't think this is the case so much as it is that people are willing to forgive them now that they're on board and condemn Sony now that they've changed their tune. Gamers want cross-platform play. Always have. Always will. Whoever wants it is "on our side," whoever doesn't is "being a dick." It would work the same way it does with PC, no voicechat and you either just join at random or use a code for private matches.  i remember a dev video for destiny where they stated there was nothing on their end stopping a ps4 character from loading into a lobby with an xbox one character

on their server side everything is essentially stored the same, just marked to be used by a certain platform

so someone here is lying. If they are both saying its up to the devs, and the dev of Destiny is saying they can do it with permission. Why doesnt destiny have cross platform play? It's on Sony for sure. Psyonix have said that they are 100% ready to activate cross platform and so have MS. Just Sony left in the way. Developers would just use a separate account for that kind of stuff. Think of something like an MMO or whatever. It may automatically tie your account for that game to the platform account, i.e. Xbox Live or PSN but the devs would still have a separate account created on their end.

Players from PSN would then communicate with the game accounts of people on XBL instead of the XBL account directly. It's also how XB 360 can play with XB One.

Point is, third party accounts tied to platform accounts have existed for awhile now. Yes, but from Sony's perspective the PS4 is destroying Xbone in sales. Cross platform would benefit Xbone users way more the PS4 users.  Pretty sure this is largely due to not being able to connect multiple keyboard/mice and have them work separately from one another without special software. 

It could also be much harder for a PC game to reach reasonable frames with split screen. Yes, your GTX 1080 quad SLI shit can run it at over 9000 fps, but someone using a GTX 750 wouldn't get near the results. Yes, you could set the minimum/recommended specifications for split screen gameplay, but you're always going to get those ignorant gamers that can't read calling an complaining because their computer meets said "specifications." It's much easier to reach optimized results with a system that is always the same for everyone. 

Even if it's possible now either controllers they are likely sticking with the "legacy" of PC games not being split screen because of the above problems.

I'm in no way saying this is a good thing, but I believe that's the developers mindset.  The head of Xbox was a completely different dude then. The new head would certainly allow cross platform play even if they were ahead. He's done some amazing things to turn it around for microsoft.  Yup. And the PS4 wasn't exactly using cutting edge stuff to begin with. I think people are going to be very surprised at the Nintendo Switch's performance level. It's not going to catch up to the PS4 Pro or Scorpio, by any means, but it should be competitive with the current gen, while also being portable. I'm hyped. If you just plug in a controller then its basically the same as a console . I have my desktop PC connected via HDMI to my 55" TV where I sit on my couch playing games with my wireless xbox 360 controller that natively works with the games. The difference between a console and this experience is trivial and with PC I get way better graphics.  Yes, I can understand that consoles are much simpler. But in reality, the advantages of PC gaming far outweighs the benefits of a console being "simple." And now that there are things like steam boxes, it's easier than ever to be able to use your living room TV as a place to game, just like you would on a console. The modding capabilities alone, especially for Skyrim, is why I switched to PC. I literally built a PC to play Skyrim SE, because my old gaming laptop wouldn't be good enough. But hey, maybe I take gaming way too seriously, haha.  You're not wrong, but a lot of this is avoidable.

[EDIT] Sorry for the cheap comment... I was on my phone and not in the mood to type.

1. Greenlight - I'm not sure I follow how this is an issue, but I'm open to hearing more about how it is an issue.  To me, it seems like a decent  way for Steam to give the community a say, but I understand how it can be gamed.

2. Paid mods - this was a thing very briefly.  Then Steam realized that they done goofed and reneged, and everything went back to normal.

3. Gambling - Is this not also possible via console gaming?  It's also worth pointing out that this is a really niche thing and (as far as I am aware) is generally looked down on and mainly just a thing for con artists and suckers.

4. Reselling stolen codes - this is definitely a legitimate concern, and I believe the same thing has happened with Xbox and PlayStation credits as well.  Unfortunately, this problem isn't platform specific and it really is a buyer beware kind of situation, and with the shift to digital downloads instead of physical discs the risk will only get higher.  Regardless of the platform, we all need to be really cautious of where we are purchasing our codes from.

5. Broken games on Release - this one is also entirely possible on every platform, and it's a huge reason why people always try to protest pre-ordering games.  It literally gives developers the option to release shit and patch it as they go. You get broken games on release on consoles as well. If a multiplatform game is broken on one of them, its often broken on all of them. Its just there are lots more PC only games, hence you hear about more of them. Examples of these include Skyrim, Halo Master Chief Collection, GTA Online, Assassins Creed Unity and Battlefield 4.

Reselling stolen codes happens on every platform where a code can be redeemed for something. It just uses a stolen credit card to buy something, which is then sold to hide the trail. It's not limited to PC gaming by any stretch of the imagination.

Also I wouldn't consider gambling as conning. Its shitty and wrong, but it isn't a con as such. The main reason its so bad is that it isn't regulated at all which means that its very easy for underage players to join in without knowing the risks. Afaik, its no worse than other forms of gambling as far as stakes/rewards go. But please correct me if I'm wrong.

Greenlight is bad agreed, but I would consider 'Early access' as being just as bad if not worse. Both have resulted in the occasional gem, but most of the stuff is terrible. At least now with the steam refunds system we're protected against this much more now, which you aren't on other platforms.

Paid mods was the worst idea ever, but it lasted such a short amount of time and everyone was refunded so...

So yeah, I see what you're getting at, but it's not as bad as you may think if you look at it in context. Paid mods got shut down and really bloody fast. If it were the console community, that shit would have stuck. Green lights? What about em? You're taking the same gamble with them as you are buyimg a new game. Other than that, PC is generally better in all aspects. 

And if you think gambling and stolen codes aren't apart of the console community, you have a lot to learn.  Thing is, PC is also about keeping each other informed. Any kind of bad deal, scam, broken game, etc blows up FAST instantly across reddit, youtube, review aggregators, social media, etc. 

For example No Man's Sky sold an incredible number of copies on PS4 purely due to console players falling for Sony's elaborate marketing. But on PC it sold bugger-all copies because people were relatively well informed and had already started suspecting the game was over-promising what it could deliver.

Basically the level of "bullshit tolerance" in PC communities is very low, and standards are relatively high.

Quoting a great man called Yahtzee:

> It's true, I didn't like Brawl before I even started playing, but then the same is true of every game, object, animal and human being I encounter these days. Since the Internet is almost diametrically opposed to the notion of quality control, in recent years it's been a lot easier to just assume everything's shit until it can prove itself otherwise. I like to call it the "Guantanamo Bay" approach to reviewing.  I gave you a really shitty reply earlier, sorry about that.  I've updated it.  [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5akwue/8_months_ago_microsoft_and_sony_both_said_they/d9hrxik/) Paid mods don't exist. The PC community fought Bethesda and we won.  What? Conning?

Other than that one paid-mods thing (which was BETHESDA doing it) I don't know what you're talking about. Modding is pretty safe and easy unless you've somehow found yourself onto a site that packages viruses in with mods? Just use Nexus or the Steam Workshop. /r/buildapc  r/helpmebuildapc Ask at r/buildapc 

Get super fucking sweet deals and build a monster for cheap using r/buildapcsales 

Use sites like www.pcpartpicker.com to get a good idea for the prices and builds that will work for what you want (there are some guides there too for baselining but you gotta research). 

Someone from the subreddits dedicated to PC builds will point you out to their guides and wikis, and also searching those subreddits will lead to tons and tons of PC builds from whatever year you are looking at.

Or if you have shit tons of money, just drop $$$$$ on a falcon northwest and you'll be set, though building a PC is far cheaper.

Oh and youtube tutorials basically cover everything you'll be doing when it comes to putting it together. If you have some computer knowledge you should be able to build one. You buy the machine, you pay for household internet, you pay for online, odds are you pay full price for games. On PC you buy the machine, buy the internet then pay less for the games. There's humble bundle, GOG, steam sales. On consoles they make you pay for more. Like seriously, why should people pay for internet on top of internet? Yeah that ia pretty lame.  I honestly dropped off the console bandwagon a few years ago.  Is the XBONE using some deviant form of Windows?  If so, the mods mat be easier to port over as well. It's not a technical reason. Right now Sony has more consoles sold, if I'm looking to buy a console to play RL with my friends, and most of them have a PS4, I would have to buy a PS4. So they don't allow the devs to implement full cross-play.

Edit: Like some of you have mentioned, you still can't make a party with your friends in other platform when cross platform is enabled. In Rocket League the only way to play with your friends is private matches.

Another consideration, though, is the number of players online. Say Playstation has 50k and Xbox 30k, Playstation has an advantage, if they allow cross play then both platforms have 80k players and Playstation no longer has that advantage. Which makes it useless when you want to matchmake. Me and my buddy did this (me on xbox and him on PC) and it was fun for a few rounds, but we couldn't party up and couldn't go into matchmaking to play with others, so just constant 1v1 matches. We haven't even bothered trying to play together since. Correct! To the whole new world 

Shining like a Pearl 

The whole new world
 Field of view. I mean, there are stats that show that physical 4k bluray sales are declining and more people are using 4k streaming.  Sony probably knows this better than anyone since they behind bluray.

 Yeah, I don't know what the fuck Sony is doing. They seem to be trying to cut ties with random big developers and alienate themselves. Curious to know why, seeing that what you mentioned would be mutually beneficial.  They did it to protect their proprietary tech in the PS4. I agree they are making a mistake, but their reason for doing so isn't just so they could be a dick or that they are just stupid. I'm with you on that! I just would like my friends who enjoy Sony to play with me. I haven't thrown money at them in over a year. This mod shit is ridiculous. Happy to have switched to PCMR.  I'm about to buy a refurbished xbox one with skyrim and fallout because I hate how limited my ps4 is. It's extremely frustrating I'm pissed about it, too, but they have suffered quite a few scandals with customer credit cards so you can't fault them for being careful that it doesn't happen again. Why be mad at sony for something that wasnt intended in the initial ps4 design lol I'm going to have to defend Sony here, they're definitely not incompetent. Only using textures and sounds in one format is a key design feature that helps the console run consistently smooth. But its players that fund it's entire business do! No that can't be it, Sony must be literally Hitler instead > Playstation Four

> Xbox One

> outselling four-to-one

Hmmmm....
 Nar fuck it let's ignore the past 15 years of both companies bullshit tomorrow they are going to merge and end the console wars Microsoft are a much better company than they were 5 years ago, especially with Xbox. They've become a lot more focused on gamers, and having everything open. I mean they're putting every Xbox exclusive onto PC now aswell. Sony seem to be doing the exact opposite, and we should call them out on it.  Sony has cross platform since the PS2 days when they were dominating. There's probably another reason as to why they won't allow it. Exactly. If Microsoft were the console market leader right now, they'd be dead set against this. I'm not surprised that Sony has the same mentality. Companies are REAL friendly and accommodating when they aren't #1.  People always say this but they never provide a source to back it up. 

Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and PC were all able to play FFXI together so I think it's wrong to say Microsoft were completely against the idea.   Sony has had cross platform play since the PS2 days. What was the ps3 debacle? Also the leader always is against crossplay, last generation it was Sony who suggested crossplay while Microsoft denied it Sony's PR
>EA Access isn't a good value for our gamers Well, I remember years ago when Sony wanted this and MS wanted nothing to do with it because they were on top at the time.  Let's not pretend like one is the good guy and one is the bad guy, they will both do whatever favors them. CD Projekt RED said the same. Gwent is all set up for crossplay. Microsoft has given permission, Sony hasn't. Which would be fine if weren't for the fact that the only thing keeping the PS4 ahead is all the early launch sales . IIRC for the past few months, XB1 has been ahead in sales Too true. I have a ps4 but need to get an xb1 to play bf1 and other multiplayer games because most of my friends have an xbox. Cross platform play would prevent me from buying the competition. A win for MS. Exactly right. Basically a 'why fix it if it ain't broke' scenario Well to get split screen with Left 4 Dead on PC, you have to copy and paste about 40 lines of very simple code (e.g. when controller 2 presses forward analog, go forward. When controller 2 presses back go back, and so on). Then you type in 4 lines into the console command, and presto, the Xbox 360 controller works... Almost like the coding for it was put into the game then removed after for the PC version. 

Other methods that I used before I knew about the console command had you plugging the controller in at just the right time before the loading screen. Again, the only code that was added were the commands for controller 2. 

So no, the devs weren't limited by the extreme difference between an Xbox (a computer) and a PC (a computer). It was just another asshole business strategy. 

And in terms of power, the Xbox 360 ran it on split screen and looked just fine, and that is not a very powerful machine.  Well, i have personally run a few games split screen on a G3258/750ti combo myself. Specifically TF2,CSGO,CSS and Halo Online. 4 player splitscreen works great at a capped 60FPS for the source games. Halo Online worked at up to two players, but I was limited by 8GB of RAM. I feel it should be workable on an average gaming rig IMO I love how hindsight is 20/20 on these posts.

"IF THINGS WERE DIFFERENT, THEY TOTALLY WOULD HAVE DONE X OR Y!" I don't think you understand. It's business. There is absolutely no way the current head of xbox agrees to cross play if they weren't playing catch up. In fact, I think the only reason he says they're down for it is because he knows Sony would say no, making Sony look like the bad guy even though MS doesn't want true cross play either.  Don't call them out on it, they'll come up with some other way to say "I'm uncomfortable sitting in front of my PC". Literally the comfort of the chair itself I think is the actual point to make. It you just want simple, a PC will never be better than a console. On a console, any game you buy will just work. The most you'll do in any settings is adjust brightness and turn on subtitles. But if you even slightly care about performance you'll have a much better experience on a good PC. I'm not saying it's super complicated to play on PC, just that it's more work than just buying a game, sticking it in, and playing. Steam usually filters out most of it thru reviews (on the meta level) and their policies.

And of course if something goes wrong the community makes memes about it until valve begs them to stop and fixes it. Also, most of those problems also exist on console. While I thinks there more advantages to PC, I think the games sales aren't one of them. I literally have saved hundreds of dollars only buying games on sale on my Xbox (a notable one off the top of my head is battlefield 4 with all the dlc for $15. That was about a year ago). I have 80 something games and haven't payed full price on a single one except a handful. On top of that, both consoles have free games each month. I can't speak for PS4, but xbone actually has some pretty solid titles on there every so often. They are usually shitty indie games, but I've picked up ac:black flag, fable, halo reach, and several other good games for free. You don't have to pay full price for anything on console unless you want it literally right when it comes out It runs a version of win10 The consoles are running the same architecture as far as I know.

Sony is just placing more restrictions on how much HDD space they can use as well as the ability to use external assets.  MS is allowing it while Sony is only allowing mods that only use current in-game assets, probably because they are worried about security issues.

There were also rumors a month or two ago regarding Fallout 4 mods that Sony wanted Bethesda to personally test every single mod to make sure that they wouldn't break the game or the console.  Obviously that's an insane request requiring tons of man hours, so Bethesda would have said no. Right, I guess my question is, how can they tell if the devs have done this? Or as an alternate technical question is it a thing that the devs have to specifically restrict, or is it a thing that Sony just has to "turn off" in the Xbox firewall? Well no matter what the majority of your friends have you'd have to buy that system in order to play with them.  You can't add friends cross platform, only encounter them in matchmaking. Well, if I'm playing Rocket League on PS4, yes we get in games against PC players, but if I wanted to actually play "with" my friends, they have to be on PS4 

So PS4 still has that going Weird In other words, Microsoft isn't objecting to cross-play because they have sold less consoles and they STAND TO GAIN FROM IT.  Yeah 4k steaming is awesome unless a) you have shitty internet speeds(most of the world) 

b) you have shitty internet caps (most of the world)

or

c) you want uncompressed video and/or proper surround sound.

I'm all for Netflix, I love it, but I won't ever stop buying physical media for movies I love.

^^^inb4 ^^^coolstorybro They are being very japanese corporation lately. Sony basically denied EA access because they believe PS Now offered a better value. 😕 It's a far cry from the Sony we saw announce the PS4, back when they were trying to make the gamer's dream console. They are going the route of Nintendo, while Nintendo seems to be coming into the limelight.  people usually buy the console where all their friends are and given that most are on the ps4 sony has that advantage.If you introduce cross platform it gives people reason to choose xbox one instead They're becoming overly Nintendo lately. If I was Sony I would not allow cross platform because I have the market share right now. With cross platform it doesn't matter what console my friends have.  They've been this way as long as I can remember though. Granted, there have been a few exceptions (like an official PS2 version of Linux), but otherwise this is all par for the course.

But I didn't care back then because I was like 9. > Yeah, I don't know what the fuck Sony is doing.

Like releasing an upgraded PS4 but not giving it a UHD disc player like the current XBOX One model has? [deleted] PCMR Is probably the best choice I've made in a long time.  What's the mod issue? Out of the loop on that. I mean, if you're frustrated with limitations, you might as well go whole hog and get a PC. You could build a PC for the same price and you have unlimited amounts of storage for mods, and it will for sure have better graphics :) 

Edit: Plus you get to decide if you want to play with your PS4 controller, buy an Xbox One gamepad or use a keyboard and mouse That most definitely isn't why Because it's a very easy fix that they don't care enough to implement.  They clearly don't give a shit about demand.  It's not like their system is inherently incompatible, current generation consoles are extremely close to low end computers and can very easily be made to accept new formats. Putting that aside I feel like people need to expect less from consoles. They are in fact designed to follow specific guidelines that were set out quite a while ago during development. It seems like more and more people are expecting consoles to be able to do the exact same things as PCs do, but they got to keep their feet on the ground. You pay only 300 bucks for a console so you get what you pay for, anything else like mods is a giant fat bonus that wasn't part of the deal in the first place. For me, sticking to a smaller amount of formats means less bugs. If the formats are easily converted, it shouldn't be a problem for a decent modder.  They know you won't stop funding them even if they don't. That's funny, because the only people I know that own a PS own it for the exclusive titles. Xbox wasn't about cross platform play when it was in the lead with 360 over PS3. Why fill your competitor's queues and lobbies when yours are doing fine? Same thing is happening now.. Unless market share is permanently 50/50 someone will always slow the process down. Literally Sean Murray Hitler escaped the bunker, fled to Japan and stayed in hiding till he started Sony. Hitler = Sony I like you.  IT WAS FORETOLD IN THE SCROLLS Except Halo :( > I mean they're putting every Xbox exclusive onto PC now aswell

I wouldn't say that's a good example.

Every few years Microsoft gets it in their head that they can retake the PC games market that they lost to Steam.

This interest coincides with the release of a new distribution platform. Last time it was the atrocity that was Games for Windows and this time it's the Windows 10 App Store.

They then try to use Xbox exclusives to force people onto it (Halo 2 PC's arbitrary restriction to Vista is a prime example).

Ultimately they fail each time because they don't understand the PC gaming market at all and stay stuck in their console mentality. They don't care though because the real goal is to force/encourage switches to their new OS. This is the case each and every OS release. What games had cross-platform multiplayer in the PS2 era? Very few games even had online multiplayer back then.  It only ever came up with UT and Portal 2 when people started asking why. Most multiplayer games on the 360 used p2p instead of dedicated servers because those were 'free', and that was a big no-no to hook up to any ps3/pc. PSN getting hacked compromising millions of accounts, then being down for nearly a month.

Rouge Jedi above is right on point. I would love cross play but understand Sony's hesitance to open their platform after that experience Microsoft actually did cross platform, though. And it failed. They at least tried it. Sony had  cross platform play since the PS2 days. /r/xboxone Talks about how great EA Access is. Play EA games a few days early, play a new game for 10 hours before you decide to buy it, 10% off all new EA releases, EA games older than a year are free. Didn't MS do a couple crossplay games w/ PC last gen? Not worldwide sales. And it kinda makes sense that ps sales are slipping with the Pro on the horizon. Xbone has been outselling PS4 2 to 1 for nearly half a year now. People are slowly coming to realize there is no value in PS4 and there's nothing good to play. All the good games are on xbone these days and they consistently deliver. 

There hasn't been an exclusive worth mentioning on PS4 since bloodborne  Remember, this is the same guy that pushed and delivered on backwards compatibility with the 360 despite it being a basically zero-profit end result that continues to tie up a lot of resources, but boy did it build some rapport with gamers.

Dude has completely turned the Xbox division around, it is still a business, but a business run by an actual gamer. >On a console, any game you buy will just work.

I can't recall the last time I bought a AAA game on Steam that didn't work like it was supposed to. Having to dick around with drivers and adjust a plethora of system settings to play a game is mostly a thing of the past. As long as you have mainstream hardware, you're usually fine. This is the best problem solution I've ever read Its more like Sony shutting down rocket league on the ps4 if they dont do as they say So with most console games, each version ties into the multiplayer infrastructure for that specific platform (be it PSN, XBL, Steam, etc). Since Rocket League has cross play working, it seems safe to assume that yes, they simply have seen rules in place with the matchmaking to prevent PSN and XBL players connecting to the same games. They probably couldn't technically prevent it from happening if the floodgate was suddenly opened, but they could block the game, and they could stop doing business with the company that made the game. They can't though, you can't add players to a friends list cross platform, only encounter them in matchmaking.  You'd still have to buy the same system as your friends if you want to group up and play with them. SUNRISE LAND [deleted] Japanese corporations didn't merge with other TV companies, they starved them to death and laughed as they were buried. Japan is not known for being cooperative. If they were, Pearl Harbor would have been borscht harbor and the start of japan's war with the USSR I just feel Sony doesn't have the edge Microsoft has with owning another operating system used by 90% of the world, and wonder how M$ deciding to integrate the Xbone into W10 is going to affect Sony's future. Right? If it's better then let EA compete and lose to you? It sounds more like they actually are threatened by it and want to retain more control of their product. Which is all well and good when they're not restricting their users and resting on their laurels,but that isn't exactly the case. Devs are trying to innovate and Sony is scared.  Didn't they basically just wait for Microsoft to present their case first and then changed their response based on the negative feed back the X-Box got? They've won this generation, so I guess they've decided to not offer their consumers more than they have to.  We have no idea if Nintendo will be big with 3rd party devs on the Switch. They announced basically the same thing when the WiiU came out and look how that turned out. I'm cautiously optimistic. As a PS and Nintendo gamer I am saddened and delighted. Xbox seems to be doing all the right things at the moment too, which I love as well. Good competition is important and I hope Sony realizes this and stops being so incompetent about some things. That's why Sony wanted the cross platform last gen and Microsoft did deny it. But they didn't get nearly as much hate as Sony gets now. making kids games? I don't know a single person that uses 4K Blu-ray discs. Not one It's self-satire so its kind of the point. Most "PCMRs" also own consoles and play on them so its hardly a big deal to them. The only people who take it totally serious are people who don't get it. 

It's like the flat earth society. It's a joke, some people just don't get it and take it seriously.  So is PCMR going to be an official name now? wtf Not sure if OW ref or nah But console exclusives such as RDR2 would be frustrating  Some people prefer gaming on their TV and PCs require quite a bit of fiddling for that to work well That's what I did....best choice I have made so far
 I second this notion. I bought an Xbox One on a ridiculous sale. I use it occasionally, but it can't compare to my PC, that was built for gaming. 
I love my consoles. Absolutely love them. But if modding is involved? Definitely go to PC. Unlimited mods and extremely high graphics. 
And the best part is that you can upgrade as you go along. 
Don't skimp out on your graphics card (but no need to get the top of the line), and don't get a cheap power supply. Everything else can be middle of the road and do perfectly fine. And just upgrade to better quality parts as you go along. 
  A refurbished Xbox one is like $200 now, you couldn't even get a computer with any graphics card really at that price. what are you guys even talking about when's the last time you built a gaming pc? a new console is less than 300 you can't even half ass build a gaming pc plus buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse for that money  You can get a PC that's better than a console for $300? Bullshit. It would be more expensive to build a PC, for what it's worth. Better graphics and more storage for the same price?

Ehhhhhh... It's probably a couple hundred more expensive for a budget gaming PC if you're starting from scratch.  And then you'd probably only match the graphical power and storage of a console, not best it. Don't be mad, get a PC. Let your wallet speak for you, and I say that meaning don't buy Sony's bullshit. The only thing these companies care about are numbers. If you want mods play on PC? Who buys a console expecting mod support?  >Because it's a very easy fix that they don't care enough to implement.

How could you know that? The last I heard Sony wouldn't give Bethesda enough information about the PS4's operating system for Bethesda to implement mods into their games. There could be good reasons for this.

>They clearly don't give a shit about demand. 

They obviously do considering they're a multi-billion dollar corporation.

>It's not like their system is inherently incompatible, current generation consoles are extremely close to low end computers and can very easily be made to accept new formats.

You keep saying how very easy it would be to put mods on the PS4 but apparently it's not or it would have been done in the first place. It's not like Playstation Sony wants to take the 2nd place stand next to Microsoft. 
 HAHAHA You think it's an easy fix? Adding support for an audio format is so much harder than you think it is. It's not like it's a single switch you flip and suddenly your hardware supports .FLAC and .WAV files as well as compressed .MP3s. Audio playback is a hardware issue, *not* software.

Images aren't easy either. It takes a lot of time to write the libraries to support them, let alone testing them. Trust me, devs (generally) want to make a product that they can be proud of that everyone likes, but sometimes it isn't feasible.

Source: software developer. Don't tell us how to do our jobs. The mod free Sony elder scrolls that is  Final fantasy XI had cross-play between PS2 and PC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XI Could you explain how x-plattform multiplayer is related to the hacking incident? Was any vector used in the hack based on muktiplayer servers or anything like that? Probably that's why Sony won't allow external assets Fallout 4 and Skyrim mods Are people knowingly spelling it "rouge" now? It's spelled out in the very name you quoted, that has to have been a purposeful misspell right?! They tried crossplat between Xbox and PC. Sony wasn't along for that ride. 

EDIT: guys, I meant that Microsoft didn't invite Sony to participate in their particular brand of cross-play, not that Sony doesn't/hasn't done PC cross play. The point was to show that while Microsoft attempted cross-play with the 360, it wasn't console cross-play All that for a fiver a month or just 20 quid a year. Pretty sweet deal  That last part is true true?! Oh you mean both of the platforms they own? It was mostly Sony who did it. Hence, Xbox missed out FF14 where as PlayStation and PC had it. Yes, but Sony is currently doing that with rocket league
 Yeah and MS also refused to do cross platform with Portal 2, but Sony had no problems with it. MS only really needs the US, UK and a few European countries like France to switch over. Look how close the 360 and PS3 were at the end of their gens. Uncharted 4 would like to have a word with you Yes. And I've already bought 2 old ass games to play with backwards compat. If they'd backwards compat BF:BC2 and/or BF3 I'd pay a full $60 for either of them. It was a solid move in building trust with XB gamers. That would be way worse for Sony, but I guess if that's their only threat. Weird OPEN. THE COUNTRY.

STOP HAVING IT. BE CLOSED. Don't try to conquer the world. That's my Steam profile name Japan has historically been an isolationist country They do completely baffling things that outrage a large portion of their customer base with no justification provided.

See: Capcom stabbing megaman and watching him bleed out onto a sacrificial slab which they then neglected to finish the ritual for, Konami deciding they were done doing video games out of the blue with a promising silent hill game coming up. There is a japanese game company that pisses everyone off, IIRC they changed a horror game series into slot (gambling) one. W10 is hated by everyone I know, especially the gamers (I was running 7 until an update I had disabled got thru... Happened to many friends as well, most of them and myself are now on Linux). So I don't see it having a huge effect. As a lifelong Nintendo player and fan, I agree. It's sad but this has happened before, and I am cautious to get too hyped. A list of devs means nothing until there is a list of games with real release dates. Even then, it becomes a matter of continued support, lest they turn out like Ubisoft did with the Wii U, or worse.  It's interesting to see that when this console generation was starting out Sony was adored by everyone while Microsoft was met with disdain. Now it seems to be the opposite. At least that's how I've observed this. I wonder when this switch happened exactly?  I'm considering getting a PS Slim. My only worry is that they forget about the slim, and just focus on the pro. Like, i'm worried they'd abandon the slim like they did the vita.  Xbox gamer here who doesn't own/pay attention to PS and is out of the loop...what is Sony doing that has everyone so up in arms lately? Last time I paid attention to console wars (admittedly a while ago) everyone loved Sony and was spitting fire at Microsoft  > Xbox seems to be doing all the right things at the moment too, 

If the biggest complaint against either of them is they won't allow cross play, something Microsoft never did when they had the lead, then neither are doing anything wrong. I actually doubt Sony wanted cross-platform last generation either. They might have made a few off-the-cuff remarks about being open to it, but they never extended an offer or made PSN available to external *console* developers, only PC. 

Now that MS has gone ahead and released an API for other console manufacturers to connect via, Sony have gone completely silent. Back then Sony knew MS wouldn't do it so they pretended that they would but without ever actually doing anything towards making it happen. This generation they got caught with their pants down and caught in a lie because they never thought MS would allow it. I mean, there **is** a difference between kids games and games for everyone, but anyway most gamers can be a bunch of babies so they have always made kids games  Can confirm, own Xbox's, Playstations and Nintendo products. Main gaming on PC. But if a good exclusive comes out on console i'm happy enough to play it. Maybe for some, but I've seen a very large number of people who unironically believe they are superior for playing video games on PC. 

Disclaimer: I own a PC and 14 consoles.  None of them make me superior to someone else.  

Except my Vectrex, I'm kind of proud of that one. And maybe my MSX2.  .... Are you questioning a flat earth? Or like a divine being in the sky! Calling yourself a member of PCMR has gone from a joke to a completely serious statement. What is happening to the world? Sounds like a fetish or some shit  It's been like that for a while. Sounds circlejerky as fuck, but it's just a joke, for the most part. People just tend to say "I'm PCMR" to show that they play on PC.

PC gamers are the one thing I hate most about PC gaming. Woo woo you PCMR too bro? wish I could go whole hog -- bank account's ult is still charging (7%) I can't imagine RDR2 will stay console exclusive, unless they've come out and specifically said it. I'm guessing they'll take a GTAV approach and release it on PC like a year later, so suckers like me will buy it twice. :( To be fair, RDR2 will likely be hitting PC, just much later, in a classic R* cash grab. True. But PC does have quite a few exclusives as well. Honestly I use my XB1 more as a media center for my TV and my PC for games.  The Kinect is super useful to control my TV and the interface is way more intuitive when you're lying down.  I use it for Netflix/Twitch/YouTube/Plex, plus it supports casting from my phone.

When it comes to games though, that's all PC.  My PC is also hooked up via HDMI to my TV  so I can use big picture mode on Steam with the Xbox controller.  They work well together as a dual Battlestation. Initial investment sure, but not by much. For me at least, it's been much cheaper in the long run to build a PC and just upgrade a part or two every 3 or 4 years.

Edit: upgrade You can build a PC for under 375$ that is better than a ps4 If you do the math wrong I guess yeah. 

Edit: He said refurbished, I MISSED THAT AND WAS WRONG STOP REPLYING I have a gaming PC, I'm not mad about Sony burning me or anyone else, it just pisses me off that consoles effectively hold back advancements in gaming because devs have to support sub par formats and tech to cater to consoles, as well as resulting in PC getting shitty ports. How would buying a PC be letting your wallet speak?  He already presumably bought the PlayStation.  Since he's upset about mods he's probably already bought a potentially moddable game.  He would have to boycott buying the next PlayStation to let his wallet speak which won't be for years.

What he needs to do in his self interest is complain because that's all he really can do to see a system he has get better utilized to his standards, whether they are realistic or pragmatic standards or not.  It's his only real option currently. Nobody EXPECTED mod support until they were told that they could use mods on their PS4s and Xbox Ones. 

Just expecting something and being told "hey you can do this.... LOL JK" are two totally different scenarios.  A lot of people bought the Nintendo wii for its mod support. Project M, a competitive mod for Smash Bros Brawl to make it more like Melee, is so big now that it has its own championships and tournaments. Mod support is an easy thing to get for a console, especially one like the Ps4. Especially when it's handheld counterparts the PSP and Psvita have been doing it for nearly a decade.


Source: modded on the aforementioned devices. And god forbid going through the endless security cycle of "what the fuck can someone do by letting them install this new file type and run it how they want inside a game". Even once you've got it running you need to do all the security checks, and add an extra thing to check in any firmware/software updates etc etc.

Or you can set a console wide standard format. I see this same response for almost everything that has to deal with developing.  Im sorry but its your job.  I doubt its nothing more than just time consuming.  When another company(Microsoft) is willing to do something yet you don't, and the large majority of your fans want it done, then you should get it done.  It doesn't matter how difficult it is. Or you know their network is just garbage still. Final Fantasy 14 is cross platform with PS4 and PC and initially they expected PC players to pay the Xbox Live fees to play a single game against Xbox players. It was a shitshow. Sony has had cross platform play since the PS2 days. yes it is  Rocket league owes a lot to Sony. without them they would not be where they are now.  Could also be forced refunds for rocket league if it's a contract violation  Japan has closed its borders. Martial law is declared in Canada. A man coughs in Iceland. Knock knock. It's the rest of the world. OPEN. THE CROSSPLATFORMPLAY. [deleted] People keep forgetting that Sony comes from another country, that has its own customs and culture. Pretty sure satiating our salty asses isnt a part of that. adding to what you've said...


Fromsoft releasing Dark Souls 3 a whole month in advance in japan. Don't tell me that has to do with localization, the game was in development for years- if they wanted to release globally at the same exact time, they easily could have. It's their screwup. Konami Japanese gaming companies tend to not give a shit what westerners want They just decided out of the blue that they were done makign video games while they had a promising horror game in the pipeline which they completely left hanging. Dude get off the subreddit echo chamber/circle jerk. Windows 10 works fine for me as a gamer. It made my budget Frankenstein gaming pc work a hell of a lot better. Microsoft stock is doing better too, and that's the thing that manners. Hell, my computer science friends don't even use Linux.  Sony has a way of fucking up and getting cocky when they're on top. Example: PS3. When Microsoft listened to criticism and Sony didn't This. I came for this.  When Sony started getting a comfortable lead, and decided they didn't have to do as much to win over consumers. What a company feels obligated to offer their consumers is generally dictated by competition as opposed to good will. 

If Microsoft hadn't screwed up their launch I'd imagine Sony's offerings would be better.  Not a chance. The slim is just the new version of the standard PS4. They wont suddenly stop producing games for the 40 million consoles out there. They want that money.  Well the Vita is a handheld and Sony isn't as dominant in that market as they are in the console space. I'm sure they'll offer as much support for the slim as they will for the original PS4 (which idk how much that was). Sony has said a million times that the Pro is NOT going to have exclusive titles. Not sure what you're worried about. I would hold unto my cash and get the VR compatible PS, even if it costs a bit more. I have a PS4, get an XBONE they're going to forget the slim like they did the vita...

and im not saying that just cause im an xbox player. I used to have a psp and a ps2  Same here, but i normally lean towards whatever system my friends are playing at the time Yep. I own a gaming pc with a massive library, but if I want to play with friends, I recognize that console is my only route. So I own an Xbox for Destiny and Halo. I live to stomp on PS4 plebs in rocket league.

except for, you know, those crazy ones that can fly.

Seriously though, adding xbox players to the mix would be awesome. You don't know what war you started.  There are 12 year olds in every discussion online. They have the most free time, after all. It's round, like a pancake.  Wait how has it become completely serious? Its obviously satire lol, I mean the name is literally derived from Adolf Hitler's writings. I cant fathom how anyone actually takes it seriously. People just like to use it because it's a tongue in cheek way of suggesting superiority but it's so over the top no sane person would take it seriously (or at least I thought so)  Even when it was a joke, PC still had better hardware, and a better game experience with more choice. Yeah if a joke lingers on for too long it becomes a truth. Just look at /r/The_Donald. It is. You should see how big my graphics card is.  You can press F to loot me anytime, baby. Why? They're actually pretty funny in pub games. The only problem I found from console to PC is people were less social. When Halo was popular, people would just join random friends games or start custom games together. Everyone seems to be doing their own thing on PC. Maybe I just have bad friends. PCMR Arizona State Bro Hundreds of them. Same lol
It's a big fancy interface. Perfect for Netflix and streaming and whatnot.  Don't get me wrong - I haven't owned a console in years and I only play games on PC.  But there's no sense in pretending you can build a capable system for $200. No, you fucking cant. Im replying to this tomorrow with a full newegg list.

If im wrong I will gild this fucker.

The PC has to : 
*Play the games at minimum of 30FPS avg.
*It has to be a ready ecosystem (Meaning it has input devices, and an OS)

Edit: yeah, pirating the OS kinda undermines the whole purpose of said comparison. Ive bought a windows key from G2A for superlow 20€ at one time which isnt even close to new prices, and Id question the legality of said key.

Like said, I will do one tomorrow on PC since iPads too clumsy for the million tabs needed.  Is that cheaper than a refurbished xbone? Exactly, I don't think people realize just how underpowered the ps4 is, it was obsolete on launch. Cheaper than a refurbished Xbox? You're talking $200 at that point. Windows alone is going to set you back $100. You're not building a full PC, that outperforms an Xbox one for $100.  You can build a gaming PC, with peripherals and display, for $199? They don't HAVE TO but they do  Consoles are the sole reason gaming is where it is today.  Only the most low end PC games actually gain a player base comparable to console games.  If you are genuinely upset about it, then you drastically overestimate the amount of high end PC owners out there. Jesus christ you're a moron. (For the record, I wish cross-play was a thing)
But ,no, it isn't our jobs. 

There's no sacred written pact to provide a "nice to have feature". Developers are not bound by some legal or moral code to provide something, even if the majority of fans want something.  

No doubt Sony has done cost/benefit analysis and determined that it's simply not worth the extra work to make it happen. These are big companies, not your friends. They aren't going to undertake an expensive, time consuming, and ultimately unvaluable task just because you want it. 

I don't want to sound too cynical, but that's how it is. Any cut feature, any lost content, is simply because of that.

 Portal 2 also, via Steam Yes. See my edit to the original post Even FF11 was on ps2 and PC. Maybe, but just because someone does something nice for you, they don't own you. "I am not the enemy you are looking for."

"You are not the enemy I am looking for." LOL he's like oh ok my bad https://i.imgur.com/FglOKz1.gifv Why is the pause menu so broken in this game? Love the panic knife lol This must've probably happened in almost every war. Not everybody likes to die and not everybody wants to kill. Leaders have conflicts but soldiers have to suffer through it. Can someone explain why this is a thing?

It's hilarious, but I just want to know. r/gamersbeingbros Tank was probably Canadian  The more I see these, the less I believe they aren't setup.  Tank can tell you've had a rough day. https://gfycat.com/ShockedIllinformedBug Omfg only has this happened to me like once before. Playing cod and the other dude walked up on me prone sniping. I waited for it, but he didnt shoot. 

We both stared and then jumped around and then he layed prone and pulled out a sniper. I layed down and we sniped for about 2 minutes before his teammate came for him and killed me on sight.

 I wonder if he yelled like I did **NNOOOO!!** No hang on, lets talk about how OP has like 3 posts in the first 4 pages of reddit, dude is on a roll.  I love this trend.  This happened to me last night, except I was in the tank. I also ran him over. I may be a dick, results are still pending.  What game is this? BF1? The tank was like "roger that" I found that surprisingly funny. How in gods name do you remember your username? "Just came over to check up on you. You need anything? Snacks? Drinks? Condoms? I'll be over this hill if you need me!" "Whoah Jeff, give me a little more time to invert my settings man."

"Oh ok. I'll shoot you later bro."

*Drives off* What do we say to tanks?

Not today. Am I the only one who sees this as a transaction at this point?

"Fine.  I'll let you live and leave easy points on the table, BUT I BETTER SEE THIS ON REDDIT/IMGUR LATER TONIGHT!"
 What is going on here? I keep seeing these posts with a head shake followed by a tank airing mercy. Are... Are players actually becoming *decent people??* this is actually adorable.... that 'no' on the tank got me This is like if Pixar made a WW movie.

The tank wanted a friend but it's shy and your gun scared it off. :( I bet that guy did Nazi see that tank coming! Staged  TANK: WOOO TIME TO KILL

guy: pls no kill

TANK: ... no kill *reverse* The second peak over the hilltop really got me. Then I realized it was a 15 sec gif :[ I'm crying. This is my new favourite video of all time. lmaooooo It's so nice seeing people not taking advantage of others online like always It's like having a dance off in League of Legends. Sometimes you dance and they dance. Sometimes Blitz pulls you under his tower and his team devours you. Few videos out that gone viral like this. 

Is there a mass majority of Canadians playing battle field one? These are all so obviously staged. Tank you The entire plot of Furry.  I love how this has become a thing among redditors.  I die laughing every time I see something like this. I don't play shooters often but this makes me want to.  British Pvt. Henry Tandey spares future leader of the Nazi Party, Adolf Hitler circa 1918 (colorized) People are now staging this Can someone explain to me why I find these mutual exchanges of left right left right so knee slappingly hilarious?   So these are staged right? Looks a bit staged with how long they linger in the pause menu There should be a sub dedicated to these. Tonight. You. gamers who act like that, where are you? i must be with my kind! Staged comedy is so funny! I can't see these and not think about the Iron Giant. https://youtu.be/UuCz3sGsim8?t=18s Tank God understands your plead and grants you a second opportunity at life. I've only heard legends of this happening, but to see a video of it is undeniably remarkable. TIL that WWI was pretty damn adorable. That tanks in this game are freaking hilarious.  Hang on... all I have to do to keep from getting killed in BF is shake my head?! I don't understand how people have these type of encounters. A tank glances at me and I'm blown to bits lol. I love it. the tank looks like it's shaking metaphorical head  like "ugh, bitch, I'm outta here" Every time I try this they kill me :( Pretty nice looking grass you got ther. This is the best thing I've ever seen in my life. This has just become tank meta I'd like to believe this is truly two strangers having an understanding. Seriously so..... cute......
 At some point you have to wonder whether or not this was staged, given the previous events where the same happened and how long it has been since they were first posted. Plenty of time to make your own version and reap the karma I mean me too thanks. I'm glad that this is a thing. Sometimes shit happens & u gotta do some adjustments in settings....or you had to take a quick piss. Basically mrw I see any tank friend or foe in hardcore...
 i see a trend here Kappa
 Would've been funnier if they were like no. yes. no. yes. BOOM.

[or no, yes, yes, no, wait! BOOM](https://i.imgur.com/vmDC9DD.gif) Only the Reddit community would be able to make this a thing.  I love this shit every time! Very few things on the internet make me laugh anymore but this made me laugh out loud. Why did you linger without hitting the Options button before he appeared? There seems to be a lot of polite chaps in this game.

Then again, it's suppose to simulate WW1 where the Christmas truce did happen. Such gentlemen.  Stuff like this has to be staged like come on, like someone is actually cool enough to no just blow him up Same thing happened to Hitler in WW1 Sometimes it's good to know when you're whipped before you start a fight.   "Hey you need anything?"

"I'm good"

"Oh ok...

Hey you sure?"

Bad wingman /r/bettereveryloop For some reason this reminded me of family guy, so I added some audio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwAHMhdGZiY  These will always be my favorite videos. http://i.imgur.com/TeI03gL.gifv Anyone else remember the Counter-Strike GO post like this a few months back? There is hope in this world
 Meanwhile on the canadian servers.... What game is this? /u/jvroom What's even funnier is when people try doing this because they've seen it on the internet and then they get killed. 

Like bitch this ain't Reddit my goal is to win  Are these occurring during original gameplay or set up? How do you tell  This just gave me respect for these style fps players. I'd lost that years ago. Thank you. Why is this a thing? this is staged af

op (/u/-___-___-__-___-___-) plz dont post fake shit thx     fake *Homer Simpson groan* "see you later" Soldier: No R2D2! You will blow our cover.

*Tank nods head and rolls off* this is my favorite thing to happen in multiplayer shooter games. this is like the 4th reiteration of the same type of circumstance, and I'm ready for more.  Going to call fake as why would he wait with the cursor on the Options menu for so long like that until the tank came into view.... these used to be so funny now we have kids faking so hard for that karma...  I loooove this.  I guess you could say "Tanks a lot"

I'm sure this pun has been made 1000 times already We all know a heavy tank won't do that ... I hate that evil toaster  My heart tells me this should be in a /r/awww .... Such a cyoot tank. I miss gaming like this. Brings me back.  r/gamersbeingbros Typical 2016 gamer, ready to quit as soon as the game isn't going their way. How disgraceful. I forget which game, but there was a shooter I played that whenever someone was in the game-settings they would get a specific symbol over their head to show other players.
This didn't mean they couldn't get killed, but respectful players would know. Anecdote time!

My Grandfather was Wehrmacht in WW2. Initially in the eastern front, he was transferred west just in time for Normandy and thought he had  finally gotten a lucky break. But noooo, just when things go from shit-situation to full blown clownfuck lunacy in the east, he gets put back. 


So he crawls through this trench during a Soviet assault and suddenly sees himself face to face with a red army man crawling towards him. 


They look at each other for a moment and then both crawl back to where they came from.

Kind of an "I've had enough of this crap" moment for both of them I guess.  'in menu' kills are my favorite.


i give no mercy and expect no mercy lol What I don't get is why he just keeps coming back over and over honestly stop toying with him  Is this nodding "No" with tank turrets a thing? I have seen a few examples of this, but I don't play BF1 and I feel a bit out of the loop. now that what you call an in game menu I just feel like this stuff is staged at this point. how do you run into such nice people, this would never happen to me That's a set up, why wait on the options tab and not click it?  Staged and fake.  how many of these are staged now? I don't get it... This was funny the first few times, but how is this shit at the top of this sub still?  "No indeed" Love it! I love these gifs. fake and gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay Common courtesy, look how bad his team was losing by...  I'm getting a feeling this was set up I guess this is a meme now. As fake as a strippers titties. Oh look it's the same gif we saw a few weeks ago except this is less funny and more obviously set up  People still upvote these staged encounters? Interesting. This is the third or so BF1 gif of this type I've seen and they still make me laugh my ass off. OMG this is SO funny!!!!!!111!!!1! What are the ODDS?!  I imagine this is how Canadians avoid violence. "Not today eh?" All ghillied up Why does this happen so often!? Any time i try this I end up halfway across the map glitched into a wall. Just got the game today. This will probably be me in a few hours as I'm adjusting settings.  r/GamersBeingBros  In WWI the soldiers really did have empathy from all the loved ones that they themselves had lost in the war. What is this, tf2? this is the definition of mercy Its like  he walked in on you fapping This is adorable  It's like a modern All Quiet on the Western Front.  A mini Christmas in July Truce. The tank has shown mercy! Worship him you puny mortals! this is awesome and i love seeing gifs like this, but i would have had to explode you. snipers generally bug the absolute shit out of me. i don't know how YOU play, but most snipers i see care absolutely nothing for helping the team or playing the objective and it nearly ruins my fun. >_< i was in a squad earlier and 3 of the other 4 people were snipers who did nothing but hide and shoot people. they got maybe 10 kills between them the whole game and zero flag captures. UGH PLAY THE FUCKING OBJECTIVE. Just bought this game for $40 instead of battlefield 4 for only $10, hope I made the right decision! This has never happened to me. I guess I just get paired with the sadists "You don't want to kill me."

"I don't want to kill you."

"You want to go back to Britain and rethink your life."

"I want to go back to Britain and rethink my life." "Tanks alot for not killing me." Player: Pls nu
Tank: k fam
 Millennials... Sheesh... Back in my day we knifed each other to death. "Tell him, Peter"

"Apparently everyone gets one"

"~~Yeah thats right~~ Bingo" Hahaha and how it just BACKS UP Seen this before but I'm in tears lol  https://fat.gfycat.com/WarmBountifulGoa.webm "no"

"Oh yeah im gonna fuck you up"

"....no dude"

Is how i imagined that if it was a conversation.  This has a disturbing lack of pixels. [deleted] https://gfycat.com/WarmBountifulGoa https://gfycat.com/ShockedIllinformedBug Recorded via microwave Haha I love it dude Ahhh the infamous potato gif from last week.  I've never played it, but reddit has basically taught me that a dude in a tank will never kill you if you ask him nicely not to in BF1 I don't think anyone here can answer your question. I wondered if his weapon switch was due to the same shit that makes me have to switch weapons after being revived, else I cant fire... Took about 3 deaths before I figured that shit out. Edit: (Supposedly) The menu is hosted entirely on the server-side, and is prioritized under the gameplay, so that's why it takes so long to pull up. The whole menu system is broken for me man. Main menu,  pause menu and all And why doesn't the quit button work? I'm not following... Legend tells of a man who once knew the secret of this great mystery. He died of 'natural causes'. Since when does getting stabbed 37 times in the neck constitute 'natural causes'? 

Somebody's got some explaining to do.   ALWAYS panic knife when in doubt. Could just save your life Panic knife has actually pulled out a few ridiculously lucky kills for me. Also probably made some people wildly mad that the guy they got 4 shots on spun around and put a trench knife in their neck. 

Sorry lads. panic knife happens to me so much. it's rough not being very good but having too much fun to slink away in shame. thank god i can be a medic and still contribute. i'm getting better but... That's not a panic knife. The melee button is the same but as closing the menu. Even if you press the button once you melee as soon as you leave the menu.  I mean, csgo reflexes talking here, anytime a soldier gets scared they should start switching their weapons quickly.  It's the most logical approach. /s To my understanding that mercy went out of the window the second the enemy saw a scope on your gun. I remember reading that USSR had problems in WWII with soldiers missing on purpose.

Edit, found the source:

https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dvsb1/iama_94_year_old_wwii_veteran_who_was_conscripted/cjtm9ei/?context=3&st=iw2ztjme&sh=7c6d6013 Kinda like the ending of Fury when that german soldier peeks under the tank and sees Norman laying there. It was a very human moment.  If you'd like a mind blowing read, check out On Killing, a psychological breakdown on killing in war. Short story? You're right. I think the game did a good job of showing this in one of the cinematic cutscenes. 

Fast forward to about 11:15

https://youtu.be/Id4Ez8xfp7M [Here's a very good video on the topic by Lindybeige.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zViyZGmBhvs) honor, chivalry, yada yada [deleted] Because it's set up.

2 players are in a skype call together, and they join different teams. They both meet in an empty part of the map with no players around and act out this shit.

There are so many signs of this happening, mainly why an enemy tank would go to the world border (look at the minimap).

Then we look at the player going through the menu, it's so slow and clunky, and that's not lag. Notice how he doesn't actually go into the options menu, and has the tank perfectly in frame?, yeah. No.

and finally, those tanks are fucking loud, hence why it's a gif form.

Sorry to be a /u/xxi_killjoy_ixx , but c'mon. Because it gets jerked off super hard when you post the gif on Reddit. These are all set up. I'm not saying I have a problem with that, I'm just answering your question as to "why this is a thing." https://i.imgur.com/FglOKz1.gifv

This was on the front page a couple weeks ago Because someone posted it once. Everyone found it funny
 Now everyone has to do it. I did not know this was a thing. Thank you! Making sure this was here before I linked it again.  I've always wanted to be Candian One day, Canada will rule the world, and then we'll all be sorry. Idk, I was spared once while I was afk. I'll be that guy too. I do crap like this all the time when I'm bored, be I

Edit: well, this is embarrassing. > The more I see these, the less I believe they aren't setup.

I had to read this as: The more I see these, the MORE I believe they ARE setup.

Thats the same thing right? You can tell this one is fake by seeing how much time he spends on "option" before doing anything. It's as if he's waiting for it. 

Anyone who plays these games knows that when you pause, you better know exactly which buttons to press to change your controller configs or loadout and move quickly and swiftly with a purpose.  I know, holy shit

:D Nah let's talk about how fifty thousand people have posted the link to the same 3-4 GIFs in response I think we need a sub for this.  Crash Bandicoot. Yes I also would like to know. It's the size and cuteness of the tank and how it awkwardly and stiffly rolls further into the cuddlefield. 3 Underscores, 3 Underscores, 2 Underscores, 3 Underscores, 3 Underscores.

Basically, it's perfectly symmetrical and is just at the limit of Reddit's allowed username length, so if I fucked it up, I wouldn't be able to complete the last -___- while logging in, which helps a lot. Uh yeah I'm going to go into the menu.. oh I forgot what I was using the menu for.
 Given my experience with gaming, I'm gonna have to say that this was clearly set up between two friends. If the sniper was me, I'd have been smooshed between tank treads like so much grape jelly! battlefield 1 The OP is TEAMPROMOS on Imgur, and he guarantees that this shit isn't fake, so message him if you don't believe me. He heard the tank coming and hesitated to click on it  Honestly the pause menu in this game is pretty delayed and even if you try to escape it takes a few seconds sometimes.. Knowing it was Daniel Craig, rethinking his life is just basically re-realizing you're married to Rachel Weisz and you're life is fucking mint.. One of the best lines in the Prequels. >"You want to go back to Britain and rethink your life."

Not the best thing to say to a French tank.  Worked out in this guys favor though. I'd rather sell you death sticks.  Tanks for not killing me I'll just roll along. What would some from 20 years ago think if they read your comment? At least you had knives. All we had were sticks n' stones. Tanks for the memories. > BINGO

FTFY [Oh boy you're going to like this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamersbeingbros), which I'm pretty sure was made because of the Gif you replied to.  I actually can't understand these videos. Are they signalling something specific to each other, or just messing around. I like how he wasn't sure if his small movements were clear communication so he progressively made them bigger and bigger until they were ridiculous. Looks like one of those awful "To be continued" memes by the end gotta add speaker name to this dialogue:

> MMA fighter: "no"

> Toddler: "Oh yeah im gonna fuck you up"

> MMA fighter: "....no dude" Oh i almost thought you were just having a random conversation with yourself  that had nothing to do with the gif you commented underneath It's for better WW1 realism. It's only recently we got high res.  It's the PS2 version of the game. I don't understand why, there's a high quality version but everyone is posting this one. If you have the pickaxe equipped as your melee weapon it can damage most vehicles. It doesn't do much damage but if the driver is oblivious you can be a real pain in his ass. Some melee weapons can damage vehicles. The actual damage will be minuscule against a tank, but any damage will stop a tank from self repairing so it can be useful for that. http://i.imgur.com/DqJWQlm.gifv I don't know exactly why I have you tagged as goat fucker, but I think it's because I saw someone else had you tagged as goat fucker. I love how he gets more frantic and frantic in shaking his head Why am I feeling sorry for a game character? I laughed tho. People in light tanks, Heavy tanks don't give a fuck.  Please provide additional logs  Im sorry, but my responses are limited.


You must ask the right questions.  Doesn't look like anything to me. "Where is JA?!!" Never happened to mr, have a bunch of kills by being revived and my killer goes after the medic and I vlow him away while prone. oh no way. Would make sense. Source? So basically like Destiny on the 360? Yeah, the whole interface is a laggy, glitchy shit show. Especially when you want to change your loadout. According to what I've heard it's because the game loads the next map during the end-of-round screen and the engine doesn't like to stop loading a map before its finished.

I keep getting freezes on the end-of-round screen so its frustrating for me too. My biggest gripe with this game is that quit takes 3 minutes. I just Alt-f4 now.  It works for me it just takes 10 minutes! On PS4 at least, it's faster to close the whole game and reopen it than it is to actually "quit" (/load next map) Haha yea I suck too, but I feel like I'm making it rain in da club tossing those medical pouches out to everyone  This sounds like a marvelous game Yeah, snipers are devastating in wars. Takes a special kind of man to shoot someone posing no threat to them That was the US, not the USSR (and it's a somewhat questionable claim).

The USSR was being invaded and genocided by Germany. Soviet soldiers weren't just fighting for their leader's agenda, they were fighting to avoid certain massacre of themselves, their families, and their entire race. They weren't doing any intentional missing. My 9th grade history teacher told us a story of a trench battle between the French and the Germans in WWI. They had a ceasefire for Christmas and saw each other's festivities underway. I don't remember who started it, but one invited the other over, and they celebrated together. 

Afterwards both sides had to be moved elsewhere because they refused to fight each other.

Might be total bull. Would love for someone to fact check it. But awesome story nonetheless.

Edit: As it turns out, pretty famous event. I guess I'm just out of the loop. :/ Wasn't only the USSR but all parties in war. I once read that the majority of American soldiers would miss their shots and that around 10 % of the soldiers were responsible for most of the kills. 

>Studies of combat activity during the Napoleonic and Civil Wars revealed stirking statistics. Given the ability of the men, their proximity to the enemy, and the capacity of their weapons, the number of enemy soldiers hit should have been well over 50 percent, resulting in a killing rate of hundreds per minute. Instead, however, the hit rate was only one o two per minute. And a similar phenomenon occured during World War I: according to british Lieutenant George Roupell, the only way he could get his men to stop firing into the air was by drawing his sword, walking down the trench, "beating [them] on the backside and ... telling them to fire low".1 World War II fire rates were also remarkably low: historian and US Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall rerported that, during battle, the firing rate was a mere 15 to 20 percent; in other words, out of every hundred men engaged in a firefight, only fifteen to twenty actually used their weapons. And in Vietnam, for every enemy soldiers killed, more than fifty thousand bullets were fired.2

Source: http://www.historynet.com/men-against-fire-how-many-soldiers-actually-fired-their-weapons-at-the-enemy-during-the-vietnam-war.htm Well he is from Azerbaijan.

I am pretty convinced that soldiers who actually fled the occupation zone/partisans/ones that had significant ones die in the occupation didn't have problem with shooting the enemy.

Especially once they started to push forward.

 The whole; "this is a highly unfair moment" kind of thing? I love it when people join a knife fight and actually stick to it. I have lots of funny CS:Source memories of 1v1 knife fights. You've made a pretty solid argument, and I agree with it. But sometimes shit like this does happen in the wild.

Once on Destiny I was playing a Mayhem (quick supers and lots of heavy drops) when I ran into a guardian who immediately popped a bubble shield. "Wow," I thought to myself, "this guy's running a void Titan in Mayhem, he must not like kills..." (that's probably the weakest subclass in that game type). They suddenly pulled out a sword and started blocking. "Ohhhh, this guy wants to swordfight, ehhh???" I pulled mine out and we had ourselves a dual.

Granted, it's pretty much the only option I had, but it was still funny. I sent them a message and ended up running a raid with him. Definitely set up. A similar gif was posted like last month

Most dudes in a tank will kill you. Theres no mercy in battlefield  I'm usually devil's advocate for submissions like this but I mean come on, I guess you're a normie if you've never had an interaction like this online. You can't say they are all set up. I am sure some are, but people actually do these things in gameplay. I do things like this, especially when I'm bored of the gameplay, because it can be funny.

I used to try to drive enemies around in a warthog in Halo and let them gun down my teammates because it made me laugh. Also, I could see all my teammates on the map so it was easy money for them. I never have posted a gif of anything in my entire life.  The first one was amusing, but now it's just boring. What do you mean set up? Like both the folk are in on it?

Yeah, no this shit definitely happens in some games.  I bet your life is just the worst. You're welcome :D gamers gotta be bros! Happened just recently! It was a BF1 gif, I believe. It's pretty much brand new, I think it started like two weeks ago growing fast though. I personally upvote everything so more people post there ;) Have you tried[ **Look And Feel Canadian Breath Spray**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wtf_amazon/comments/5ff41j/look_and_feel_canadian_breath_spray_659/) Who hasn't?  Drop one more letter and you can be Cadian! Die for the Emperor or die trying. how would you know you were spared if you were afk.

^*schrodingers-meme* You are correct.  My Monday brain likes to make things more difficult then they need to be. /r/gamersbeingbros /r/warfarebuddies Yes All the WW1 tanks have that weird cutesy look to them, Tiers 1-3 in World of Tanks feels like you're driving a radio-controlled car. OP's got it all thought out. XD  Through repetition can you now type it goofy fast? You log *out*?! oops lemme sit at options until the tank shows up Yup. Those things are noisy.  Unfortunately Wunderbar's quote was the deathstick dealer from the prequels Me too tanks


EDIT: Obligatory joke about people thanking for gold TANKSGIVING WAS DELICIOUS tx u tread the best 'oh hey cool they made new slang' I think it would be decipherable You had a stick? 

We had to roll our stones to the fight and back. Uphill both ways.  and we had to share the rock. And Ataris  And we LIKED it! Oh, yes, I remember the days when sticks and stones would break your bones but words wouldn't hurt you. Now words are the greatest threat to humanity, or so you would think if you visited any millennial gathering. Can't say certain words because it offends them but they can wear t-shirts with the word **FUCK** on it in a family restaurant because it's freedom of speech. 

Can't we just hit each other with sticks and stones again? Life was so much simpler back then.  Dude thanks for this!! I always try to be the bro and interact with the enemy in a positive way. I expect to see that bro-move displayed in CSGO (de_Mirage) in there.

EDIT: I now /u/rooonaldooo99 is now tagged as "Goat-Fucker". I expect an answer, Roonaldooo! When I get an answer I will de-tag you as a goat-fucker! I think he makes his movements bigger because he's not sure if they're understandable or not.  Your question has been closed because too little information was provided and the question was unclear Btw, what game is this? Looks so cool.  That detective... is the right question. Damn it. Bringing back 2004.  It's happened to me every time ive been revived. If I don't swap weapons, I cant fire. Sometimes the gun will even be held in a weird centered position on the screen. It seems to be intermittent. I want to say around 1 of every 4 revives I get the bug. I don't try to shoot anyone while prone generally. I'll get revived, get up, and my gun will be broken in some way (either I can't ADS, I can't shoot, it's stuck in ADS, or some other weird thing) and I have to switch weapons and switch back to use my gun properly. Honestly, I don't remember, there was a thing where a guy did some testing, I don't know if it was officially confirmed, but the guy did some tests that made it pretty clear. I changed my post to show how certain I'm not, haha > Source

No this is Frostbite 3. Source is a different engine. I only played the Beta, and I assumed / hoped that those issues were (understandably) just in that stage of the game. It pains me to find out that that wasn't the case.  How does the engine like me forcing the game to exit while it is loading the next map cause it won't just quit like I asked it to? Huh! Huh engine! How do you like that!? The fact the bug has 100% repro steps doesn't make it better.  This needs to get fixed asap. Same on PS4, PS Button + Close Application, reload game. Way faster It is, in all seriousness. [deleted] The claim of aiming high is more often attributed to US soldiers in Vietnam, which make sense looking at the fact America spent like thousands of rounds per Viet killed. And since the draft took a bunch of people who didn't want to fight to start with. Stalin ordered that those who retreat or attempt to flee from combat be shot to death.   I also don't think intentional missing was going on for soviet soldiers.  The parent comment is full of shit.
 Stalin gave you no choice. If you did not fight you were a traitor. You died. 27 million soviets died in that war. The U.S. lost 500 thousand. In the first world war, the Austrian empire had a massive desertion/surrender/ shooting over heads problem. Many slavs did not want to be in the Hapsburg empire and refused to shoot at their coethnic russians You mean the Christmas truce? Pretty famous event  Sounds very similar to the English and the Germans, once Christmas they heard each other singing Christmas songs and so sang together. One soldier then took up a foot ball and one by one they came together and had a game on Christmas.


Although in this incident the fighting did continue the next day.. It definitely happened in several areas on the Western front in 1914. In a much more limited fashion in 1915. And then not again for the rest of the war.

>The Germans placed candles on their trenches and on Christmas trees, then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The artillery in the region fell silent. The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year's Day in others.[6] This is somewhat true and definitely a movie

Edit: Movie is a french film "Joyeaux Noël" if you are curious I have heard this as well; seems to be a common story of WW1 > Might be total bull.

It's called the Christmas Truce. It's 100% true and [pretty well known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce

http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/christmas-truce-of-1914

Didn't have time to read all the wiki, but a quick skim talks about unofficial ceasefires during the 1914 Christmas. Following years were a lot less successful due to threats by commanding officers.

Not so sure about moving elsewhere though. [Time](http://time.com/3643889/christmas-truce-1914/) says

> And of course, it was only ever a truce, not peace. Hostilities returned, in some places later that day and in others not until after New Year’s Day. “I remember the silence, the eerie sound of silence,” one veteran from the Fifth Batallion the Black Watch, Alfred Anderson, later recalled to The Observer. “It was a short peace in a terrible war.” As the Great War resumed, it wreaked such destruction and devastation that soldiers became hardened to the brutality of the war. While there were occasional moments of peace throughout the rest of World War I, they never again came on the scale of the Christmas truce in 1914.

Still, it's a nice thought to have. Heck, maybe it did happen. Sure that this is the right link? I can't find the quote...
 Yeah, in WW2, the majority of soldiers didn't use their weapons. By Korea, most were willing to shoot but not to kill (i.e. they weren't aiming their shots). And by Vietnam, the number of bullets lost in "shoot to kill" attempts had gone up immensely (whether the bullets actually hit/wounded/killed anyone is another thing altogether, but it's very interesting to see how the soldiers' perception of the purpose of their guns had/has changed through history).

There's an anecdote floating around that in WW2 a US and a Nazi patrol caught each other off guard, so they laid down their guns and started throwing rocks and shouting insults at each other. I know right. It just seems so out of place in an online shooter.  So he didn't blow him up because that guy was severely out gunned?  Oh, no doubt. When I get bored, I'll let enemy infantry jump on my tank and try to sneak them into our backfield. If I accidentally run them over in the process, I usually fire off a quick salute, then gas myself over their corpse. When it's an entire squad, things fall apart pretty fast, though. I know they'll take the tank if I get out, so I just try pantomime regret.  But that generally doesn't work, so I just end up killing the rest as whimsically as possible and looking like a troll.  I played a character dressed as a juggalo in gta online. Purple shoes, shirtless, stupid tattoos, track pants, facepaint, curly shaggy hair. I was level 80 maybe and found a level 200 guy dressed identical to me head to toe. He was wrecking everyone and stopped when I ran up. I messaged him "BROTHER!" and he jumped in his car and beeped for me to hop in. We played together for like 2 hours driving around fucking people up. He helped my k/d go way up.  yeah once in league of legends i was in toplane and everytime i attacked the enemy he started recalling. So i was kind of amused and just didnt attack him anymore and after he tried to attack me i just hit the recall button. And we just farmed and recall/cancel whole game. We didnt even attack when the jungler came. Pretty stupid actually but sometimes there is just this funny interaction between players. It makes absolutly no sense game wise but the main goal of the game is to really have fun and thats what we had. Yeah I'd shoot that guy without a thought. In real battlefield the guy in the gif would have died 10,000 times I tried to make peace many times but enemy just don't believe me and start to shot. If I saw infantry guy sitting like this, he is probably taking flag or snipping. Both are on my list to go :D so it's rare occasions I would leave infantry guy alive but then they just start to shot rpg or try to run away what wakes up my cat's instinct to catch its pray :P Two teams one warthog is classic. Its happened to me several times. I feel a moment of bonding with the guy on the other team when it happens. I even said I don't have a problem with it. I laughed at this gif.  Lol wtf.

Last time someone said that to me, I conked them with a dictionary. It was an unabridged dictionary at that. 

For the millennials out there, a dictionary is a large, heavy tome full of words with information about those words in them, such as pronunciation, definition, what role the word plays in a sentence, similar words etc. The unabridged dictionaries had all the words in it, including vulgar and slang.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_Xdi4T8mgI [deleted] > America spent like thousands of rounds per Viet killed.

To be fair, that stat is *highly* misleading, because it counts rounds fired in training and exercises, not just those fired in actual combat (I forget the ratio, but I think it's something on the order of 10:1 training rounds vs combat; some very skewed ratio, at any rate). Aside from that, most rounds fired in combat are suppressive fire, meant to force the enemy to take cover and limit their movement, with little or no expectation of individual rounds will actually hit a target.

That said, given the morally questionable nature of the war combined with no threat of massacre and annihilation, I have no doubt whatsoever that US soldiers in Vietnam were not exhibiting the same fanatical drive to effectively kill that Soviet soldiers on the Eastern Front were. Well, I'm sure that the inaccuracy of troops with the early M16 also played a role. Back then, our riflemen still used full auto most of the time as opposed to the aimed, semi automatic fire of today. That's the point. Though while Stalin did give that order, it was really a moot point. In reality, it was the Germans who gave Soviet soldiers no choice but to fight or die. Wasn't that when the Red Baron spared Snoopy? That's so surreal. One minute you're finally enjoying yourselves with the enemies and the next you go right back to trying to kill them again  I really like the idea of wars that are fought with civility. Like back when medics were often kinda left alone to treat the wounded despite being an easy shot themselves. Now the strategy is to wound to aim at medics I think I have that movie on my Hitler wall. Try changing "stirking" to "striking"  and try again /s The Battlefield fan base is changing the mold for shooters, hopefully for the better. This shit never happens to me.

I try it on community servers in CSGO, and usually on headshot-only server. It's an interesting way to bring out some personalities in the game.

It sometimes takes a bit longer to get a kill on HS-only server (head is a smaller target obv.), so I find myself "strafe-dancing" in front of my opponent for far too long (especially with deagle).

[*WHAT DID YOU SEE?!*](https://xkcd.com/979/) PC. Could be the difference there, we may be on to something.... Jesus how old am I.  I did not know that about the rounds fired thing, but regardless I completely agree and my point was absolutely backing you up in saying that I've never heard that assigned to the USSR, but always US in Veitnam which as I've said makes way more sense.

I actually just looked it up, apparently it's a hotly debated topic, I'm inclined to feel it would still apply to a subset of draftees however. Some however had an indeed insatiable blood lust, that was cultivated by command. Tiger force was essentially a CIA expiriment on creating devastating soldiers. These were the guys Apocalypse Now was based on. There is a book called Tiger Force that is really incredible. Its an expansion on a series that won a Pulitzer for uncovering some of this. So called "hyper alpha males" were tossed into the jungle, given meth amd sent into 'battle' against women children and farmers (thats the ultra tldr)

Anyway, I found it fascinating and terrifying, highly recommend the book, or 15 minutes on wikipedia or whatever. Work is work right?  It took a bit of 'nudging' from higher up to get things started again. Shooting medics is a war crime. Definitely not policy in the armed forces of any civilised country. Do i want to know what a Hitler wall is Yeah playing battlefield 1 drunk as fuck leading my team on bayonet charges is awesome, everyone always has a laugh > ~~The~~ Battlefield ...~~fan base~~ is changing the mold for shooters

>-DrionSteel

This will show up in one of their promos.

 I think they've definitely helped change the mold as far as game play and mechanics, but I'm a little hesitant to say that the games are changing player interaction (at least.... not on a crazily different than other similar games are).  ez So the only interaction that I see when playing the game (besides shooting each other) is calling each other cheaters, complaining about overpowered shotguns, pistols, knives and snipers... and then the complains about paper tanks, laggy planes... stupid teams... fucked up matchmaking... it is COD all over again. Are we playing the same games? The BF player base is just as toxic as every other PVP game. I consider myself lucky when I join a game and the worst thing happening is just players ignoring the objective and camping with sniper rifles to improve their KDR. Its usually rife with team killing, trolling, and nobody playing their roles.

Despite the academic debate on the validity of the statistics, I completely agree. I probably would have been first in line for the draft if it had been reinstated for the Iraq War, and I guaran-fucking-tee you I'd have been doing some missing on purpose if that had happened (assuming my life wasn't in danger, of course). [It's my wall with Hitler's face on it.](http://imgur.com/OVz7mZQ) Seems pretty close to WW1 to me reminds me of Halo: CE days..  8 vs 8 all rocket launchers or sniper rifles lol.  In da bloodgulchhh i dont get this

battlefield 1 plays just like the battlefields before it

its just the first one set in ww1 so it plays different enough to feel like a unique game (which is good)

its still battlefield at its core tho (getting sniped from far away due to extremely open maps, engineers sitting in tanks far away from combat hoping out w/ no animation time to repair before the enemies can reload their rockets, laggy interactions with dog tag thieves)

the setting is different and they brought back levels of destruction not seen since bad company 2 (and new physics engines help make that cooler, like how individual plane parts get shot off)

internet just has a boner for anything that takes sales away from cod it seems... It's crazy how important being on a good squad is. I just got the game and have had some amazing moments already but then the next game every squad is either locked or full and I get stuck with the people who don't give a shit and I just keep spawning in the middle of nowhere and once I get near something I have no backup and get killed.

[deleted] Cyka blyat  That's his rippling head muscles I just spent a really long time watching them wiggle.  Thanks. Yeah, even if it still didn't help me, at least I tried something that helped another person in 2004, so I can dismiss that particular issue. People like you make my day. You guys are probably running the game at an inconsistent framerate causing these errors. Possibly too high if you have a beast machine. . . Or the game could be coded poorly for pc. Probably that. Oh, sweet. I was worried for a second  Only as long as they say fuck a lot.  This is pretty much exactly the response I expected, and now I feel dumb that I didn't explain before the initial post. I agree with you. I don't think each subsequent Battlefield game is completely changing FPS gameplay and dynamics. I guess my experience comes from which games I've played, and in which sequence. I've played all the COD games from Finest Hour, to Ghosts. The first Battlefield game I played was 2, and then I recently played 1. I guess what I mean from my statement, is that with a much smaller library of games, the Battlefield series seems to have changed much more than something like the COD series. 

Edit- 

And that's not to say that the COD series isn't any good. The main reason I stopped purchasing new COD games is because I'm over the multiplayer. The multiplayer is pretty much the same from COD game to COD game (It may be super similar from BF to BF, but like I said, I have much more of a gap between those games). 

I truly wish that game designers would spend much more time creating campaign levels. I get so much more enjoyment out of pretending that I'm a US Marine fighting through the Philippine Islands, or a Soviet pushing into the home of German soldiers who have killed my countrymen. I loved fighting in Misfit 1-3, feeling like I was an actual part of a squad. I would run ahead and try to divert as much fire to me as possible because I was invested in the story. 

I'm so much past the point of caring if I can grind enough in multiplayer to get a rainbow pattern on a rifle that no one would ever use otherwise. 

I can understand the enjoyment of those sort of deathmatch games when playing at a LAN party, but... do the new COD games even support local games?

I don't know, I don't want to seem like that guy who's all "BACK IN MY SAY THINGS WERE BETTER!"
 I have a group of 3 friends I play with, we're pretty good at ptfo, we leave our squads open so it can fill out, but we're always in a private party chat so we don't hear the squawkers. 

Even if we're on a losing team we still tend to do fairly well, when running together. The squad really does make a world of difference in this game! A six fingered man has no middle finger. Naw, that's pigeons.  I keep trying to leave, but all other news aggregators/social media platforms are FAR worse.

TIL

A No, he has two. That way he can tell people to go fuck themselves extra hard. Minded blew I have seen so many princess bride references today. It's been great Imgur is our cancer. Reddit is with the LORD now Probably. *Fallout voice*: **Reddit, reddit never changes.** Contact gaming websites like IGN or PCgamer and ask if they wanna do a story about it. They can perhaps get en contact with EA and get a good explanation That's really shitty. Weak reasoning, too.

Just btw, GOG is not based in the US at all. They're by far my preferred distributor. Do they "mark" you as undesirable at the point of purchase or when you log on to their server? Vpn? I work in regulatory compliance and am familiar with US sanction law, even before the Myanmar (aka Burma) sanctions were lifted on Oct. 7th, there was no prohibition against allowing end users to purchase or access digital content from that country. The sanction program was targeted against certain individuals and groups, as well as specific financial institutions, but not the general public. This answer from EA/Origin makes no sense, I think a CS agent is making a guess or misunderstood the company's rationale for taking this action.  I would ask CS to escalate this issue so they can provide you a more detailed response.  Dear /u/EA_Alex care to explain this? We're a really small gaming community here - probably just in the low thousands, but we're trying! Please help this become visible! They did the same to Iran, No one cared even though there was countless posts on reddit, Every single one was down voted. Here is a [post](http://answers.ea.com/t5/Origin/Origin-Unable-To-Connect-From-Iran/m-p/5554407/highlight/true#M218386) on their forums about this issue. 

EA banned every single Iranian player from accessing their purchased libraries. Sometimes you just have to hoist the black flag Wasn't there a case of Origin quietly removing certain games from people's accounts not long ago too? E.A. We take your games. I dont know if it's true or not, but we have reached into an age of gaming where the price to buy the game is actually a fee for renting.  We all dream of the day we can throw nickles at EA executives while they pan handle on the sidewalk. Have you tried using a VPN? Try this:

1. Close down Origin completely. 

2. Download a free VPN (my recommendation is Tunnelbear, it gives you 500MB free a month)

3. Use the VPN to connect to the closest country to you that still has Origin.

4. Now open Origin and launch a game.

5. When the game is fully launched, disconnect the VPN.

It sucks that you'll have to do this every time, but at least you'll be able to play your games. I think. Give it a try!

(I used this trick to play BF1 a day before release (connected to a country that already had it) and after disconnecting the VPN, the ping was good.) Tweeted it to Jim Sterling, hope he sees it.
 If EVER there was a legitimate, morally justifiable reason to pirate video games, this would be it. Seriously, fuck EA. They deserve to have their games pirated if this is the shit they think they can get away with. To hell with that "I'm not trying to advocate piracy but" nonsense. Pirate, absolutely. Pirate, pirate, pirate. Viciously ravage that company's bottom line. They stole your games, fucking steal theirs. I'm really sorry this happened to you (and your fellow countrymen). This is the danger of a global content provider like Origin/Steam; sometimes global situations necessitate iffy decisions. That said, you should definitely get a refund for things you no longer have access to.

Buy DRM-Free as often as you can. It helps mitigate this issue when it does happen.

Sucks man, good luck and I hope things work out for you! For what it's worth, Electronic Arts is a basket of Assholes.  That sucks man.  I hope you can get some traction.  Good luck. Id say you would definitely be justified in dowloading those games using other means. If you know what i mean This completely sucks, but digital distribution isn't the problem so much as DRM. Once you download a game, needing to phone home to play it is unacceptable. "the money that you pay them gives you an empty promise that the game company may let you play their game until they decide you can't. "

This is why I CANNOT STAND always-online single player games. This whole cloud-based gaming world is absolutely NOT the way to go. The gaming companies love this, because they have all the control. But gamers always always always get screwed somehow. 
Whether it's bad internet connection, or trying to play a game on a plane, or playing a game somewhere remote. It's just really stupid that you effectively paid for 'nothing' since you can't play anything unless you phone home to their mothership servers. Posted this to a Dutch news website, perhaps it might help. Such a weak reasoning. Quite frankly if this blows up, I hope it will get noticed by EA and their dumb decision reverted. I'd be really pissed if it happened to me, but thanks for warning I will be getting a PC soon and while I don't live in country that might get blocked I still will try to avoid purchasing anything off origin.  (╯°益°)╯彡┻━┻ This is outrageous  Am I the only one here who was not surprised EA are assholes ? pirate the shit out of the games Pirate the single player games and seed them to fuck to give them the middle finger.  All drm platforms are capable of this. Origin, steam, Amazon games etc.

EA isn't the only guilty party here. Steam is too. 
Don't give valve a pass. 

They can do it too.

Hence I also don't support games that need you to be online to play even single player. I boycott them like hitman and SimCity. 

Vote with your wallet and only then things will change. Else welcome to this forever  I talked about something like this happening to me years ago. Got downvoted to oblivion, people was apparently tired of hearing about how bad EA games were. Got called out for being pity and making up stories to hate on EA. 

My Origins account got mysteriously erased, all my games included. I tried to contact them a bazilion of times, one time in a chat support conversation, i gave the keys to my games as requested to the supporter. He just said "Thanks" and disconnected from the chat. 

Safe to say i have not bought a single product from EA or on origin ever since.  Hello OP. Is there a Myanmar thread or something? If so could you perhaps see if Microsoft subscription or antivirus subscriptions have been affected as well? This is why I don't like buying game from steam they don't sell you a product but a service People actually don't realize how little rights and control consumers have with digital content. Games, books, music and movies can all be restricted at a drop of a dime, even though we have purchased them. Sadly that's one thing with all the digital platforms, they say they are allowed to ban you or deny you the access to your games if they consider so
That's why I prefer and still will prefer getting my physical copy even on PC, the bad news is nowadays almost all PC games let you install with the disc but the serial is for Steam
That being said I find Steam the best in this regard, I can still download games that are no longer on their Store, even if the game can't be played anymore (I can download and play with Tungle Age of empires online, even tho the game is no longer on Steam store) but I can't download Need for speed world on Origin because is no longer supported

Yeah digital distribution sucks, sadly is the one that people are pushing.. You should try GoG at least they can't fuck you with the non-DRM I feel like this is a situation in which pirating is 100 percent justified. Unfortunately, this is kinda the point of sanctioning a country.  The idea is to get the populace enraged enough to demand change in their government.  I always thought the perfect solution would be to allow people to copy their digital content onto discs or USBs when an online service goes offline permanently. But due to concern with hacks and mods they would probably not do this but I'm sure it's possible. steam, uplay, itunes and the play store are also more than cap[able of doing this. GOG is the only one that wouldnt be able to, as when you buy and download a game, its yours, they may just ban your ability to download the game.

but thats how sanctions work. the us thinks that if they ennoy enough of the people, they will all somehow convinve their government to go back on what they said. sanctions NEVER effect a government, only its people.

we all hope this is sorted, for your sake and many otehrs in Myanmar, and that EA pull their head out their ass and realise they are a company that makesentertainment and fun for people.

interesting, as i just pulled the old credit card out of the pile of dust to purchase dragon age inquisition, afterpeople keeptelling me its actually quite good. good luck now EA. This, this my friends is why many of us do not trust solely digital distribution and maintain that we want physical media. 

The people decried as 'Tinfoil Hatters' predicted this shit years ago. And I don't mean reddit-predicted where everyone acts like something they didn't know a week ago is common knowledge. Go back to initial Xbone launch and you will see much of the ire over their intended system, but also many laughing or brushing off the idea of companies erasing content you have paid for. 

"They're not just gonna take away your games, they can't do that stop being paranoid"

And now this....with such flimsy reasoning too. 

Of all the things to circlejerk and break out pitchforks over, this one takes the cake. EA has gone too fucking far, and like DLC it'll be the norm if people let them do it. I don't give a shit about whatever reason. You can't just deny access to hundreds of dollars of content and say no refund like this. we need consumer laws to be established for digital media. This just isn't right, not at all.  This is fucking unacceptable. 

Sadly this goes for steam too I think. Steam reserves the right to take away games at any point of time since theyre essentially just loaning games. I'm probably going to get crucified for this but I don't see why a company like EA (who are notorious for making every possible penny they can) would blacklist an entire country without a valid and compelling reason. Fuck EA and it's crappy Origin. May this company fold. 

PS: As others stated, GoG is probably your best option in the future. Sorry dude.  From Myanmar too, and though I do not play games from Origin, Firaxis Games also restricts the sale of their games (XCOM 2; Civ 5). >This is a much, MUCH bigger problem than just a few gamers in Myanmar. This highlights a crucial element of the TOS of big game companies - the money that you pay them gives you essentially nothing in return, except for an empty promise that the game company may let you play their game until they decide you can't. 

Yup, digital only distribution is scary as fuck, I weep for the day when it'll be my only option. These companies have shown time and time again that they can't really handle the responsibility. This is why I still buy physical copies of games, especially new releases.  This is why I stay away from digital as much as possible. You don't actually own the game just the license to use it. Any company at any time can revoke your license for any bs reason as proven here. I recommend getting small news gaming companies involved until it gains traction and snowballs on to the big names. I'm surprised people aren't more aware of digital distributor's ability to just basically take away your account. They can do it whenever they want and you're pretty much ass to do anything about it. 

Always be careful buying online. Never know when they'll just nuke your account for <reasons>. This is why you always buy physical media. They can delete your games/films/music/kindle books any time, but they can't come into your house any physically take it away. Or, why physical is still the best option. It will always be Burma to me. Pirate the fuck out of those games.

It's a small consolation, but if anyone in the world has a moral right to pirate a company's games, you're him. I'll be honest... I'm a tad old school and since I started out with physical copies, I still prefer them... However, something like the possibility of this has always been in the back of my mind.

.


As a patient PC gamer, I actually typically wait until prices drop to 50% or lower to get a physical copy... then I often buy a steam copy at 75% off or more.  Thus having both versions for cheaper than new. Wow, I honestly thought EA was getting better. When Origin was first coming out, I specifically remember reading in their official FAQ, how they would release all of their games DRM free in the unlikely event that Origin would stop functioning. They should do this in this case. >Don't use or buy games from Origin or DRM services. - trivial_sublime

Could happen to Valve - Steam?  Does it matter if a company Like valve is based in Europe though?

Anyway OP /u/trivial_sublime has a good reason to be a pirate now. Shame I already don't respect EA, so I can't lose respect for them. This is essentially my problem with DRM and online video game services.

When you buy a game, for any reason, you can be prevented from accessing that game based on whatever random reason comes up.

This isn't just about politics, although your situation is a little bad, but with the way electronic services work.

With physical copies, you never had to deal with this, because you had your games with you, but now that so many PC games are digital, you have to buy the game through services like Steam or Origin and that means they can withhold your games for whatever reason they want if they manage to get away with it.

I love Steam and online distributions, since it makes it easier for some people to get games and the deals are incredible, but it's a notable flaw.

Luckily there are awesome sites like GoG that let you play your games DRM-free.

If you have the hard drive space, you can just download all of your games installers and back them for later use. Just like having a physical disc copy (heck, you could probably put them on discs if you wanted to).

It's why I seriously want to support GoG more and more and even awesome sites like Steam LESS. I do not like DRM, no matter how well it is handled. It is anti-gamer by its very nature. I refuse to use EA Origin, its a terrible service from a terrible company. I'm not from Myanmar and I don't use Origin but holy fuck, am I in a similar situation! This is the kind of shit that makes me want to go back to buying pirated games from our supermarkets for 1$ per DVD. Yes, it's legal and no we have no copy-right law (especially for foreign material). Blizzard already banned my country once before and people lost their accounts, luckily I don't use Battle.NET either. I didn't even want to use Steam, but Half-Life 1 and CS basically forced me to use it since it was either steam or a crack. Did I make the wrong choice with Steam? Are they gonna eventually go ahead and be like, yeah screw those little guys let's ban them and keep their money? I hope not. Or is it only a matter of time before we get fucked in the ass too???  

Also, rocket league has banned my country along with North Korea and some other ones for no fucking "*reason*". Their excuse is plain bullshit, how come other games network providers don't force them to do this? I don't know of even know ONE other game on Steam that has specifically blocked my country from multiplayer. Their developers did this out of prejudice or whatever, not their network providers, there is NO other games that did this and came up with that excuse to hide it. And what's worse is they're still selling it to us!!!  

Don't get me wrong though, it's THEIR product and THEY have EVERY right to sell it or not sell it to ANYONE they like or don't like. That's crystal clear and there's no discussion there. **If you don't want to sell to us, that's fine. But selling your shit, taking our money and THEN taking it back without giving back our money? That is by definition stealing, how the fuck do your "civilized laws" and "human rights" allow stealing from us but doesn't allow you to give us what we paid for?!** Rocket League, if you don't want to let us play your damn game, at least have the decency to lock it in our region and NOT SELL us an unplayable (multiplayer) product.  

*But can anyone even imagine how it feels to pay 60$ for a game (that in your currency is almost a quarter of month's paycheck), spend weeks downloading 50gb on a piece of shit 40 kb/s internet, and then have it taken away from you for no reason? Where the fuck is your "human rights" now or do we not count as "humans"?!*

So is the logical answer going back to buying your legally pirated disks for 1$ each in the supermarkets? Why would I still give you my money if you can gladly take back what you sold any moment you'd like and keep my money? I guess, you can have the finger EA, Blizzard, Psyonix and any other company that does/will do this. I shall torrent all your shit and seed them forever. Seroiusly, fuck you guys. According to new [DMCA](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/28/toaster_penetration_testing_green_lighted/) rules, I can pirate all your games since they're non-functioning.  

>It's unclear to me whether we can do anything for residents of other countries that are still similarly embargoed, but I'll bring the topic up for discussion internally.  

This is "nonsense" and this sucks. If a country has a stupid piece of shit government (or the other way around), why do gamers have to pay the price? I have nothing to do with mine for example. (rhetorically trying to say: life isn't fair)  

PS: I think this post has the most profanity I've ever used in my history. Thank you EA for the opportunity.^^/s EA is just a piece of shit company in general. I'm not surprised they are doing something like this. Don't buy stuff from them. (everyone else) And this is why DRM is a bad thing and should not be supported, if they didn't have DRM on this stuff the content would still be yours... Sudan here. Been under US sanctions since 1991 and got a few tricks up my sleeve to getting around these bitch ass restrictions. PM me if you need. Cheers In my opinion, an embargo preventing you from using their service should only prevent further purchases from their store. It should not prevent you accessing/using that which you've already bought and paid for. Every time I mentioned this problem with digital distribution I always got ganged up and shat on. Well shit.  If EA is complying with sanctions then as well as complaining to EA, You should also write to your local government to explain that the sanctions being imposed on your country are affecting you and they should fight to fix whatever the problem was. I don't know the political landscape in Myanmar or why it has had sanctions placed on it.

 Reason number 56,278 not to buy games on Origin.  Make sure you kick up a real stink about this. This is not on and their reply is truly weak.  That's so shit. I hope this gets resolved. I quit giving EA a dime a while ago now and I wish more people would so this shit company goes out of business.  http://imgur.com/a/jZPb6 just pirate their games I'm a little confused on this. The US sanctions against Myanmar have been in place for about 20 years. Did you use a VPN to buy the games initially or a currency exchange or 3rd party?
If so you probably contravened some subsection of the TOS.


With that being said EA (and Steam) should have better mechanisms in place for this, even if the laws predate digital distribution. Maybe they will have goodwill and provide the games again, but I suspect they have no obligation to do so.  Man this is messed up! Hope you get your games back or a refund or anything to compensate your loss What happened to you is horrible. You need to get the word out. Contact some of those sites that do gaming news. Those big companies hate it when they get bad PR. Try your best to make them look bad and they may do a 180 on this. To be fair, they have the right to do that. Not daying that they should or it's justified, but they totally have the right to do it. The dame thing could happen to steam as well. This is why DRM can be dangerous  Raise awareness this is completely unfair.
 This is [EA](https://youtu.be/mkRGlNNqmqk?t=15s). I have refused to buy games on Origin ever since they started the service because people have had this issue before.  I've not heard of a country being banned before but EA will ban your account whenever they feel like it and all your money for their "services" is gone.  I haven't played a Battlefield game since Bad Company 2 because of Origin.  I'd certainly get in contact with some game blogs and see if you can get some squeaky wheel going. Did anyone even like EA in the first place? This is my biggest fear in gaming. I was very leery of my first Steam purchase because I didn't know the platform well at that point and I didn't know what would happen if Valve pulled it. Now I see I actually won't be able to access games I paid for. Ugh. I hope you can get this story out to an even bigger audience, it's unethical of them. Imagine how many others are experiencing the same thing as you. This demands justice.  This makes me absolutely furious. Haven't given EA any money for at least a decade. Fuck that shitty company. > None of us has been offered a refund - just a "sorry, all your games are gone." 

Which is why I fear an all digital future. Who have ever said cloud services would be a good idea in the long run?

I don't play games that much. But I have tried Spotify. Spent a lot of time with in initially. Built my self a good set of playlists, and shared them among friends. It sucks. Once each week there were a song removed from my lists.

Keeping mp3 on my own disk is the only thing that works. This is one reason why Adobe's CC [Creative Cloud] is disliked - not actually physically selling software or serials for it, but access to it, not ownership.

Not a gaming example - but similar enough. >Remember, if they do it to me, they can do it to you too. Don't use or buy games from Origin. They will take your content away without offering a refund.

Note that this is true for ALL platforms that have online DRM. World war 3 would be a disaster for anyone with an Origin account then.  If DRM site goes to shit and I lose my games, I'm just going to pirate the games I lost and then some. If DRM companies really think they can get away using the whole of their TOS to their advantage to fuck us over and squeeze some more money, they got another thing coming. 

And I can use the money after the fact I save to get a rig. And companies wonder why piracy is such a big issue (and some people wouldn't be able to afford them anyway).  This is utterly ridiculous and insane. To terminate service in one country is one thing. But to deny literally ANYBODY who has ever spent money on your service access to their games that they bought on YOUR platform is insanity. Not even giving refunds to the games you bought is just an extra kick in the balls.


Something has to be done about this. Get a gaming news outlet to report about this, it'll blow up even more and EA is going to get complete hell. This is horrible and quite scary. I'll never understand why Origins or buying any games digitally has to be hosted all the time. When you buy a game it should be able to be downloaded and saved, given a code to install it and that's that. It's yours. I understand it's to prevent fraud. Those amazing peeps that can crack games to distribute to friends or worse sell, but then that leave all the trust to the digital companies. Which case in point they can just basically steal your games without any repercussions. I always worry that someday one of those digital companies is going to all of the sudden shut down. Then what? What happens to the games I purchased? I'm afraid the games will disappear and I won't be refunded. So I try to limit the amount of digital games and content I purchase. It sucks because I love digital games. Saves on so much space not having to have the boxes or discs.   Please for the love of God let their be a class action. dude, i had never heard of your country of residence... I just googled Myanmar and it is beautiful.  Wouldn't this logic mean a US embargo could disable Windows 10 in an entire country? So basically Origins says they can't let you play their games anymore even if you bought it? How is this legal? OP two websites have reported about your case

http://m.gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/ea-bans-pc-gamers-in-myanmar-from-accessing-origin-report-1586743

http://www.pcgamesn.com/battlefield-1/ea-origin-myanmar-trade-sanctions PCGamer has now an article about your case:
http://www.pcgamer.com/ea-blocks-entire-country-from-using-origin-accessing-purchased-games/ [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/488/) So EA was not in compliance with the law before, and now that the sanctions have been lifted they're going to comply. Makes sense. Googles Myanmar.  oh Burma. Your story was news today on the biggest tech site of the Netherlands (tweakers) We're a small country,  but your story is spreading!  I had a similar problem a while back with Ubisoft. I had bought Assassins Creed Black Flag, which requires their Uplay platform (which is completely shit BTW). I couldn't even access multiplayer from day 1, but I was fine that.

A couple of months after purchase, they patched the game, but instead of fixing anything they just broke the thing. I couldn't even access the single player campaign, offline or online. This was problem which I saw many others from my region were suffering from. There was no response from their customer support other than a half hearted, "we'll deal with it, if and when we can".

I have since resolved never to buy their games, but torrent it even if I'm not interested in playing. I share the damn thing till I get a share ratio if 2 (minimum). Fucking bastards. ''Let's take away games from average consumers in this foreign country, that'll teach their government a lesson!''

Seriously, most sanction systems are pants on head retarded and infuriating to people that can't affect their government. This is pretty disgusting.
I've come through on not purchasing any new games or content from EA for a few years now, I really do not want to sponsor a company that makes every attempt at shaking more money out of your wallet at every turn. I suggest others do the same. [deleted] Unfortunately we don't buy games anymore, we pay for a license to play them. Wish I could help more but have an upvote. I don't usually upvote content but this needs to be noticed. This is unreasonable and i definitely feel your frustration.  Just follow the same rule i do: Never buy anything from EA.

SimCity was the last straw for me. Someday everyone else will learn too. I just asked IGN Finland (freelancing there) to write about this. i would also recomend jim sterling, he has a good track record with  these kind of things  Totalbiscuit would shred EA i cant agree with this enough. media media media! they can be a-holes a lot of the time, but they pull weight What about Penny Arcade? They've been known to go on crusades against assholes before.. IGN wont care unless other websites have picked up on it.  Austin Walker and Patrick Klepek's new digs would probably be the best bet. Waypoint won't be doing the reviews at all if I heard correctly. Focused on just journalism.  (Responding to the top comment for visibility)

Hey all,

The short answer here is that this occurred due to the US government trade embargo on Myanmar.  In accordance with US law, EA is legally required to restrict online services to residents of countries that are embargoed.  This isn't an EA-specific issue -- it's an issue that impacts all companies offering services that are covered by trade embargoes.

As the OP has noted, the embargo on Myanmar appear to have been lifted earlier this month.  Accordingly, EA is internally reviewing the situation and looking into whether and when service can be restored to Myanmar residents.

It's unclear to me whether we can do anything for residents of other countries that are still similarly embargoed, but I'll bring the topic up for discussion internally. It's completely insane. I hope the gaming community goes ballistic over this, because I think this is the first time that a content distribution service has actually terminated access to an entire group of people. I can understand if one goes under, but if people don't get upset about this, there is a hell of a precedent to be set here. Also, GoG can't take back all your games even if they wanted to. DRM free, the game is yours. Also GOG is DRM-free, so you can keep playing your games even if they were to shut down their service or shut off your access to it. GOG is owned by cdpr, which is based in poland.  Plus you can download all your games drm free. GOG is amazing (after 12 years of using Steam), but I wish they had more games. GOG also doesn't use DRM Seems like a VPN works, but ping here is bad enough already. If you go through a VPN, no battlefield for you :( It is pretty much common for companies (all over the world, not just US) to ban whole countries even if sanctions are targeted to individuals, since it's not trivial nor practical to be 100% certain you can detect those people and refuse the purchase.

I disagree with this approach since if the targets of sanctions want, they can easily bypass any of this, but have seen it implemented 1st hand (and had a lot of discussions because of it). In one of the cases a country was barred from purchasing because of two individuals. It's possible they discovered one of the specific groups was using Origin. Usually in a large company like EA they just wholesale block something than try and build a filtering system. I have had to do some dumb stuff because we might possibly get sued/fined at my company.  Actually, it's quite possible they're using a type of encryption that Myanmar has, themselves, banned.

[Crypto law reference.](http://www.cryptolaw.org/cls2.htm#bi)  
[Restrictions on **import** of crypto.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_the_import_of_cryptography)

Regardless of the number of pitchforks being handed out in this thread, there are still international laws that these companies are required to follow. I don't think entirely dropping support for your service is the right approach, but at the same time I don't think a full refund is the right approach either. This is international law compliance, and the last thing EA wants to deal with is having any of their employees put on a list for detention if they ever travel to the country.

/u/trivial_sublime should contact his government (heh) and ask them to become more open to encryption (heheh) so that this doesn't happen in the future. yeah /u/EA_Alex tell us how this crap happened ?! /u/EA_Alex, I really want to play Battlefield. Please help? > /u/EA_Alex

 Also a good time to hoist the "don't buy shit from EA" flag. But he wont get the official servers and thus not as good an experience, which as a paying customer he should really be entitled to Pretty sure it was items from the red alert series and most people didn't have any issues (myself included). Don't get me wrong , the idea that steam/ea/ Ubisoft control my entire game collection scares me.  If valve were to close my steam account I would loose $1000s.  Laws need to be passed protecting consumers in regards to digital media that the purchase.  The idea that we don't own the games we purchase over steam/ origin etc is insane.  As far as I know games dissappearing from people's Origin accounts was some kind of server error. It was happening to some folks over on r/thesims too. The OP for that thread had his games under his hidden filter, they weren't removed from his account. No they were just hidden, and "showing all games" menu option allowed people to see them and play them again. [Here you go - 15 days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/57g82l/psa_origin_may_remove_games_from_your_account/) EA sperts: we took your games.

It is just with digital distribution they now have the actual ability to revoke your license.

I, too, like to live dangerously Thanks. It just sucks that they had no problem taking their money through the years of the sanctions before. There was no necessitation of an iffy decision here - they just did it - and did it AFTER Obama announced in September that sanctions would be lifted in October.

And now that the sanctions are gone, they still haven't restored our access. I'm dumbfounded. EA is an Enormous Asshole. If my experience from working at EA support has taught me anything, EA won't even have explained this to the support team so they could give an explanation when contacted by Myanmar gamers.  Thanks. It really sucks :( Yeah, but it still doesn't refund him his money. If it's  anything like in my country, the price that you pay for a game is a hefty sum (for instance, for me 60$ is my monthly food and beer budget) and plus, he probably paid the money to get the access to multiplayer. [deleted] Not really a solution for multiplayer though.  [deleted] It's not dumb to comply with sanctions if they were told they were in violation of sanctions. It's like, you know, law.  Sure steam is capable of it but in this situation they are much better because they haven't repeatedly banned whole countries, especially not as EA has done in this case - for no good reason.

Steam has the ability to commit the same offence but I fail to see how they are guilty of it since they're not the ones that have actually done it. And don't forget to mention GOG as the exception, which doesn't use DRM.

Also there are plenty of games distributed by Steam that can be run without it. I bet that was ea pr trying to bury you.

I wouldn't put it past ea to do that, I mean, they shut down an entire country because "reasons"
 Agreed. You know what happens if Steam ever closes their service? You lose access to all your games. It's DRM and lock in. its EA. They wouldn't have even slowed down to consider that for 2 seconds before picking option "fuck you" instead. Not out of malice, just because why bother even thinking about this when "fuck you" is an even easier option Have  people really been called tinfoil hatters for saying that DRM is problematic? IIRC, when Steam was launched, people were very aware of its dangers, it's just that over the years, people have gotted used to it since nothing bad ever happened (to them, anyways).  Sanctions against Myanmar were lifted on October 7th. It's been 23 days. Also, EA only started blocking Myanmar in September AFTER Obama announced sanctions were going to be lifted.  He didn't get blocked before, but _now_ he is Haha that's awesome. Poor Catherine :( Also Consumerist. EA won their "worst company in America" a couple years ago, so there's at least one media source that has no love loss Wait. Isn't that the guy from my dad wrote a porno? And funny enough, contacting this subreddit (and /r/Games) equates to contacting both of those, they are probably making a story on this withing the week now that it was here. Jim Sterling, Totalbiscuit, Superbunnyhop all good. How often does he deal with Companies banning entire countries? I think he spells it "Jim fucking Sterling son". Wow. Just briefly reading his wikipedia page, he sounds closer to a real journalist than any other games journalist I've ever seen. I can never figure out if I like or dislike him. Jim's good, but he has a tendency to not do the full research a story like this requires. Remember the Payday 2 micro-transactions? Yeah he fucked that up by listing a whole bunch of free stuff under the banner of "paid DLC".  Isn't Jim on bad terms with EA making it difficult to get an answer?  A sterling record really.   I could picture TB doing a "I will now talk about EA and Myanmar for 34 minutes" Jim Sterling is probably already making something about it, whether it's an article or video. He *loves* calling out companies on this kind of shit. But just in case, let's [notify him](http://i.imgur.com/u7bzSKl.png) that he's needed. That's because he knows cancer when he sees it.  u/videogameattorney Is the gaming side of Vice worth reading? Vice as a whole has been garbage for years now. [deleted] A trade embargo would prohibit the sale of goods. In this case, goods have already been sold. Revoke access to the store to purchase new games, sure, but taking away games they have already bought and paid for? Unacceptable. But the embargo didn't matter when it was in place, why would it change when they lifted it of all things? >It's unclear to me whether we can do anything for residents of other countries that are still similarly embargoed, but I'll bring the topic up for discussion internally.  

Offer customers a refund on the games they can no longer play.  They are in a situation they had no control over.

 Is the embargo against *selling* services, or providing them? We understand not selling games. We don't understand taking back those already sold.

Taking away twitter from citizens would be stupid, for example. ref. Arab Spring. What do you mean yer looking into whether or when services can be restored? Why isn't it just a matter of when? I think his actual intentions were not to get his games back, but to show that we are relying on the goodwill of companies and their DRM... http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37365835 ummm EA is a probly going to be in a class action suit soon the US lifted this embargo a few months ago. Why didn't you guys contact the affected customers with an apology and explanation? It would have prevented most if not all backlash. What about refunds? Is EA categorically denying refunds to those in Myanmar whose access to content you have removed? There were sanctions against Myanmar, but they were targeted toward individuals and organizations on the SDN list. There was no general trade prohibition with Myanmar, which is why services such as Steam, Battle.net, and even UPS do business in Myanmar regularly. If I had to guess, it was a business decision from EA's legal department to reduce liability. There is and was no such requirement for EA to restrict online services to Myanmar for a very long time. Absolutely. Of all the things gamers get outraged over, this should really be high on the list. I hope you bring some attention to what happened with this post. Would *really* like to see EA have to face up to this one. They might go ballistic if it were something new, but EA has already stated that they can shut down any game for any reason. They put their shitty DRM in everything just so in a few years they can shut the auth servers down and no one can play.

I never played darkspore, but I rediscovered a copy of it in my drawer and... I threw it in the trash since EA is trash and the servers no longer exist.

Randomly losing your shit purchased from EA is already commonplace. They just decided to fuck an entire country at once. Grand new scale, same old EA.

If there are any games you wanted to play, I doubt anyone would feel bad about you pirating some EA games that will run better without their crapware monitoring every keystroke.  > I think this is the first time that a content distribution service has actually terminated access to an entire group of people. 

I'm pretty sure Steam doesn't work in Crimea, because the US implemented sanctions on Crimea following the Russian annexation. >because I think this is the first time that a content distribution service has actually terminated access to an entire group of people. 

Nope. That had happened before. Steam, Origin and pretty much every other US-based service was blocked in Crimea following it's annexation by Russia.  I can't realistically get any *more* upset with EA. They've been on my permanent shitlist for years, and there's nothing they could do anymore to get me to knowingly give them money. And at least with Steam you can put your account into Offline mode and make a backup of the games for if Steam ever somehow went down forever or whatever. 

Steam provides a gaming community and infrastructure for developers, not just a sales platform, that's what's so great about it. So it's a good cause to support, it helps unify the PC gaming community. Assuming you had the foresight to download them ahead of time.  Otherwise you still need to do region unlocking tricks to download them at least. Oh, no shit? No wonder it's such a great company then. I've been using GoG for years now and I've never once had any problems with them. Slav sorcery at it finest! I just checked and while their office is in Poland they are based in Cyprus. You know, for even lower taxes. Battlefield 1 doesn't have servers in Myanmar anyways, so just pick a VPN server that lies on the same route as the BF1 server.

For example I am in North Africa. We connect to servers in Europe, so I usually connect to VPN servers in the U.K. Or Germany and I barely get 3ms increase.  This seems like your best bet OP. Become a VPN God. I would reconsider a VPN. You will get almost no additional latency if you pick a server in Europe with decent bandwidth. If you're looking for any VPN servers, I wouldn't mind helping out... as a test run to see what works :) While not great, it's just an easy way for companies to cover their ass because they can say that they made their best effort to comply. It ends up being heavy handed and effecting more people than it needs to, which sucks for those people, but then they don't get in potential trouble if they tried a more nuanced filter. That still doesn't explain why the ban was implemented weeks after sanctions were lifted.  come on /u/EA_Alex we're waiting yeah /u/EA_Alex care to explain this shit to us?! [/u/EA_Alex seeing this thread.](http://i.imgur.com/E6Q3vxV.gif)

[Edit: I was wrong.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5a51e2/ea_games_and_origin_quietly_bans_an_entire/d9e7e40/) In all seriousness, OP, they've probably been advised by their lawyers NOT to talk to you or anyone else in the countries that have been sanctioned. 

If you can, get your money back. But as a gamer, I strongly suggest you download your most favorite games from GOG and Steam --right now-- just in case Myanmar decides to shut off their internet altogether. It's been done in countries during war and civil unrest.

While that's downloading, since you're not a citizen of Myanmar, you'll want to get your passport and travel bag ready to go.  /u/EA_Alex can't ignore us forever! Come on /u/EA_Alex, fess up! What do you mean you don't know who /u/EA_Dave is????  Yeah I don't think that /u/EA_Alex wants to show up... This is worth a try, but it's also 2 weeks old and about a potentially different situation.  After so many mentions, I'm starting to think he lives in Myanmar. well this thread has blown up, so no it worked fine :P (though cross posting is always good for this type of post) [Deleted] https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5a51e2/ea_games_and_origin_quietly_bans_an_entire/ Its currently #1 on /r/all, so I'd say its doing alright.  You're right; there's always a good reason to take away stuff that people had already paid for. I'd be interested to see if there's a reason that EA would be doing this that I'd be okay with.

Several of us asked questions about this on the EA Answers forum, giving EA plenty of time to correct or respond to the champions if they were wrong. They didn't. Which is pretty stupid since the US has beef with Iran gov not some random dude trying to play videogames. If you ever visit a country that you think is "bad" you're more then likely are going to still fall in love with the land/people/culture. Most people want the same things out of life. I don't see how letting someone play videogames is a national security threat. Better stop buying from Steam also because Iran is banned there. The overall banning of countries is not an EA problem but a legal matter. Also, just because the embargo was lifted doesnt mean it becomes a top priority to EA. This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen, good luck boycotting every digital distribution platform. If you use any digital distribution service chances are you are just buying a licence to access it which can be revoked at any time. This is not new. 

News flash: If you buy digital you do not own that content! Unfortunately, that stipulation is in the Steam TOS that none of us read but all agreed to, so there isn't much we can do about it of they try it.  Just so you're aware, shit like that wouldn't fly in the EU. The US needs to have better consumer protections. That's cause when you buy something on origin and steam, you're not buying the games. You're buying licenses to use the games. Valve and EA and Ubisoft all have the right to revoke that license at any time. It's all in the ToS we agreed to. why you haf to be mad? it's only game is jus sanction Load them in a shotgun Can you vouch for the quality more than for its enormous free GB per month? Looks like the most convenient out there. THANKS! Wow, that's a lot for free. How? Worst bandwidth? Less servers in less countries? ...as opposed to the "access denied" he gets now, and not having any of his games available? Seems like there's not that much to lose right now.  Unless ea/origin reverts there decision... They didn't ban anyone who used VPN to get early access to Bf4 when it launched earlier in SE Asia, so I doubt they will here either.  I'm curious if other companies with online content distribution closed services in Myanmar due to sanctions.

Netflix? Steam? Blizzard? Hulu? Ubisoft?

If the answer is a negative on all of those then I suspect other variables are in play here.  EA (Origin) loves money, and is aggressively greedy in how it gets it.  Cutting off a source of revenue seems very unlike them.

Perhaps they used the sanctions as an excuse to close regions with suspicious account movements?  How are games priced in Myanmar, and are games purchased there globally accessible (i.e. could someone buy cheap in Myanmar and sell high on G2A?)?  Does your company have a thriving hacker community?

There are a lot of potential factors here.  It's also possible that gross incompetence played a role as well.

I doubt we'll ever get the real story here. That last bit is critical.  Most of the cost associated with my gaming library was incurred by games designed to be played online.  That's not to say that I spend my cash on in-game cosmetics and small-time DLC, but rather that I happily pay full price for the right to access global servers. Bingo, that's exactly what I've been thinking when I see all these piracy recommendations. I'm not necessarily against piracy under certain circumstances, but in this case it will do OP precisely zero good to waste his bandwidth torrenting games that won't work with multiplayer.  Valve has banned Iran and Crimea from buying games off Steam, although to my knowledge they didn't revoke all access. Not sure what they did about multiplayer titles though. I know Blizzard has banned all account access for those in Crimea, Iran, and Myanmar though. Possibly, i long since stopped caring for EA, I am not surprised they'd do something like this when they care so little about their users. Knowing how slowly government and big corporations seem to work EA probably just got the months old notice delivered to the Origin network team.. or something. The same year that BP oil spill was still going on.  Yeah.  That was a 4chan raid and nothing more.  It's a fucking joke.  The consumerist doesn't have nearly as much pull as you think.  EA has only grown bigger since then.  well they are still recording record profits so everyone is still buying there goods. Yes and it does make for some disturbing imagery when listening to the podcasts.  The vole, yes.  Fuck.

That had never occurred to me before! *He's got a monster prick, he's got a monster prick* nope. but similar vein His son is an amazing athlete!! Belinda Blinked?!

 That went dark quick  Dude... thats a bit cynical of you, dont you think? r/jesuschristreddit
 The funny thing is that Origin customers had no problems *during* the embargo.  But for some reason EA has decided to enforce it now that its over. Sale of goods *and services*. I don't know if you've noticed but people technically don't own their digital games anymore and haven't owned them for years. Why do you think intrusive DRM is allowed? Can you refund to embargoed countries?  They have no access to the store whatsoever. So it's probably *impossible* to get a refund based on that alone. I just hope this doesn't get buried - "It's not my problem" is a tough mindset to bypass. 

We need to send a message to EA and every content distributor that this kind of behavior is NOT okay, and that if your access is revoked because of their decision, that they need to refund everything that you've paid into it. Oddly enough, though, they've been relinquishing their hold on some big properties to GOG as of late. Last month saw Spore, Mirrors Edge, Dragon Age, Dead Space. And just a few days ago Crysis and Medal of Honor. These are old games, yeah, but they're pretty much the only post-2000 titles for EA on GOG. Not to praise them too much or anything, but credit where credits due; especially when it was looking like, with Origin, that they'd be taking all their properties off other distributions and keeping their toys to themselves. [deleted] In Crimea Steam works fine except the buying thing. Origin, on the other hand, doesnt allow anything, buy, download and play. Yeah honestly seems like it is just a matter of time before the rest go offline Actually, i've been there in september, worked finel Only buying, at least you can play your games iirc. There is also steam auto cracker. So even if you get banned from steam you can crack the games you allready downloaded with ease. > And at least with Steam you can put your account into Offline mode and make a backup of the games for if Steam ever somehow went down forever or whatever. 

Untrue.

There are exceptions like games that use Denuvo that are on Steam like MGS Phantom Pain.

The Steam offline function to use your game you bought through Steam will only work forever if the game uses Valve's in-house DRM and there is no indication within Steam whether it does or not.

If the game uses a third party DRM or uses Valve's CEG, it will eventually not work. I mean, if you've bought a game you've probably downloaded it at least once...

edit: I don't have as many games as you all Yeah, CD Projekt pays taxes in Poland, GOG in Cyprus.  Where are you in North Africa.  Tunisia here. Jesus, I'm constantly reminded what a lucky shit I am for living in western Europe... Big companies move slow, order could have come down from legal to block the region and no one bothered to look and see if the situation changed. /u/EA_Alex is probably going to the bathroom It's the weekend, I guess /u/EA_Alex and /u/EA_Dave are at home right now.  I don't know who /u/EA_Alex is, but I'd sure like to hear what they've got to say. Yes he can. Not to slight OPs problem but the bigger issue in terms of for the greater gaming community is that Origin is doing a blanket ban on not just buying new games (i.e. what a complete sanction should do) but also locking you out of your old games which were legitimately bought. From what I've read in this thread, Steam may prevent you from buying new games in sanctioned countries but it shouldn't lock you out of your existing library. There are hundreds of DRM-free games on Steam. On GOG there are almost two thousand. That's close enough to owning the content. If you want to nitpick and accept the industry's legal fictions, you only own a license on your physical box games as well. Laws can debunk TOS even if you sign it.  If you sign away your house and your first born they still can't take it.   Just pirate it, you purchased the license, thats all that matter. The bit in the "Termination by Valve" clause that says you won't get a refund is attached to the sub-clause saying they can terminate it because you violated the TOS in some way; it explicitly states that to be the case.  

The clause saying they can terminate your account if they also terminate the account of everyone similarly located doesn't have it. If challenged with enough money, there's no way that part of the TOS would hold up in court.  TOS are not the law. They could put a term in there that would require them to kill your firstborn if you don't buy a game for 2 months. Just because you agree to it doesn't mean they can now just kill your firstborn and be in the right. The chart you sign has no bearing if it contradicts the law. And a law is retroactive if it benefits you.

So I would say we can do a lot, if we want to. If there was a significant activism on that matter, laws can be passed. We need all sorts of better protections over here. That brings a new meaning to buckshot. I'm not sure to be honest. It's the only VPN I've ever used and I basically only use it to access my HBO Go while overseas. But it's simple to use and allows me to stream just fine.  I can personally vouch for windscribe. Fantastic vpn. I'm actually not sure. It's the only VPN I've used so I can't really compare it to anything. But it serves the small purpose I use it for (streaming shows overseas). I think a reversion or an appeal is exactly why it'd be a bad idea. A banned account certainly won't get its games back or a refund.  As u/MLG_SlashySouls stated if the decision is indeed reverted then it can potentially ruin any chance of access to that account. Taking a vigilante stance is foolish. See, this is most probable. EA didn't just say "well fuck you Mayanmar!". Either they are doing it because they were told to comply with the sanctions or they were unsure if they fell under the sanctions but already had problems with the country so they rather than vest money in sorting it out said lets just drop them until the sanctions are lifted and we will revisit.  What I'm thinking happened is that someone in their legal department had an "Oh, shit" moment when they heard the announcement that the sanctions were ending and decided to do some sort of CYA. There are a lot of regulatory situations where demonstrating a good faith effort to comply with the law can get you off the hook. I've never gotten the BP comparison. The survey made it clear before and after (they even ran a separate piece explaining it again in detail) that it wasn't about which company had the biggest negative impact on the world. 

>[“This is the same poll that last year judged us as worse than companies responsible for the biggest oil spill in history,” writes Moore. He’s obviously referencing the 2011 champ BP, except BP wasn’t even in the bracket last year. In response to Moore’s statement, we’d like to take a moment to explain that our “Worst Company in America” contest exists within the context of this website, which is about consumers and their relationship to the marketplace and to businesses. Just to be clear: The point of this contest, now in its 8th year, is to enable consumers to send a message to a company that provides goods or services to them. Winning this contest means your customers are trying to tell you something. And that something is that you, out of all the companies, most deserve a plastic poop trophy.](https://consumerist.com/2013/04/05/ea-admits-it-can-do-better-but-blames-worst-company-success-on-homophobes-and-whiny-madden-fans/)

It's kind of annoying that the same deflection that EA gave was adopted by the same people they continue to screw over.  Not relevent but my 7 month old daughter accidently hit my screen and just gave you her first upvote. Dont spend it all in 1 place.  They raided consumerist 2 years in a row?

https://www.cnet.com/news/how-electronic-arts-stopped-being-the-worst-company-in-america/

I'm not saying they would have the "make everything better" article, but they're at least a media source that has a higher chance of running an article. Then maybe other outlets run with it.

...or nothing happens. Just trying to list options. Note it's worst company in America. BP is British Petroleum. Like him and Roadhog going at it and just pounding it?

[Just pounding it... Pounding it... Pounding it...!](https://youtu.be/kQxy_rvv8a4#t=8m2s) glad it wasn't just me having flashbacks to zombie cocks. cause he's Jim Fucking Sterling, Son. I dunno if Jim is one to talk after Poggate. Especially now that he knows EA considers him a bit of a Wildcard and refuses to send him review copies of games. As of September 23 the tumor was 2cm down from 5, so I'd say it didn't get as quite as dark as you'd think. >Dude... thats a brit cynical of you, dont you think?

ftfy
 Well, just a brit. I mean EA never had a good track record. Yeah this is what confuses me. US-Myanmar relations are better now than they've been in decades, and suddenly EA discovers that we had an embargo for decades, during which they sold their games in the country? Either EA is wholly ignorant of international relations, or this isn't the real reason.  What a wonderful catch-22. Yeah, that's incredible. Especially when their DRM is so restrictive.

This is why I actually really like to give GOG money. DRM-free, consumer friendly, not American, all that good stuff. I'm outraged, but I have no idea what to do about it. I suspect slamming my keys extra hard while typing this comment won't help. That is really interesting actually. They have screwed up so much already with their platform I'm surprised they would do this, sort of admitting their own shit is... shit.  Well it's humans we're dealing with. Humans created EA. What wouldn't you expect at this point? :P

I usually do this just for a more noticeable space between thoughts. Interesting how r/gaming formats it.

I pirated games when I didn't have a job. Now that I have a source of income, I feel like pirating isn't worth the effort. Though I wouldn't mind donating some bandwidth to seed some EA games just because fuck EA. Not many things bother me as much as DRM. I get that you want to protect your ip but why should that harm legitimate customers while pirates can still easily get your game? It clearly isn't working so I don't see why they keep making it shittier for the target end user... It was reasonable the first time, it was utterly retarded during AC2 (the auth servers went down and ONLY pirates could play, GG ubisoft), and now it would just be nice if they withdrew a little bit  >_> At the same time? Seriously?

Whining about people "stealing" and then trying to shame them for expecting the goods they paid for takes a special kind of stupid. This is what confuses me. I get not letting people buy games - that's the law, and EA have to abide by it, however much it sucks for their consumers. What I don't understand is why they can't play games that they already bought. Isn't the point of economic sanctions to, you know, sanction the economy? Exactly what part of the Burmese economy is involved in playing an already purchased game? Please elaborate it seems google filters this a bit cuz I can't find shit about it.  That's pretty irrelevant. If a game has third party DRM, it's going to have it on any platform, it's not inherent to Steam, so Steam is not to blame.

As for Valve CEG, that works in offline mode. CEG is like a half-way DRM, its only real purpose it to prevent you from simply sharing your Steam games with other people, Steam generates a custom executable of the game that only runs under that Steam Account. As long as you've run the game once before going into offline mode, that executable will have been generated and will work with that Steam account in offline mode. Whereas games without Valve CEG or other Third Party DRM could be sent to other people and work in their offline mode accounts.

If a game you have on Steam does not have any DRM ([there are MANY such games, though this is not a complete list at all](http://steam.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_DRM-free_games)), then you don't even need to go into Offline mode, just backup those game folders, they don't rely on Steam at all.
 You must not have 200+ steam games in your library yet ah ah ah ah. Nope.

I downloaded about 10% of my gog library. I bought a lot of packs and didn't have time yet to consider all those games. I think I've downloaded maybe a fourth of the games I own? Too many sales.

Except pirated versions often don't do multiplayer. I find it hilarious that these companies can just take away your games any time they choose by banning you. Actually, you're not buying the games, your just renting them for unspecified amount fo time. Pirating for life, fuck their TOS.  Not to mention the BP spill was an accident but EA's continued antics is corporate policy.  It's actually incredibly relevant. What you just witnessed is the average integrity of online voting.  The science guy

Edit : Now my most upvoted comment, and so simple too, thanks reddit! :) Well, I just made my 3 year old give her first upvote to you.  Its a stupid 4chan/reddit circlejerks voting EA the worst company in America. There are so many companies that do so much worse. It's an online poll, that's alone makes it a joke.  That was an Internet joke.  That year banks bankrupted the country and no had their oil spill.  But ea is more evil because mass effect was rushed.  Give me a break.  Actually it's been just 'BP' since 2001 after it merged with a couple of American oil companies. It's still headquartered in the UK, but it's not entirely British anymore. It's 50% American owned... That's their roots but they haven't used the name British Petroleum for a long long time.  BP America is based in the USA Thank God for him.  WILD CARD BITCHES WILDCARD BITCHES! Well how long left before he pass the average lifespan? If I can get my money back from EA, maybe I'll take it to GOG :( I love GOG. CD projekt has their priorities straight. We live in strange times when "not American" is a good thing in regards to property rights. Even if GOG banned your account, they can't take away a game you already downloaded. Buying your games DRM-free (e.g. from GOG) in the future would be a start, that prevents it from happening to you at any point.  Steam has bad DRM some people figgured out how it works and generate automatic crack for almost any game. Exactly. I have 5.5TB of storage in my desktop and only have on there the steam/origin games that I actually run and a few gog games that I have lying about (not all of the gog games obviously) and some other-source downloads.

 What games does the military ban? The BP spill was negligence. If you put your car in drive, get it started down the road, and hop out, it's going to hit something. That's not an accident.  [An accident caused by BP's utter negligence of safety protocols.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11720907)

[Utter negligence that they further tried to hide by deleting any evidence of previous knowledge to the inevitable risk.](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/04/24/first-criminal-charges-filed-in-deepwater-horizon-accident/)

[An accident that, when given the opportunity to fix it, BP decided to further cut corners by using a dispersant magnitudes more toxic than oil.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50032789/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/dispersant-makes-oil-spills-times-more-toxic/)

EA's a bad company, but to honestly sit there and chalk up a series of negligent acts that lead to the loss of life and natural damage on a scale inconceivable without the use of weapons because "muh video games" is just fundamentally disconnected from reality. This was the result of a series of EXECUTIVE decisions on BP's part that lead to the spill's damage escalating without rebuke.

Consumerist has their criteria for the contest, I get that, but to sit there and try to pass off an act of total negligence as just a whimsical accident to further a lopsided point is just utter incompetence. BP's negligence is corporate policy. Watch deep water horizon - great film. I'm pretty sure I've given more accidental votes by touching the screen during scrolling or dropping my phone on my face than I have legitimate ones. Bill Bill Bill Bill  They don't count if you MAKE them do it!  Nestle is the devil. EA sucks, but Nestle has no regard for human life in the pursuit of profits Yeah, lost a lot of respect for the consumerist and reddit when that happened. EA sucks and all but jesus they're not a private prison company or destroying the global environment.

Edit: to all the people complaining the consumerist [covers private prisons](https://consumerist.com/tag/prisons/) and [covered the BP oil spill.](https://consumerist.com/tag/gulf-oil-spill/).  Consumer issues aren't just support.  1998 was when it actually stopped being called British Petroleum, when it merged with Amoco, and became BP Amoco plc. 2001 was just when it changed again following more mergers with US oil companies, and became just 'BP'. Headquarters in England make it British. Derp Two years. He could be around for a long time after that though. this isn't the first time something like this pops up from Origin, i remenber there was a dude claiming some of his games had just simply disapeared, it makes me kind of glad that i haven't bought anything on origin. Or you'll pirate it and feel absolutely justifed in doing so. Not at you, because of course you would never do such a thing, **right**, but if anyone in Sales for any company ever is wondering *why* someone might then here's a great example. Even if you move to GOG, don't lower your guard.  While they boldly tout that DRM-free store thing on their front page, if you dig deeper, you'll find that most recent (and many not so recent) multiplayer games aren't DRM free at all, and you'll still have to deal with CD keys, accounts with publishers' servers, mandatory Galaxy (where service is denied if you can't access your GOG account or don't have the given game in your library), etc. CD Project Red is the game studio. Mother company is just CD Project. US property law favors the producer, not the consumer. If you're producing intellectual property of any kind, from music to software to a new drug you want to live in the US. If you want to buy any of that stuff though....

It's a little bit of a catch22. Everyone wants American stuff, just in a different country.  American laws have never been very consumer friendly. Which really is not an option when it comes to multiplayer games. Nekopara?

Taking over Carthage doesn't give you aggressive expansion in Europe. Does /u/EA_Alex like Ariana Grande? Explain yourself /u/EA_Alex Or.. or or or put it into a shit museum, I don't care!  Good  I don't have an Origin or EA game, so I don't think  /u/EA_Alex can block me. I mostly play Bejeweled 2. I'm just here to ask if /u/EA_Alex likes Ariana Grande. /u/EA_Alex and /u/EA_Dave should really answer our questions anyway. Yea, /u/EA_Alex and /u/EA_Dave work together at EA's marketing and PR department.

They are the poor sods that were assigned to communicate with redditors. /u/EA_Alex and /u/EA_Dave should really answer our questions.  > u/EA_Alex

 Is this about that stupid meme on /r/jokes. /u/EA_Alex, where are ya mate? You're ignoring us! /u/EA_Alex, /u/EA_Alex, where art thou, /u/EA_Alex? But will /u/EA_Alex answer our questions?  That's who we're summoning,  /r/EA_Alex  There's a staggering amount of ignorance in these comments; thank you for having common sense and reason. Criteria aside, the two are just not comparable. You can [always check](https://www.reddit.com/u/me/upvoted). [Mayo! Mayo! Mayo!](https://youtu.be/KiuO_Z2_AD4) Blatant upvote fraud, but of course the media and the FBI aren't going to say anything about it. Typical really. My 5 year old enjoyed making the up arrow on your post turn orange. It was her first upvote but I'm sure it won't be her last.  Tell her that! She's been cryin about me wasting it for like an hour! Nestle is also not an American company.  Weren't they the ones bottling water in Cali and sending it elsewhere right in the middle of a water shortage?

EDIT: grammar crackers Regardless of which company is literally the Devil. In the gross majority of places Nestle provides a somewhat sound product. If I were to send a mail to Nestle saying that I dislike a change they made chances are I will recieve a coupon for nestle products and they will apologize in some way. 

While I understand that many of their practices, like lobbying to keep private prisons a thing just so they can profit of people's life's being ruined, is horrible and de-humanizing. they're still a 'decent' company from a consumer standpoint

--
Nobody is arguing here that there's 'more evil' companies. But the consumerist is a Consumer magazine, not an humanitarian magazine. Companies like EA and Comcast are horrible companies from a consumer standpoint. They overprice their services, make you go out of your way to do simple things. EA will release unfinished products for full price or release products that simply aren't good. They will make embargos to make sure nobody can actually see how bad a product is before launch. They constantly do their best to 'mislead' the customer as legally as possible.

There's no surprise a game company is labelled the 'worst' company. Lately people have been fed up with being fed horseshit that they have to pre-order or pay extra for *on launch* just to get a full experience. **And yes, I know that you shouldn't pre-order**. But as it stands the only way to actually get ALL content in most games is to either pre-order and get some weapon/skin/package bonus, or to pirate it. And I would rather pay for my games.

**TL;DR** The Consumerist has EA labelled as top worst company because it's a consumer site, not a humanitarian site. For the 'average' consumer nestle products do what they're supposed to and are often 'tasty'. Meanwhile EA screws over their consumers over and over, promising the world and feeding them shite. I work a lot of events in El Paso and Cruces as support staff or volunteer, and goddamn if every fugging time we are provided bottles of Nestle Pure Life water.  Wtf is wrong with that water?  It always tastes "off".  However it beats the tap water down here.  
I know Nestle's horrid history, especially with slave labor and the baby formula murders.  I hate Nestle. But mAh vidyagames IIRC the two years average is brought down by the fact that a lot of older people get the kind of cancer that he has, and don't usually make it as long. Well, this fucking happened to me. I bought battlefield bad company and battlefield bad company 2 through steam (before origin). Didn't play them a few years after my initial hype, but wanted to get back into it because my brother did. Tried to log on, steam redirected me to origin, downloaded that shit and tried to play. And it said my CD keys were already in use. Fuck that shit, fuck origin, I emailed them and their customer service was fucking useless and basically said they had no way of proving I was the original owner and would have to rebuy the games if I wanted to play. Go. Fuck. Yourself. Never playing an EA game again. The DMCA rules have recently been updated. If I understand them correctly, he would'nt even be pirating:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/28/toaster_penetration_testing_green_lighted/
"Efforts to make non-functioning video games accessible." I haven't bought an EA game since NBA 2k4. But this kind of shit right here makes me wanna download their whole library and seed it just to fuck EA in any way I can. Just out of curiosity, is it even considered "piracy" if you already paid for the right to use a product? It's ok to pirate something if you own the game, am I right? I mean, I _own_ the original Age of Empires II, but I may not have access to the disk, so I might as well download it permanantly I feel so bad for the programmers and designers at ea, they make amazing games but then have those games ripped apart by shitty business people They stated that the games are DRM-free in terms of **singleplayer** games afaik. As of multiplayer, ya can still play it without Galaxy but LAN only. Seems kind of like grasping at straws. Others have clearly explained how GOG can't do anything about the way many multiplayer games work. It's not up to GOG when it comes to multiplayer DRM as they aren't in control of it. 

All singleplayer games on GOG are completely DRM free and can be downloaded, installed, and backed up as many times as you want. They are yours do do with as you please.  Unfortunately, the way a lot of games are, the multiplayer aspects are a form of DRM, and since it involves gameplay there's only so much that GOG can do about it.  Addressing this issue is a more systemic problem, and I don't think one distributor (except maybe Steam, but that's a very long shot) could fix it. This is true. Actually. This is why I prefer GOG when it comes down to indie games and games that are single players.  There is a massive difference between "You can't download and play this game at your discretion" and "You are unable to use online features that require server validation" - you can't put blame on CD Projekt for the absolutely necessary digital rights management of publishers to administer their online game components.

Anti-cheat and the very act of logging into a game server basically requires some form of DRM in order to function with any kind of modern security. GOG has never promised DRM free multiplayer. They've included that in all of their press releases about multiplayer and DRM free things since they started. Or CD Proje**k**t, if we are to be precise. How rude. You could ask at least. yea its winter here, the snow has already come for like a week back or so Carthago delenda est! I think /u/EA_Alex is more of a Taylor Swift guy I feel at least a little bad for /u/EA_Alex and /u/EA_Dave. PR people need weekends too. On Monday they're gonna find all these people calling for their blood, when EA as a company is really who we need to be blaming here. 

Though I will also say: if scheduling is the problem and there are two people - they really should consider taking different days so at least one of them is always around even on weekends. I think they regret their jobs right now  I bet they have no problems playing Battlefield right now. Dude, everyone knows /u/EA_Dave! Right /u/EA_Alex? I assume that /u/EA_Alex has to report back to management first, since there are no easy answers to this issue.

I want /u/EA_Alex to tell me whether EA's "fuck the customer" policy is still in effect or not. I want to get off /u/EA_Alex's wild ride. You had one thing to do: cast /u/EA_Alex. You fucked up. /u/EA_Alex has his own subreddit now?!?! I'm constantly expecting "Bill Nye the science guy" but it never comes  Perfect example of how sound changes depending on context. Such a nasty redditor. You are correct, they aren't. I'm not a smart man, I misinterpreted "in America" to mean doing business in, but I guess the point here is worst American company. They still suck.  They're swiss Their CEO or something also said water shouldn't be a human right. Also spots on the liver.  I didn't even need an experience like that myself to boycott EA. They and Ubisoft are pretty much the ones to blame for shitty micro transactions everywhere, full priced beta testing when buying games at release, taking out content to sell it extra as DLC later and all the other stuff making potentially interesting games a complete shit show. Of course the consumers who still buy their shit are at fault aswell. Same happened to me. I got so mad This happened to me with The Crew on Uplay.   Bought The Crew + an expansion for it when it was on sale but didn't download or play it for a while.   When I finally did decide to play it (like almost a year later), I downloaded it via Steam but had to sign into Uplay first before playing.  Uplay insisted that I the key I installed was for just the base game but steam had downloaded the base game + expansion, so it would let me play like the first mission before kicking me out and asking me to purchase the expansion (again).   Tried re-installing and the same thing happened.  I could play the base game if I Uninstalled it on steam and re-installed it on Uplay only but I paid for both the base + expansion.   Pissed me off so much I just Uninstalled Uplay.  I had a problem with an EA game and support hung up on me after an hour telling me I was wasting too much of their time. They haven't updated my ticket with a response in over 10 days. do not trust them. Bad company was never released on PC.  Bad company 2 was.

The proof they want is your steam order history and a screenshot of it in your library.  They gave me the Sims this way, so I know they will.

And bad company 2 has never redirected to origin unless you've forgotten your login information.  Not sure how that's EA's fault. 2k sports games are made by 2k. EA makes the NBA Live series.  True, but most multiplayer games these days don't support LAN regardless of DRM I'm not defending the draconian DRM some games use, but in the multiplayer case you want something there. Without anything that could be termed "DRM" you can't ban anyone. If you can't ban anyone, then your game is a harassment and cheat fest. Finally someone gets it. Jesus, Living next to malmö and its still kind of cozy. /u/EA_Alex we are waiting for you... /u/EA_Alex is a snek 🐍🐍🐍 As long as it's not Justin Bieber (right, /u/EA_Alex? Please?) No no he means that this thread is now /u/EA_Alex 's personal sub Haha no disagreement there!  He said the exact opposite.

FTFY Wait so you don't want to pay $30 for one map? How about we offer you a great deal for two maps for $70 and throw in a special emblem of a lolipop. Well it was probably a LIVE title then.

Now let's jump off buildings and stab some motherfucking templars Reminds me of [this](http://img.cinemablend.com/cb/1/4/d/a/d/f/14dadff8a5f07424ed952210dafdeea3b702a99125c102353af9756a0dd2817c.jpg) warning about Tom and Jerry. That's a classy way to state it.  I clicked thinking "oh here we go again", but I actually like the way they worded it.  If movies can tackle racism, why can't games? Classy, non-apologetic and well thought disclaimer, in my opinion. Let's hope the racism won't disturb me while i murder some people. You know that some suburban mom is going to buy this for her 10 year old son, then try to sue when she hears the n-word. This should be self-explanatory, but its just classy nonetheless I like that "and still face" inclusion they made. Go ahead, sort the comments by controversial. I dare you. I started watching West Wing and it gets troubling when a show created 10 years ago was discussing gun violence, racism, and high rate of police brutality amongst the black communities. 

We can't just ignore the problems we have and expect change.  So...it's a trigger warning. I don't care i just want to feed people to alligators. Racism capped at 30fps This is similar to the Warner Brothers cartoon disclaimer 
http://i.imgur.com/U8UZyVI.jpg It's a good move on the part of the developers, it helps to reflect the views of the studio towards racism and leaves little room towards speculation about how and why is racism being used in the game. btw this is what an actual trigger warning is.

Not the made-up, exaggerated version people who complain about "SJWs" think exists And that folks, is how you do PR right. Sincerity goes a long way. It's probably too late now, but I think you should turn back and *not* read anything in this thread. I find it very well worded and very nice that they include that however at the same time it is sad that thr devs have to include this statement I Bet some news team or some dumbass is going to try and take racist parts of mafia 3 out of context and try to use it to make video games look bad. "Look how racist gamers have become!"  These kinds of splash screens are nothing new. Several games old and new have these things which say "this game is a work of fiction and do not portray the feelings or beliefs of the publisher, etc". The Anti-PC people are getting to be just as bad as the other side :/. This is a non issue people, just play the freakin game Is that also why it's only 30FPS? Cause they want people to have the experience of playing on a crappy old televisions? They're telling a story, this disclaimer puts it nicely.  i can't believe we need disclaimers and bullshit like this. ITT: people triggered by the concept of the devs trying to be respectful A lot of posters seem to be jumping at the opportunity to bemoan this as another example of a concession forced on developers by the rabid SJW super organism, when in fact this sort of thing has been happening for a long time in all forms of media, be it TV, movies, radio, books...  But no, clearly Obama is coming for your guns and the feminazis are coming for your vidyas. I was a little taken aback by the disclaimer the first time I booted it up.  It does make sense, since everyone complains nowadays.  

I recall an article about Witcher 3, shortly after it's release, where the author complained to no end about how weak, marginalized and victimized the women in the story were.  Then I played the game, and realized the most powerful protagonist, who the player controls for some of the game is female.  
People will complain about any social 'inequity' in the mainstream now, usually with little understanding of context or use of critical thinking.  Why research and understand when you can be offended and complain to the world, via the internet?  

Mafia 3 is chock full of racial tension, I've only played 3 hours or so, but the last ambient conversation I overheard was a redneck enforcer talking about how surprisingly adept 'colored gals' are at fellatio.  I can imagine things like this setting SJW types off.  


Game is great thus far, by the way.  Fucking excellently put, much respect to the devs. Meanwhile BF1 has black Germans... Sadly, the people this message is intended for will still not take this to heart and there will be a highly vocal minority of people against this game. I can guarantee that. So I saw the first couple hours of gameplay yesterday. It's nice that they went for it, but I don't think it really delivers on the promise of realistic depictions of racism. They lean hard on it in a not-at-all-subtle or interesting way, so lots of the dialog rings false. In many ways, it shows us stereotypical stories of racism without giving us any of the atmosphere of racial tension. 

I found it disappointing that police ignore your character unless he kills someone in their presence. There doesn't appear to be any gameplay effect for driving/running through white neighborhoods.

Also found it disappointing that there's no anti-veteran subtext. The fact that the main character openly admits serving in Vietnam (to strangers no less) is really dumb, given that actual veterans were spat on by passers-by after the war and many hid their service. Classy! I am buying this game. That is how you handle edgy content! The sad part is that this even needs to be said. Good. They're not trying to promote racism, they're showing how it was at that time. "...so shut the fuck up in advance, Polygon." I love you Glad to see not all companies think it's 1984. Honestly, the more we let this stuff (racist and sexist language) surface, linger, circulate, and proliferate the less power it'll have... which is great.

From a Louis CK show: "Racism isn't what you say, it's what you do." And there's a lot of truth to that. Words only have the power we give them... but actions have power of their own. Does anyone remember the airport level from call of duty? They asked if you'd like to skip it because a similar event had happened in real life around the time it was released.  This is great and courageous of the publisher. I wish more period piece entertainment were true to our ugly past, like how Mad Men illustrates the unapologetic sexism of the time. Culturally, we need reminders. They're talking about the stereotype of Italian people being in the mafia, *right*? The people who would take exception of this kind of thing should be forced to apologize for trying to be revisionists by seeking to hide and minimize reality past or present. We should never stand for it. History. It's a thing. For better or worse. I'm glad people are being reminded of this, because they probably need it.  "Our game's story features racist elements, but we're not racist we promise so please don't blog about us" Hey...when will we get a hispanic protaginst? I do like that disclaimer though and I don't know why And how many templars dos the team have? None. Is this equality? That pisses off /pol/ to no end. I love it. The Big Loony Toons anthologies have the same disclaimers.

It's much better than burying that stuff. As a kid I never noticed the racist shit in the Looney Tunes, but I was watching it with my daughter the other day and I was fucking stunned by some of the shit in there. And [this](http://i.imgur.com/3Wds9as.jpg) warning about Looney Tunes.

**Edit:** I thought T&J were Hanna&Barbera + MGM, though. But more importantly, where can I find an uncensored Tom & Jerry collection? The only ones available on Amazon et.al. have a shit-ton of stuff removed from individual cartoons (or sometimes entire episodes). That's really neat. I give this gold because it is so relevant. Tom and Jerry was my favourite show as a kid but my parents told me that there were some stereotypes in it which were a product of the time.  The similarity of our usernames scares me. [Looney Tunes Collection has a similiar disclaimer](http://i.imgur.com/U8UZyVI.jpg) I hate that it has to be stated. The fact that a disclaimer like this is needed says a lot about our society today. I think the short answer is that movies can control their tone while open world games can only do so to a limited degree. I certainly wouldn't want my hard work used as a racism simulator and so I think its one of those things that if you are going to include it artistically, you need to make an effort to set that tone. I think this message does so... But wait, they wrote it with white on a black background. What does that mean, whites are superior to blacks or something? "I'm disemboweling this guy and it's going great but then someone yelled the "n" word and i was completely disgusted" Funny story, when I was 18 I applied at EB games for a job. The manager gave me a scenario for a mom coming in to buy her son a game that was rated M and asked how I would help her. I asked how old the child was, she said... 12 or something around there. I told her I would tell her she probably shouldn't buy him that game because it was rated Mature. It contains X, Y, and Z and those are the reasons it has the rating, I had also played the game and told her I didn't care for it. It also scored very poorly on most game scores and I recommended another game, I forget which. I did not get the job for two reasons, one it just so happens that was the managers favorite game and two I didn't "close" the sale. For the life of me I can't remember the game but I remember the entire exchange because I thought it was so surreal.  I thought racism ended with with Obama though! Surprisingly not as bad as I expected, but still. LIBERALS GET SO TRIGGERED BY EVERYTHING! BLM WANTS TO KILL ALL WHITE PEOPLE! /s I expected worse. Just a bunch of circle jerks about PC culture being to blame (shocking) and how this disclaimer shouldn't be needed, etc.  >Go ahead, sort the comments by controversial. I dare you.

I waa having a good afternoon and now it's ruined The West Wing brings the issues up, The Wire shows why change is so hard, and things end up repeating. Have you reached Sam's speech about the importance of vetting a Supreme Court candidate against the issues of the future?

It still gives me chills how accurate it was at predicting the issues being considered by the court these days. I was watching The Wire and there were multiple times where I had forgotten that this movie came out over a decade ago, because their depiction of Baltimore and its problems is almost near identical to the state Baltimore is in today. What do you mean when you say it gets troubling? That it's bad? Sorry, just confused with the wording Or maybe the policies put in place to combat these things don't work. If only they could have prepped for the onslaught of gamers triggered by 30fps.   Or a "please don't write us letters, idiots" warning. Nah, I think it's less about the player and more about the game's reputation and preventing bad publicity. If they hadn't put this in, some clickbait-y non-gaming site would declare Mafia 3 to be a "racist video game" and write some hot shareable news story on it to paint Hangar 13 racist, and THEN Hangar 13 would have to put out a statement like this to clarify their intent. Including this statement in the game upfront shuts down those dumb clickbait-y people before they even have a chance. With anything that could be construed as controversial, always good to err on the side of clarity.
EDIT: spelling... I would almost say that it is the opposite.  It isn't saying to cover your eyes when there's racism; it's saying, while we don't agree with it, the racism has to be there to tell the story and to provide an accurate depiction of the setting, so you will just have to accept the reality that racism exists to play this game. But they couldn't call it that or they'd trigger the shit out of a bunch of redditors who'd parade around the internet declaring Mafia III "SJW garbage" or somesuch. Yes, but one that's actually tastefully done and not about like, fucking, pomegranates that might be mistaken for human hearts. Yeah exactly.  Is that a bad thing? I've only played a couple hours so far but they seem to have handled it really well so far.  It's not overwhelping the story, but continuously simmering under the surface.  It feels genuine, rather than a gimmick or excuse to throw around slurs It reminds me of the recent DVD disclosure/warning on some classic Looney Tunes collections that feature old timey folksy racism as it was and in context. 

The proper way to show what was without groveling about the content, IMNSHO. The amount of posts that turn into politics arguments is getting ridiculous now. Can't wait for this election to be over… The irony is palpable sorting by controversial in this thread is real masturbation material Fuck if I wasn't poor you'd have my gold. Hell, I remember the first Assassin's Creed having a similar disclaimer, what with the whole crusades thing. Didn't Modern Warfare 2 have something similar or with the airport level? > feminazis are coming for your vidya buttz.

Get with the narrative. Didn't Modern Warfare 2 have something similar or with the airport level? I was just about to say. Remasters of Disney films have this message at the beginning when its films from the 50's. > I recall an article about Witcher 3, shortly after it's release, where the author complained to no end about how weak, marginalized and victimized the women in the story were. Then I played the game, and realized the most powerful protagonist, who the player controls for much of the game is female.

Not to mention all of the sorceresses are orders of *magnitude* more powerful than Geralt. While they have to take time to craft and cast more powerful spells, Geralt is *only* superhuman. Sorceresses regularly violate the laws of physics. And Ciri is even stronger. I agree with you mainly, but saying that you play as Ciri for much of the game is blatantly dishonest, the Ciri missions probably take up about 5% of the game in total, less if you include DLC Lol someone thought the women in witCher 3 were shown as weak and marginalized.  That last mission you play as Ciri... Holy fuck... But the best part is the message preempts that, by declaring that removing it would be disrespectful. So the complainer has to be on the side of disrespectful to directly complain about his. There already is. Check steam discussions. People are already calling this game and the devs SJW's or how it's racist against white people. >Also found it disappointing that there's no anti-veteran subtext. The fact that the main character openly admits serving in Vietnam (to strangers no less) is really dumb, given that actual veterans were spat on by passers-by after the war and many hid their service.

That's because such incidents were largely apocryphal. Dr. Jerry Lembcke's *The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory and the Legacy of Vietnam* concerning returning Vietnam vets found little actual evidence or verified accounts of people systemically spitting on troops actually happening.  

It's America's version of the ol' "Stabbed in the Back" narrative from post-WWI Germany. Go read some of the more bitter right wing works on the war and it aligns almost perfectly. 

 *"Our brave troops didn't lose on the battlefield! They were stabbed in the back right before the moment of victory by the ~~November Criminals~~ media, ~~Jews~~ liberal college professors and ~~Bolsheviks~~ hippies!"*

"They spit on veterans" tales and related urban legends push a narrative of the anti-war movement as being hippies vs The Troops™ when you couldn't throw a rock in most of the radical protest movements of the 1960s and early 1970s without hitting a 'Nam vet. If anything, soldiers were often viewed as the working-class poor bastards who didn't have the connections the wealthy and powerful used to avoid the draft; it had a strong class warfare angle. 
 Because it's a classy and honest way of saying "if this offends you it's more your issue than ours". Abstergo is riddled with them. Looking at you Disney Pepe Le Pew cartoons could never be made today. I saw a video on WWII (at least, I believe it's II) cartoon propaganda.

Bugs Bunny had an episode where Japanese soldiers arrive, Bugs conducts some antics, and near the end of this episode Bugs has the brilliant idea of grabbing an ice cream truck and giving popsicles to the Japanese soldiers.

The popsicles had legit grenades in them, as the cartoon shows. To top it off, Bugs teaches the audience some new racial slurs while delivering the grenade popsicles.

I've never heard anyone call a Japanese person "monkeyface."

P.S. The grenade reveal made me go "WHOAH SHIT MAN IS THIS OKAY?"

EDIT: soldiers Jeez this makes me think of the southerners who are trying to distance themselves politically from some of the founding fathers because they had slaves. Accepting the past is essential for progression in society, pretending it never happened will only cause the negative events to repeat. It's looney tunes bro not looney toons. 

Mandela effect Not to mention the [Censored Eleven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censored_Eleven) that Looney Tunes will never put in anthologies or air on television because they're even *more* racist than usual. 
 As a young black male then I never understood exactly what my mom was talking about then. Now that I'm older, I meow understand  I noticed it as a kid watching Tom & Jerry ca. 1980. I just figured it was depicting a different time, just like all the older TV shows I watched, and just like Archie Bunker's attitudes.

Today we "protect" kids from these depictions because we think they're too stupid to understand. It's sad. haven't watched any since I was a kid, can you give me some examples? This is how many cartoons are. So much just go over their heads, and mine when I was younger. But when you rewatch that stuff with your own kids, it's like damn now I get it, and it's why they continue to be so good not just for kids but adults too. I've got an extensive Tom & Jerry collection digitally. I'm pretty sure it's every episode, I can double check and get back with you if you're interested in somehow obtaining a copy of what I've got.  You can tell it's neat because of the way it is. Time for a neature walk! BRUH! How u doin!  And as for Disney, for some strange reason you can't buy *Song of the South* in the United States. I have my suspicions why. What I like the most about Mafia's disclaimer as well as this one is that they don't simply explain why the content is the way it is.

They also mention how it's important to know that things were and probably still are like that and that it's important to acknowledge that. That's what I find classy. I've actually seen some people that were upset that you can beat the crap out of the Klan in it. I don't hate that it has to be stated, because it's good to have verification that the developers were actually thinking of it when they made the game. 

Edit: well this blew up! Honestly I'm not a smart enough man to properly debate either side of this argument, so I'll leave it to you all. Just...don't be assholes. Put yourselves in the others shoes as best you can. And have a beer or a joint after to mull it all over. Most of all just learn from it. .. whatever IT may end up being You don't know who is going to take it seriously and who will understand its real meaning. You have to put in the disclaimer so it's obvious to an outside observer, regardless of what lunatics play your game and might take cues from it. It's a good thing that they said it, people learn from games even if they aren't meant to be educational. This frames the game within the context of the late 1960s, instead of being a game you interact with, it offers the ability to view it as a window into 1968 and then interact with the world through the character. I don't understand what you mean exactly, but somehow I'm already offended. No, whites are just mere squiggles playing around in an all-black world. r/nocontext Yeah if you'd suggested an alternative that might have been enough. When I was a manager at Gamestop one of our favorite things to do was convince parents not to by their kids Grand Theft Auto when the kids were there. Maybe I'm evil but we loved how the kids lies about its just a driving game would fall apart. I loved reading the rating off the back and watch as the moms face changed. That's so stupid. If you offer an alternative you're still making a sale... sounds like the manager was probably a moron (read middle managment). In the UK you'd have been hired. If they sell a game believing it will be passed on to an underage kid then they can face up to a £5000 fine (key being up to, more likely £200-500 on first time caught). I remember because after turning 18 the first time I got IDed was to buy Saint's Row 4, not alcohol, even though I had been to multiple bars by that point. What game was it? 100% of US presidents right now are black. Total race discrimination against hispanics and whites! You misheard, racism didn't exist before Obama. Thanks Obama... Nope. Thanks, Obama. No it only started with Obama! /s You mean it *started* with Obama. There are people that claim racism wasn't a problem in America *until* Obama was elected. They blame him for making America racist. Seriously. The newest right-wing narrative is that racism STARTED with Obama.  No no no you have it all wrong! Racism *started* with Obama! I remember reading about racism in a social studies course when I was in grade 8 back in 1997. I also remember thinking, it's a good thing we figured this racism stuff out so we won't do it anymore.  Safe space, safe space #BlueLivesMatter The thing is, the reason it was so accurate at predicting the issues we have today is because they had the same issues when West Wing was made. Nothing has changed, issues have just become more prevalent in the media as technology has improved and social media has allowed news and video to spread like wildfire. [the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZAWGuXayLI)

yeah, Sorkin did a great job in 1999 calling what one of many voter's top issues of 2016 would be. This is pre-Patriot Act.  Sam's speech as referenced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaEBXmeaXbI Wait is the PC version capped at 30? Might as well sell the game as a .pptx file "It's fine, the gaming community can only be triggered 24 times a second at most anyways." Dude I was so incredibly triggered hahaha Pretty much why the Assassin's Creed has that disclaimer about religion. I agree completely. These types of statements only inform the player as a secondary objective. It's primary objective is to stop media spin. It might give socially aware players good feelies but that's not it's main purpose as far as i'm concerned. It's a cynical, but realistic attitude to have.

Remember the airport level in CoD:MW2? There was a notification as you started the game allowing you to skip the level. Sure, this meant if you were uncomfortable with slaughtering civilians in an airport you could bail on it. Mostly it meant non-gaming related media couldn't hail it as Call of Duty: Terrorism Simulator 2009 without an instant rebuttal.

Fuck me if cutting down the security check lines in the airport wasn't immensely gratifying though. People are the worst at airports. Anybody that has travelled can sympathise. What do you think trigger warning are for? They're warnings, not bannings. They're not there to avoid topics, but to make sure people are ready for them. Exactly. They wanted to send a message using their game as a medium to depict it, just like street performers, street (and conventional) artists. It has issues at a game level, but morally they've done the right thing in the context of the story and setting.

Reading that statement made me a little bit happier today. Trigger warnings aren't about "covering your eyes/ears".

Trigger warnings are literally to say: "this thing will contain depictions of [insert intense/taboo subject here]". They're to promote the idea that these kinds of things can and should be talked about, but it gives a warning to people who may be negatively affected by it. There are already threads on steam calling this racist against white people and SJW garbage....so they failed, I guess. The game stars a black protagonist, friend. I guarantee that alone has some people calling it SJW garbage.  "The following warning contains content that is aimed at preventing a misunderstanding of our art. In a perfect world, such a warning would not be necessary, we know, but we also know that the world is not perfect, and such a warning will help people that otherwise would be offended to understand our art. By including such a message, we explicitly do not subscribe to the view that depicting racism is supporting racism." It's almost like that's what 99.999% of trigger warnings are, and that 0.001% is a troll on Tumbler that a bunch of redditors got triggered by. Books have had trigger warnings for decades.. They are called forwards!
 
We wrote this book to talk about X time period and the issues around this time. *insert long explanation about events occurring at the time and the leaders, policies, wars, and anything else relevant tot he fictional story"

Now we need this because gamers/media/etc are not informed enough to play the game and understand the themes.
 In two years, when the first signs of the next presidential election cycle start, you'll be saying the same thing.  It's the thought that matters! The key distinction is that those films and shorts were very much unironically racist. You'd have to be a complete idiot to think a game like Mafia III or Bioshock Infinite are endorsing racism.  The Sorceresses were literally pulling all the political strings in that story. They had much more agency than most of the male characters. I don't understand how anybody could decry rather than applaud that fact. Don't forget that the anti-war movement had a significant basis in the ranks as well. It's just so elegantly worded. So great I think it's more about "This game definitely doesn't agree with your religion, but it won't disrespect it either, so chill out, it's just a videogame" Honesty goes a long way It's very succinct and I love that. It's definitely a polite way of saying "we warned you" You definitely worded that better than I did. I heard the Abstergo team recently went from 80% Templar/ 20% undercover Assassins to 80% Assassin / 20% Templar. That's reverse discrimination. (http://imgur.com/TIxKUmY.jpg) Like this bit they cut from Fantasia: http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/9/97/16_cen10-1-.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120529023229 My kids don't even know what Dumbo is.  That movie has been practically erased from public viewing.  Disney has never done anything like that!

That's the truth. It's actual. Eveything is satisfactual.  The WWII ones are so ridiculous. I always found the Siamese Cat song from Lady and the Tramp to be incredibly endearing. It was clear how incredibly racist it was, but from the perspective of an Asian-American who has never had to struggle with anything like that, it was entirely harmless and impossibly catchy. Nor the old Popeye cartoons. Bluto was basically a rapist trying to fuck Olive, and didn't hesitate to use violence and kidnapping to get there. I saw an episode recently and was shocked by how non-subtle it was. Buy more war bonds, damnit! Slap a Jap! We didn't really get the power of marketing and propaganda until around the start of the 20th century as things like radio and television made it possible to reach the masses in ways print could not. The US mostly sat WWI out and our first big war was WWII where we threw everything we had in the effort. There is a lot of twisted material from that war - especially in cartoons. Most of the radio shows I listen to aren't that bad though. They focus on comedy and raising money by selling war bonds and pushing the idea of rationing.  You don't have to like or associate yourself with history to acknowledge it.

Saying Andrew Jackson was a piece of shit doesn't mean I'm pretending he didn't exist. Heh, I was about to post one of the Eleven, [Jungle Jitters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkFhZMa-8Xw).

Even though the times were different, it's really hard to imagine seeing this shit and thinking it's okay. I used to have "All This and Rabbit Stew" in a VHS collection of old cartoons, came in a yellow slip cover. Another one I remember was a Donald Duck war propaganda piece about paying taxes. You know, the sort of shit kids go for. Not so funny meow, is it? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JViBSPCj2jI That's pretty neat! I want to die but other than that I'm okay. Funny. I swear I used to hear that song when I was little and at the Walt Disney World Resorts (1997-2008ish). You can buy bootlegged copies of it at the Joel Chandler Harris museum in Georgia.  But, the thing is, there are many other things that are arguably more racist than SotS and they remain in the movies. The crows from Dumbo, the Siamese Cats from Lady and the Tramp and The Aristocats, the Indians from Peter Pan, and the many racist Mickey Mouse shorts from the 30s. Sometimes they fix their mistakes, like with the black Centaur in Fantasia or the "Cut of your ear" line in Aladdin, but the majority of the time they just leave it in and pretend like it isn't racist. 

I'm not saying they should remove it. I'm saying the opposite, they should leave in the racism, but just acknowledge it for what it is and then don't make the same mistake. And you can't buy *Aladdin* with the first song uncensored. I remember when I was like 16 I thought it would be awesome if Rockstar made a Manhunt 3 set in the south in the 60s where you're a black dude evading and doing all sorts of gnarly stealth-executions on Klansmen and corrupt cops and shit.

Now that this game's been made, I kind of feel like it'd be seen as redundant or a cash-grab, not to mention Manhunt 2 did poorly and the series is dead as a doornail anyway. And the industry has kind of gotten its 80s-2000s obsession with ultraviolence out of its system. Do they need to? If we are playing a game during a certain time period I expect things. 

If the game is rated M they can do what they want without explanation. 

Edit: okay so a lot of you assume that since I said "it's rated M they can do what they want without explanation" you thought I meant "they're going to throw racial slurs and cuss words out for absolutely 0 reason!"

Which I didn't say or even imply. If you're in 1960-70's America I expect a lot of racial TENSION.  Seriously. Most books have authors notes at the beginning to give some insight and direction on their intentions and what they're getting at. Adding context to art is good and helpful when it deals with divisive subjects. I think the reason u/malthuswaswrong has for hating it has more to do with the fact that there are still so many racist people/ideals around these days, just as there are so many people looking for reasons to be upset (the people that can't deduct that it's a real part of our history and to hide it would be insulting to those that lived it/still live it).

Your point is that it's good to know where the developers stand, and I agree in principal.  It's sad that people can't just assume the developers made a conscious decision to include this content because it is a part of history. This. I feel it's important to know people are backing up their ideas of progression through the story they're telling in their games. If you make a game with racism depicted, people are going to call you out, if you make a game that's sheltered snd hides the racism and history of our past, people will call you out. It's good that they're giving a reason why instead of letting the internet stir shit. You're a good man That's a failure of society's education system then, that burden shouldn't be on the developer. It's commendable that they did that, but it's a symptom of a much larger issue. Why are you bringing rugby into this?  I know the All Blacks are an awesome team and all, but they don't have a whole lot to do with this. The white is the only thing that brings focus to the chaos of the black world.   Ooooh...dayum! He did suggest an alternative though.  Tried doing that to my dad once, the guy went into the whole schpeil about the hookers and the murder and my dad just laughed and went "Yep, thats for him."

Love my Dad.  I actually spent a few minutes asking "what kind of games does your son normally play, has he tried this, has he tried that" I put every effort into making them happy but I wasn't about to recommend a game rated M for someone that young. I also said "a lot of kids don't like just any random game off the shelf, maybe you should ask him what other games he likes"... I was this kid growing up. I know what he wants but I was also him years later so I knew what probably wasn't good for him.

This was all a fake scenario though. The next president will be there first white president to an entire generation of Americans. We've had a black president the past 2 terms! Give a white guy a turn already! Half black... He is half white too  The only difference between the west wing and our times today is that everyone has a camera / video recorder in their pocket. Back in 2007/8 I sold my car I had at the time pulled out the binder of CDs I had in it and started going through them. I put on one CD that was a bunch of comendy/stand-up I had downloaded from Kazaa.

I forget which comedian it was (though I believe it was Chris Rock), but the subjects of things he talked about were George Bush being president, the military being in Iraq, and Michael Jackson touching little boys. It eventually dawned on me that the special I was listening to was taped in the early 90s and he was talking about George HW Bush, the Iraq invasion in the 90s, and a completely different round of Michael Jackson molesting children, but the same exact shit was all current news stories. The importance of privacy online was definitely forward thinking. He nailed something that people weren't really talking about in the mainstream at that time. http://www.pcgamer.com/mafia-3-appears-to-be-locked-to-30fps-on-pc/ Yes; supposedly there is a fix coming this weekend "And in this slide, we can see Clay pressing on the gas pedal to get his car up to ramming speed"

"Next slide, please"

"And here, we see his car exploded as it crashed into the side of a building. The target of his attack is nowhere to be seen. It's possible that between these two frames the target dodged the attack and then ran off. We'll never know."

"Next slide.."

 That shit's hilarious to me. Those sensitive reactionaries consider a depiction of the KKK getting mowed down to  be "racist against white people" really overplay their hand. they said the same thing for luke cage....which is a show based in Harlem. Yeah, the Reddit backlash to trigger warnings is blown way out of proportion. It's cutting off the nose to spite the face. Because most were scantily clad, attractive, and sexual. And it's all justified by the need to tell a character's story; they're presenting the game as a work of art. *fist fights the pope* Or just affirming that it wasnt made by "the evil atheists" or whatever to erode X religion values What's weird is Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah is still one of Disney's most iconic songs, but it seems like they've worked *very* hard to make sure nobody knows where it actually came from. I'm 24 now and I didn't even know Song of the South was a thing that existed until I was maybe 19. [An actual Looney Tunes scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8D93Awa434) Disclaimer: The following Disney cartoons are racist as fuck. But they're also hilarious. We will now air them unedited, as we stand to make a royalty fee based on the number of plays. Enjoy! Also the "What makes the Red Man red?" song from Peter Pan. Aaawww, I loved Song of the South, even with all the racism. I laughed. Im a bad person. I still have this on VHS. Never thought of it as racist until the internet & adults told me so. Jesus Christ  Holy fuck. That's bizarre... I have it on BluRay, purchased maybe 4 years ago.

ETA- It's the 70th anniversary edition. Nothing is cut, my oldest thought the pink elephants scene was weird. I haven't seen it, but what is wrong with it? That's sad. The crows are shown in a positive light imo helping dumbo in a way no other characters do in the film. People are too sensitive.  Dumbo was on Netflix at least in Canada. pink elephants on parade!

That said: The crows were the "good guys" in that movie...
 "See the Hun, fire the gun" So much racism there was a buffer overflow at 4:48 and the black guy does a stereotypical 'chinaman' voice  Yes, I'm sure African villages have a "Mammy" archetype. 100% accurate That dog thing's voice is creepy as hell Who are the two people he morphs into? I'm assuming they're celebrities the Queen would find attractive and I don't recognize them. [Is it weird that Mexico still has a character draw in that style?](https://youtu.be/VmT34B0QwRM?t=11) [deleted] That was the world war 2 one right? I used to have it on VHS.  "MORE GUNS! MORE PLANES! Taxes... To bury the Axis."  Excuse me, did you just say meow? How can you tell? Probably because the most well known song from the movie is featured on the splash mountain ride in the theme parks Ziiiiipppppade do da... Ziip-pa-de-ay..  I mean, if I really wanted to find it I could find it. It's still sold in Europe, I believe. Just not in America. Something similar happened with Django Unchained. I think a reporter asked Jamie Foxx what he thought of the use of the n word in the film and he said if it didn't have it it'd be weird. It's shocking that people would get riled up about an accurate depiction of a time period but it happens all the time, and it happens enough that you need to cover your product's butt with a statement like this sometimes to avoid unnecessary backlash  What's the downside of clearly and diplomatically stating your intentions and/or motivations?

edit: wow, 21 responses. This blew up way more than I thought it would. Odd when innocuous statements cause an uproar. [deleted] *doth I think it helps take the content out of the subversive culture element and frame it as a statement.  Didn't Bioshock Infinite get a ton of shit for that one opening scene? I mean an M-rating might mean that to you, but not to critics, it seems Okay, but remember when Battlefield 1 decided not to include female playable characters and there were people in UPROAR over that, even though it was historically correct. So to just assume that people today are going to be fine with historical context is a bit ignorant.  They *can* but it doesn't mean that I don't appreciate a disclaimer like this. >  If we are playing a game during a certain time period I expect things.

Meh, this is wishy-washy. It depends on who the target audience is and what the game's intending to do.

Important questions in creating art are "What are the themes we're presenting? Who are they presenting to? What can add to or detract from these themes?"

Hangar 13 decided they wanted to tackle just how horrifying racism is and present that to an adult audience, so the inclusion works.

However, if this were a kids game, or a game tackling other things, it might be important to rework it. If, as a society, our first instinct were to give people the benefit of the doubt before we got outraged, we'd probably be a less angry as a whole.
 A lot of art is published without such a disclaimer, and whether the message comes across, if the artist(s) intended a direct message, depends on how well the artist understands the audience's capabilities of interpretation.

The general audience is reeeeally dumb. The disclaimer is exactly suitable for a product that is intended for the general audience. Do you think this game is only being played in America? There are probably people across the world who are playing this game that don't have quite as deep an understanding of American culture as the average educated American. They did play against Apartheid-era South Africa when everyone was supposed to be boycotting them.  It was actually a pretty big deal in the 70s and 80s. The All Whites have nothing to do with this either, so I dont even know why I'm bringing them up. But if it weren't for the black masses holding them up, the white figures would disappear The way he did it is bad for a sales job like that. Especially GameStop. GameStop would want the sale so they don't want you to say it's bad.  Added in "I didn't like it and it's rated poorly"

No need to shit on your own store's product. Just say it's rated mature and here's an alternative. But what abcam meant is thzt he over did it and that's what cost him the job. A generation of 8-year-olds. Um, eight years isn't an entire generation. Too bad the only guy running this time around is orange... This whole election has been hilarious. We've got Grandpa Munster (Ted Cruz), an orange guy (Donald Trump), literally father time come alive (Bernie Sanders), and that old lady who won't stop bothering people until she gets "her turn" (Hillary).  Half black people only get 50% police brutality. Also half muslim.*



*According to Fox News Yeah but he looks black. I'm half black, that really doesn't matter to the people who randomly request I evaluate their hip hop music tastes. It's amazing to see how much that changes things. I can't wait to see how our society adapts and learns from it. Now this is trigger inducing! #MakePCGamesGreatAgain Jesus Christ. *suddenly, youtube flooded with gameplay montages in 240...* I CAN KILL KLANSMEN IN THIS GAME? Who in their right mind would get upset over that?!

My favorite depiction of the KKK is in Django.... Hilarious. I think it's more that these people really need to believe that racism is over and the system is biased against white people in order to justify their failures in life. Which is especially odd considering there's literally one major white character in Luke Cage. Which I find hilarious because those people would probably flip their shit if someone forgot to include a Spoiler Alert. Well said, but I wouldn't limit it to reddit. I can attest, anecdotally, that it's spilled over to real life. I've had to repeatedly tell my family that the issue they're objecting to isn't trigger warnings themselves, but the assholes that wildly overreact to the absence of warnings for uncommon triggers. If they seduced their way to the top, it makes sense for them to be scantily clad. Careful, those Christians will issue a fatwa on ur ass real fast for talking like that My mom still won't admit that the "Brier Rabbit and the Tar Baby." Book on tape we have in storage from my childhood collection of Disney books on tape is racist.  Haha I grew up in the south, and my grandma made damn sure to tell me where it was from, all the time. My grandparents are super super racist, it's really embarrassing at times. I love them, and I always will, but they have purposefully and stubbornly held the same beliefs over the course of their entire lives.  They're aware of the world changing, and of why, but they view change as a bad and scary thing. My grandma's favorite movie is Gone With the Wind, which also has deep racist themes throughout. "Look me up at my gettysburg address" is a great line [I've seen worse.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KXqYHKdA94) It's even funnier today than it was when I was a kid. Thanks for reminding me. Racism is hilarious. People need to get over themselves and stop acting so sanctimonious. You can laugh at harmless racist shit and still see discrimination as abhorrent.  
I'm Italian-American, my grandparents immigrated here from Sicily. How many Italian-Americans am I going to be ruthlessly murdering as I play this game? Probably a lot. How many will be fat and have an "Italian-American" accent (because a typical American thinks anyone of Italian descent sounds like they're from New York)? Probably a lot. How many of them are going to be pure murderous pyscopath scumbags? Probably a lot. Am I offended by this? Hell no, I think it's hilarious. I will laugh out loud if I can take a double barreled shotgun and blast Fat Pauly across the table and into a pot of mama's sauce. And all of you will too because it's hilarious and fun and never once will you ever stop to contemplate whether or not its racist, when in reality it's incredibly racist and the next time you meet a real Italian deep down you're going to wonder if he's connected to the Mafia
 Its because it presents slavery as if most plantation owners where benevolent slave masters and that the slaves really enjoyed being subjugated into forced labor. The pink elephant scene isn't weird.  It's terrifying.   The pink elephant scene is fucking weird in all of it's bubbly glory! One of the main crows was named Jim Crow, a name used to reference the stereotypical black man. They also acted like stereotypical black men. [removed] Stereotypical crows and the Roustabouts song and depiction. I believe the trope is called "magic Negro". In which an entity of the black community is invaluable to the protagonists quest, whatever it may be, offering seemingly mystical information that no other character had access to. Just because a stereotype is not explicitly negative does not mean it is not racist or harmful. Canada never counts  They hit metaracism! Voice guy: "So, did you guys have any accent or inflection in mind...?"

Producer: "Just be as racist as possible. We don't care what race, just go all out. We want our money's worth here." [Clark Gable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable) and [Robert Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(actor\)), respectively Lol wow. Apparently, the creator based the character from Cuban children she saw on her travels.  Dear God I didn't watch that specific clip but these sorts of cartoonish stereotypes serve to "other" (used as a verb) non-white people, to make them seem "different" or perhaps "lesser" somehow. 'Look at them, so goofy and strange'. Like a funny animal video or something.

To be very brief: It's not like a cartoon has ever killed anybody or cost them a job, BUT when you are fed these types of messages in all types of media for so long, the idea sticks in your head more and more... Taken to its logical extreme, you get people who subconsciously view non-whites as not quite as human as they are, or perhaps inherently 'goofy and strange', (or violent and stupid, etc etc) and from there it is very easy to act appropriately on those views. Do I look like a cat to you sir? by... the way that it is...? Splash Mountain is entirely themed after the film, which is pretty damn funny If it hadn't been one of the most popular rides at the park, since forever, they would have got rid of it along with all other evidence the movie existed.  It's catchy as hell. They got rid of the movie. But they could not get rid of that song. Yep, it's sold in Europe. On Blu-ray, even. I wonder why the US is excluded. During acting of that movie Leonardo diCaprio stopped for a second and said he felt uncomfortable with all the slurs and Samuel L Jackson said "motherfucker, this is just another Tuesday for us".

 Bioshock Infinite is on the other end of the spectrum– the player is supposed to be taught that the supposed utopia they're exploring is actually this abhorrent place. The player is forced to throw a baseball at an interracial couple to show they're all backwards and racist.

But the weird thing is, the game is set in 1912! The american south of 1912 was way worse than the game world. Nobody in the game uses racial slurs, the violence against black people never seems to exceed the occasional baseball throw, and nobody is disenfranchised.  In retrospect, in the film butts weren't covered and backs were lashed.  Realize, a lot of people are more offend by the *specter* of racism than racism it's self. I think there's an extra level of weirdness with Django Unchained just because it's Tarantino. If you've watched his other stuff you know he has an unexplainable obsession with the n-word.  You risk triggering anti-PC people. Some people just find it a bit silly that we live in a culture where we need to walk on eggshells when discussing racism, to the point where we can't depict real-world racism without first clarifying that we don't actually believe that racist stuff themselves. That is might come off as weird and an afterthought, like the [disclaimer](http://i.imgur.com/LZs9r48.jpg) that Michael Jackson tacked onto Thriller. The point being made is not *they shouldn't* but *they shouldn't need to,* so asking for the downside is missing the point.

Why *did* they put this disclaimer there? The answer's pretty obvious: because if they didn't, a horde of keyboard-warriors would shit on them on the internet. They could have made the exact same game but get a ton of hatred.

I don't think there's anything wrong with the statement and I think the sentiment it expresses is a good one, but the reason - that people take depictions of real-life racism and equate it to endorsement of racism or even *causing* racism without being pandered to is quite depressing. I think it's more a problem with the gaming community in general.  Hollywood doesn't coddle its viewers with warnings like this, and no one thinks that the people who produce movies are racist.

Game devs still feel the need to say "I swear I'm not racist, please don't blow up on me on twitter", and that's the *real* sad part. I suppose nothing, but for me it's a case of 'why do it for the racism, but not the violence?'

The game is 'Mafia'. It's about gangs - gangs were filled with vile people, who did drugs, shot people, used prostitutes, and insulted people because of race, background, disability, and sexuality.

I understand that it's going to be a game about some 'unsavoury' things. 

What it says is, 'murders and sexual objectification/exploitation are par for the course, but sorry about the racism'.

I think that's a little sad... except that No, it got a little shit for that from tiny corners of the internet that reddit likes to get mad at.

But if you search "Bioshock Infinite racism" on google, the first results are *praising* it for tackling racism.

It got a ton of hype for being Bioshock, a lot of praise for being Bioshock, and then a little shit for being boring. I think the questions for this thread are: What motivated them to write and include this disclaimer? and, What did they think might happen if this disclaimer was absent? It's because Mafia III is more product than art.

And I say this as someone who thinks that they've actually gone above and beyond in a lot of areas in regards to storytelling.  To be fair the country itself protested the fuck out of that, and caused a huge commotion. This is getting deep Are they being held up? More like the blacks are being subjugated under the White's superiority.  I've had more then a few gamestop employees talk me out of buying shit games.  They'd rather get you to buy something different then have you just end up returning the game. Being upfront about a product's shortcomings (especially if you have the option to sell a much better product without those shortcomings) is a great way to build trust with a customer, though.  It also reduces the return rate -- omitting or glossing over a problem might close the sale now, but if it comes back in a week all you did was waste everyone's time.   I don't keep up with game journalism as much as I used to. I rely on the surprisingly honest guy at my local gamestop. He's also the one that told me to "stock up on 360 games before the Xbox one gets support for them." he was right. I got Red Dead Redemption for eight bucks instead of the 25 it went for after it was given backwards compatability.  A generation of 0-8 year-olds, 8 years is actually quite a long time. College students right now haven't had a white president since they were in middle school. 8 year olds dude DAE remember Ben 10? Fuck I'm old. Not with that attitude it ain't! Well they say orange is the new black It's hilarious until you realize one of these cartoon characters will be running the country next year. [deleted] 1000% Muslim according to Fox news  I will build a great PC Game -- and nobody builds games better than me, believe me -- and I'll build them very expensively. I will build a great, great game, not capped at 30FPS, and I will make EA pay for that game. Mark my words. [removed] And a cop called me the n word this morning so I shot him in the street!  This game is pretty neat People convinced that "white genocide" is a thing and happening...they're usually also the sort to actually like the KKK (for obvious reasons), and usually the long form of the aforementioned idea is "Jews are controlling the money and media to cause white genocide." And shades was black in the comics. Documentaries on serial killers on late night TV pretty much always have a disturbing content disclaimer and I never see anyone get upset about them. The reason for this is that no one thinks of them as trigger warnings.  >the assholes that wildly overreact to the absence of warnings for uncommon triggers.

That's pretty well put. On that note, I'd be very curious to see the number of people who know the Splash Mountain ride vs the number of people who know it's related to Song of the South. I've heard more than a few people say things to the effect of "who the heck is Brer Rabbit?" in reference to the ride. It's not.  Uncle Remus is an icon and not to be specifically ashamed of.  Not trying to be a dick but to clarify it's "Br'er Rabbit". Br'er is short for brother. That's why pretty much all their names began with "br'er".  I don't think that that particular Bre'r rabbit story is... unless I'm missing something? The tar baby isn't meant to represent a black person, if that's what you are referring to. right here with you. my mom insists "Little Black Sambo" isn't. her reasoning being that it was her favorite story when she was a child. well it's not racist. it's been a part of many many traditional stories. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar-Baby

accusations that SOTS is racist are always really vague and academic. like the idea that a black former slave could be depicted as happy (even though he's no longer a slave). or the idea that a former slave would have a patois and not speak like a Yale Man.
 Actually, "tar baby" (at least, in its legitimate usage) is right alongside "niggardly" in terms of things that sound racist but really aren't. The tar isn't meant to denote blackness, but the fact that it's so sticky. People have definitely used it in [misguided, racist contexts](http://childlit.unl.edu/figures/editorial/big/ephemera.tarbaby.013.jpg), but the proper usage would be to say, like "Libya in 2011 was a tar baby". Well, it's an African and slave folk tale. So I suppose if you say a story by black people about black people is racist then you're right. 

The problem is that this tale is frequently told in a racist context (I.e., told by someone with hatred toward that race) It's not racist. The point of the "tar baby" story is that you shouldn't take the bait on things that don't matter. When Brier Rabbit hits the tar baby, his arm gets stuck in the tar. This symbolizes how a pointless fight sticks to you and gets you dirty, unless you ignore it. Put it on YouTube  "In modern usage, 'tar baby' refers to any "sticky situation" that is only aggravated by additional involvement with it." She's right though. Tar baby is not a racist term, it just sounds like one... I don't know if the fact that your grandma's favorite movie is Gone with the Wind is real solid evidence that she's racist. It's every grandma's favorite movie.  Hey my grandmother's favorite movie is Gone With the Wind, too!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4WoAnty748 > My grandma's favorite movie is Gone With the Wind, which also has deep racist themes throughout.

My mom is Southern and her favorite movie is *Gone with the Wind*. And she isn't racist at all. Just saying. Thats a damn smart joke. Hooooooooly shit. I was more shocked by that than the slave one. Holy shit. What the actual fuck?!? 

Now ive see it all I remember watching that as a kid.. Amazing to see it again in retrospect.. Well... are you with the Mafia?  
 I was working at a tile place that was Italian-run and got cussed out in Italian for driving my boom lift up against a cardboard box in order to reach something. It was one of the funniest exchanges of words I've ever had with someone. I don't speak Italian so when he accused me of crashing into his precious cardboard box in broken English, I came right back at him in the same style of broken English. I was genuinely not trying to be an asshole, I just wanted to make myself understood. I look over and my buddy was rolling on the floor, he said it was the funniest shit he ever heard. Actually it's set in the reconstruction era, so the workers depicted are most likely ex-slave sharecroppers, most likely still working on the same plantation they'd been working on as slaves, but at least able to leave after the workday and theoretically able to earn money for themselves. 

But yeah, most of the criticism is for Uncle Remus fitting the uncle tom and magical negro tropes.

I don't really think it was intended racist propaganda, but it's cringe-inducing because it whitewashes a tumultuous period of black experience and is rather tonedeaf. That scene scarred me. If you get enough of them in one place you might as well call it a murder.  The leader is named Jim Crow. So basically The Matrix movie? There is a key and peele skit for that [Comment deleted because the federal investigation has made me despise technology and it's pretty miserable knowing something like that happened back in 2011 but never getting the slightest bit of clarity to gauge reality moving forward. You can't function this way. I'm too angry at everyone and everything and it's too exhausting not having a way to re-calibrate any sense of what's real. I've gotten really good at faking it but I'm tired of feeling scrutinized by an ordeal that I wasn't allowed to see and I'm tired of scrutinizing others looking for hints. There's no comfort in being able to live your life when you're denied a basic grip on reality because somebody decided that it should all be kept from you. It's like being locked in a soundproofed room of one-way mirrors in the middle of Times Square because you have no idea what the scope of it all was but everybody seems to think they know your backstory now and it ripples into every aspect of life. I can't work. I can't be around people. I'm pissed at everyone and everything because I want to let go of this but I have no way to move on in this state and it's been a 5 year nightmare that won't stop because I've been denied the chance to process it and be done with it. If you could be me for a day you would see that this farce of an existence is cruel and unusual. I've lived through a string of harsh experiences that would destroy some people but I would do it all again for the rest of my life just for one day of partial clarity on what happened back in 2011. I had such a bright future and it feels like it was stolen from me. I just want to know some of what happened. I don't need all the details. I just need some idea of what, how, who and enough information so I can make some sort of sense of it and have peace and have my feet back on the ground. I don't care that I look nuts and somebody out there might think that this is funny...I don't care...this is a nightmare and I need it to stop. I wish somebody else could Vulcan mind-meld with me and experience this so I'd at least have one person who could understand. Even if it was meant to be torture, you'd think one person would throw me a bone and just tell me why so many people are so assuming of me now and know very specific things about me, or rather slightly off version of those things, echoed from person after person. Imagine taking the normal stress of life and multiplying that by every red flag experience where someone seems to be sure that they know all about personal details that you didn't share and it colors every relationship and my own perception and behavior and everything just feels fake and forever contrived and weighed down by this elephant in the room and an entire human life feels like some trivialized media blurb interest story or whatever that happened half a decade ago and despite a lifetime of extraordinary pain, not only do you get turned into a sideshow but it feels like you're the only one who's not in on the joke because they don't think you can handle knowing but they still feel compelled to brief the people in your life who weren't around for the first showing so they 'understand' you more when it really just makes it worse because not only are they underestimating your ability to handle the truth but piling on more humiliation with no direct visibility just makes every day a new reminder that you're broken and everyone thinks you're too weak to know the truth so it never gets better and you're never allowed to close the book.](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/11/11/5-secretive-nsa-code-names-that-sound-like-everyday-things/) Most obvious recent example I can think of is "O Brother, Where Art Thou?." The old black man on the rail cart who represents the blind prophet Tiresias, specifically. Don't forget the part where they help propel whitey to success and never get any recognition or benefit for themselves, often disappearing from the film unceremoniously. In the 80-90s we replaced their role with people practicing voodoo. Or wizards. 

Sometimes even a russian. Something something Steven King. I loved Green Mile.  I watched dumbo all the time growing up.  How the hell was I supposed to know the crows were representative of black people?  They were crows, he was an elephant, and as far as I can remember, the only "people" I remember being shown in any light were awful circus people.  In this case self-censoring is a bit ridiculous.   So this is an honest question, where does Leslie Jones fit? If the New Ghostbusters was animated.. that'd be one hell of a harmful racist stereotype.. wouldn't it? Genuinely curious. Sorry How did anyone ever think that Robert was a better name than Spangler Arlington anyway? Do you see me jumping all nimbly bimbly from tree to tree? http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/animaljam/images/3/34/Cat-fixing-computer-engineer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131016174949 What film? That's the only water ride that I actually enjoy.

I'm a wuss, I know. I think it was blazing saddles that one of the prominent side characters had a tough time saying it at all because he didn't want to say the word to the black star. 

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/trivia?item=tr1439006 I think there's this weird perception that the word itself is abhorrent but it's always context that matters. > "motherfucker, this is just another Tuesday for us".

https://youtu.be/iVzAMmpMra8 Yea, they really... *softballed it*.

It's fine, I was leaving anyway. Lol seriously, the fact that this comment about "I hate that it has to be stated" even came about was ridiculous.

It's a tough issue, addressing it directly is fair from unreasonable or even much to ask. 

And immediately someone here has to turn that into soap-boxing about "our culture" today. Although I don't have a problem with the statement, it's interesting that shows like Mad Men clearly depict racism, sexism and all sorts of isms--and at least from the most part--have never been accused of promoting those beliefs, even though it is glamorized.

For me, it would be great if they felt like the world was in a place where they don't need to write it, but they did and that's fine. They might have thought, 'we don't want people accusing us of being racist' or they could have thought "let's depict racism and show how ugly it is" or both. Don't give much of a shit either way, especially with how clearly it was articulated.  The most triggered group in the world. 

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M NOT ALLOWED TO BE AN ASSHOLE?? HOW DARE YOU. HILLARY FOR PRISON 2016."  I think it's more that we live in a society where lots of people willfully misread intentions to further their socio-political worldview. CD PROJECT RED DOES NOT ENDORSE WITCH CRAFT WE FIND THE PRACTICE ABHORRENT AND BLAH BLAH BLAH Exactly this. If I play this game, I'm not going to come across racist characters and go "wow, the makers of this game sure are racist." Nobody came out of Django Unchained thinking "Leonardo DiCaprio sure loves slavery." I hear you, and I think not being afraid of depicting real-world racism is critically important. But I think it is still important to clarify our own perspectives if we still have some people around who *do* believe that racist stuff. Hanger 13 clearly thinks this is the case, and I agree with them. And yet a pragmatic statement as to their intentions is seemingly receiving some amount of backlash
 Disclaimers like that trigger me Yeah I'm not saying employees will be this way as many will talk real game stuff with you. The company is the issues.  which is the entire point of eb games Generations are normally counted in childbearing age, was the point I was making. ZING! HAVE YOUR UP VOTE

MUSLIM: AS ALL HELL We don't have 60 fps anymore. Look at China, they keep stealing our FPS because we have leaders who don't know what they are doing. If I become president were going to bring our FPS back from Mexico, Japan and China and place American FPS 1st Every time EA complains, we're gonna add 10 more FPS. Congratulations... You've sold at least two copies of that game.

Cheers. Oh that's awesome. Klansmen are like Nazis, you can do whatever you want to them in-game and you *never* have to feel bad about it I was talking about Sharpe, I assumed Shades was meant to be latino in the show.  Though that may just be because of his character in Sons of Anarchy.   Hell, many TV14 rated shows have a "viewer discretion is advised" warning before them. That's why I never got the backlash. It's okay when you're trying to shield the general public from sensitive content, but not trauma victims? Your username is literally the best, thanks. Ha! I'm 34 and have no clue what the hell Song of the South even is. And here I always thought it was Briar Rabbit in reference to the Briar patch. Bruh Rabbit. We pretty much *all* have blind spots for the flaws in the stuff we love. B-but ... the breakfast at Sambo's in Santa Barbara is the best! I would actually argue that SOTS is anti-racist. Sure, it downplays the main issue of slavery, but that's not the point of the story. All you need to know in the film is that these people are treated like an underclass. The story itself is about a guy who doesn't let his situation beat him, who becomes a mentor figure to someone he could easily have felt a grudge against, and who wins the day by simply being irrepressibly good-natured and full of Aesopian wisdom.

If SOTS were racist, I'd have come out disliking Remus when I was watching it as a kid. What kind of a stupid racist film would have the black guy as the most likeable character anyway? Yea it's a sad and frustrating reality that many things are ruined simply by association with assholes, racists, scumbags, and fuckwads.

Pepe is currently experiencing this, with the Clinton administration successfully lobbying to have it listed as a hate symbol, even as the article on it notes that it's not a hate symbol in general, only in specific contexts... It still holds up, and I say that as no one's grandma. But every grandma is racist... so there My favorite band is The Rolling Stones and my favorite album is Sticky Fingers... is that what your username is in reference to? What a coincidence, can't possibly be the same grandma though, right? Unless my grandma has some dark secrets... lol. My exact reaction!  I actually remember seeing it young myself. I didn't quite understand "half-breed" then, but now... I know a couple of guys who know some guys who know a guy, if that's what you're asking me That scene synced up really well with ratatats song seventeen years, chek it out ya'll

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQTbWKE_xyI There aren't enough collective noun related jokes imo Would you be referring to Morpheus or the Oracle? Oh shit, you're right. The Matrix occurs in a fictionalized version of the Amercian North in 2368.

We sought to create an authentic and immersive experience that captures what we think this very turbulent time and place may be, including depictions of the magicalness of various black people.

We find the racist beliefs, languages, and magicks of some of the characters in this game abhorrent, but believe it is vital to include these depictions in order to tell the Matrix's story.

Most importantly, we felt that to not include magical black people would be offensive to the millions of white people in our world who have been assisted by magical black people in fighting our robot overlords.  And you can't say anything, because we're trans!  Ha ha ha ha ha.

- The Wachowski Brothers (probably) I know you're mostly joking, but I don't feel like neither the oracle nor Morpheus really play into any stereotypes.  Anyone else have a different perspective? [Skit here.](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/hzlrwd/key-and-peele-magical-negro-fight) is it the terry skit? cuz that's fucking magic https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film Tommy Johnson is the only musician among them, and tells them about the recording venue That's unfair. Morpheus believed in Neo. *You're* the racists! Agreed.  Hell, I'm 40 and hadn't put 2+2 to most of this until this thread. As a young black kid, I was well aware of it and it also made me uncomfortable. But also as a young black kid, I watched old movies with black people in them and well, that's how they were depicted. Like old Abbot and Costello or listening to old Amos and Andy radio shows. It's pretty obvious when compared to actually living around other black people or just watching shows that came out after the mid 1960s. It's apples and oranges. She presents her public persona under her own agency and has complete responsibility for it, like her or dislike her. The crows in Dumbo were caricatures of blacks, created by whites. 

(Although the crows and Timothy Mouse are the only good-hearted characters in the movie, this stuff is best understood with some historical context, and I certainly wouldn't argue that it is not an offensive depiction on its own.) I don't know who that is, but like I said I tend to believe any racial characature in media is probably not a good thing. Of course there is also the consideration that at the time dumbo was written, black people were *only* represented in a stereotypical way, which is where the biggest harm of stereotypes comes into play. Whereas today we have a better variety of representation in media, so one instance of clichéd racial behaviour at least isn't a part of a broader racial narrative like dumbo was. Am I drinking milk from a saucer?  Song of the South. Context, man. Schindler's List Bambi Any intense water slide is scary the first time you get on, but after the second time youre like "this is fifteen seconds of not very much and i just stood in line for half an hour"

Theres a slide at Hurricane Harbor (in LA) where you stand in a pod and then the floor drops out and youre free falling and I had an opportunity to ride it a bunch without a line when I was there, which of course I took.

Anyways I almost had a panic attack when he shut the door to the pod the first time, but by the *fifth* time I was like "this needs to be higher....where is my family" and wandered off.

Its really not that tall, what the fuck six flags Hurricane Harbor is weak. They stuck it on an old parking lot I think, its tiny. People want the word to disappear as a symbolic way of laying those prejudices and behaviors completely to rest. So people are against its use except in a historical context. And even then, some people still have issue with it. I don't like the word. Having to say it makes me uncomfortable. I know that it is just a sound that my mouth makes and context should mean everything but it just seems so hateful and I don't like saying or hearing it. It's a common feeling too from what I understand. Shouldn't matter but to some people it does. I am definitely against taking it out of historical stuff though.  [white guy talking:] I think it's just a natural extension of the near-universal taboo against white people using the n-word. And I think that's a good thing. The average white person could probably get through their whole life without seeing a time when it's okay for them to say the word (assuming their teacher didn't have them read Huckleberry Finn aloud in class!).

I don't even see that shame as unique to racial slurs -- I knew kids in high school theatre who got uncomfortable when their character had to swear. Same phenomenon: we're taught to associate these words with shame and discomfort, in the same way that we're taught not to show off our dicks in public. Nothing wrong with teaching people to feel shame for doing unacceptable things -- it's literally the way you teach. dude I am with you.  This thread is quickly becoming my favorite example of people just like to be outraged.  

I CANT BELIEVE THEY ARE WARNING US THERE IS RACISM AND THEY ARE SENSITIVE TO IT.  LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE.


We are a bunch of whiny cunts.  I am disappointed in my species as a fucking whole.   I've literally seen people say that black people are predisposed to crime and then get mad when people call them racist. Like holy shit if you say something racist expect to be called on it! It's not even subtle oftentimes now.  he wasn't trying to be an ass...just finds it silly it needs to be stated.

i think the company did very well doing so, but he is right in that it SHOULDN'T need to be said. but alas, not the world we live in apparently. /r/The_Donald is one of the most aggressively PC 'safe spaces' I've encountered on reddit.

The politics that determine the PC aspect being that of the modderators, just to be clear. This is the actual point. The only reason a dev has to do this is to cull reactions from the extreme, vocal, recreationally outraged.  Tell that to the 14 Thai ladyboys he has locked in his basement.  ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY Drake? America is already a pretty great first person shooter.  I swear shows put those in to try and get viewers to be more interested, hoping they'll see some tits or someting.  I never see backlash when the people being discussed are soldiers with PTSD, only when it's rape victims with PTSD.  The feeling is mutual. [deleted] Me too. Oh no not the briar patch. Anywhere but the briar patch.  I get where you're coming from, but you're looking at the story through a modern and distorted lens. I was raised by my Grandmother, who grew up in Georgia during the 30s, and who was in turn raised by her mother who grew up in the late 1800s, who came from a Plantation family.

Stories like Song of the South pushed the southern narrative that Slavery wasn't that bad, that the north was meddling where it didn't belong, and that the slaves actually loved hanging out with the plantation families after the war was over. Everything was great, and there certainly weren't any racial problems. That's just the north pushin' a story to stoke racial tensions. It's why, to this day, you still hear that line from southerners: There ain't a racial problem, northerners/politicians/interlopers are just trying to divide the country for their own gain. It's often referred to as the North winning the war, but the South winning the narrative. My grandmother drilled all of the shit into me while I was growing up, about how our family's slaves stayed around because they loved the family so much. It was even taught in classrooms through the 70s: http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/07/alabama-history-book-slavery

Personally, I'm thankful for the expansion of Black History Month and it's heavy educational focus during the 80s so that I had another view to compare my family's beliefs to while I was growing up. It's all getting a bit absurd when pepe is a hate symbol.

Pepe is only 10 years old.  He wasn't created as anything to do with race.

It's going to be the swastika all over again. Yes Don't forget Link and Dozer! He literally called Link a wizard! > The Wachowski ~~Brothers~~ Sisters

FTFY you horrible person. I guffawed. I tend to agree that they didn't really seem to be stereotype-y. It's the one where Key and Peele are both elderly magic black men trying to help out an average white guy and they end up fighting over him That is the weakest Wiki page I have ever read.
Horribly written, bias and cites 1 person only. Lol. Guy has a huge chip on his shoulder. So basically The Birth of The Dragon movie looks like a parody of this.   Don't forget the white saviour gets some multi-coloured tale on his journey.  Mostly because we forget the main crow's name is Jim Crow. Seriously I have no idea why they decided to do that I had a friend tell me that he didn't like working with black people because they were just naturally lazier than everyone else - he was *shocked* when I told him that was racist. Shook his head sorrowfully and told me "you'll understand some day". 

Needless to say our friendship did not last much longer... My sisters ex often claimed "he wasn't racist" but blacks have extra muscles whites don't and that's why they're better at sports. As if they were anatomically different at that level. Just another subtle bent that they're a different species, he was outwardly racist in other ways that denoted what he really thought but that was his "non racist" statement when watching sports and such. Who won't buy the game or read this message in the first place. > recreationally outraged

That is a fantastic way to put it. He paid good money for their time, they are still on the clock. That's all. YOU LIKE THAT, YOU FUCKING RETARD? drake is 1/3 jewish, 1/3 black, 1/3 pure emotion  I can't tell you how many crappy movies I sat through as a teenager because Showtime told me there was nudity in it, only to see a dude's ass and not a goddamn woman in sight.   [deleted] That about the same time Ted Turner pulled everything Speedy Gonzales?  I'll admit I'm not in the right demographic to comment, but it seems wiping the stories and culture of the slaves away is not a great idea.  It was actually interesting when I researched this a few years ago, it wasn't so much disney hiding it as it was the public demand to hide it.

In the late 80s or early 90s ( don't remember exactly when) they released a remastered version like they do with everything and people flipped out in America because they realized how "racist" it was and due to people's outrage disney pulled it from America.  You can still find it in Europe though.

Another interesting point is that when song of the South was originally released it was actually controversial but praised for how it depicted blacks, since it showed them with a higher level of intelligence then was normally allowed for blacks to have in the cinema at the time.

Funny how time changes things I saw this movie as an adult- you don't have to be a soccer mom to not want your kids to see it without context and a chat. It is *super* racist. At least it wasn't "grand wizard" Actually, now they're just "The Wachowskis", you labelling bastard. Siblings* dumbo came out in the 1940s, they probably just thought it was hilarious.  There is a movie called *You* *Can't* *Take* *it* *With* *You* that also features a crow named Jim, so it wasn't uncommon at the time.  True. But if someone whackjob journalist is able to spark the idea of "Are the Mafia 3 devs racist? Check out these 5 examples of racism in the game", it will be easier to shut it down before it spreads by posting a pic of this disclaimer in the comments section or whatever. No, but they would've heard of it and pretended to be outraged, as they always do, to get attention. Word of mouth can affect sales, regardless of whose mouths they're coming from.

Even close up textures Looks like the black Brian Peppers. r/unexpected Grady? when Samuel photobombs your shoot. This will never not make me laugh. Kimbo lives! Did he turn into Kimbo Slice?! Great chuckle Perfect! laughed so hard Touche to this graphics mod. Took about 4-5 seconds to realize it was in game. I'm impressed.  kimbo slice and samuel jackson had a kid?? Samuel L Jackson? /r/unexpected Was that Kimbo Slice? Perfect timing Kimbo?!  This is the first time I truly wish I could upvote more than once. This one cut right through my defenses. Haven't laughed that uncontrollably for that long in quite some time. And for that, I thank you. Is that.... is that [trash hogan](https://youtu.be/_1jGnFt78H8)? That was too unexpected
 How'd kimbo slice get in there? Reminds me of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blpe_sGnnP4 Huh, looks like you took a pic of a dead hobo. that made me laugh out loud Too much head room. Kimbo Slice was modeled into GTA V? I was waiting for the guy to get overly agressive super easily like everybody else in GTA V Ain't  that Samuel L Jackson !? The ghost of Kimbo Slice watches over the hood. Man this makes the PS3 version look like busted lego The last thing you see before you die. http://i.imgur.com/owkQ4lE.jpg r/unexpected I didn't know Kimbo Slice was in GTA V  I'm just happy its in landscape. I wish that would happen in gta Kimbo!!!!! Do the NPCs not proceed to cap a motherfucker for taking their pictures without asking? What a nice city. Black snake moan... Photobombed Kimbo slice lives!!! Why does the photobombed look like Samuel L. Jackson from A Time to Kill? rip Kimbo classy Exactly like real world photography then.  Omg that picture is the stuff of nightmares... How to photobomb RIP GTA V Kimbo Slice.  it's the ghost of Kimbo Slice. Yo it's the spirit of Kimbo Slice. He showed up in one of my previous posts too. /u/DunkinBagel is reservist career kill? lol  Trash Hulk!
 I thought for sure the player was gonna get hit by a car before he could take the photo, seemed like he backed up slightly into the road. Video games have come such a long way. This is just like real life when I try to take a picture in public. PERFECT The perfect photobomb.  Just like in real life  Fuckin' Grady! Fucking shit A.I, literally unplayable. He has a Roomba. He is ashing on the front porch. There is another set of steps to the left.  Being passive aggressive to the landlord Hes outside on a little porch Asking the important questions. keeping the streets clean is the jam man. Fucking hoarders  to not litter If you buy these Shark Cards we'll give him an ashtray -Rockstar  That's how we roll dog. Not his crib, homie. He's not flicking ash inside. There are clearly no doors open, so that alcove remains outside. Maybe there is an ashtray there. But it looks wrong. Ash is really clean so he's actually cleaning his house doing that!  I don't think you understand what inside and outside is. The door is closed, its all outside What you don't see is the ashtray he has hidden behind that pillar Smokes outside. Flicks Ash inside. Automatic 3 star wanted level. GTAV in a nutshell He cares about the environment because he just dont give a flying puck! Ash can promote weed growth  He doesn't want ash in his aunt Mary's flowers That's the kind of asshole he is. It's a black thing, you wouldn't get it =P he is being nice sir by not causing a grass fire And why is Kimbo Slice photo-bombing it He's virtually doesn't give a guck  He's a video game character. He's not the one that has to clean that shit up. >So i Killed him because I don't like disturbing the cops for nothing

Found the real hero
 I thought he was going to get run over by a car. This was far better. > So i Killed him because I don't like disturbing the cops for nothing

classic Trevor Were you playing as Franklin? Maybe the guy was a racist. Or were you Trevor? Maybe the guy was scared of methed out psychopaths. Or were you playing as Michael? Maybe the guy found it suspicious that fat boy was buying fruit.  We should get that in real life. Like if the cops come, search us, retain us for x time, and we're proven innocent, we can commit a certain crime.

LITTERING TIME ON.

Edit: fuck autocarrot  
>So i Killed him because I don't like disturbing the cops for nothing

George Zimmerman is that you?
 If I hadn't known you were talking about GTAV this would be a very strange thing to read out of context. Yeah no need to have cops shooting him anyway if you can do it yourself. So naturally, I called the 5-0.  You can tell by the way you capitalize words that you're the real deal. My favorite is sprinting into pedestrians to see what happens and how they react.

I once sprinted into a woman, knocked her over. Her hand slapped a police officer's ankle on the way down, and what followed was the most amazingly hilarious case of 'STOP RESISTING!' I have ever witnessed, starting with a shotgun round to the chest. So, would this be a real coincidence, or did the devs put in a photobomb easter egg so this this would happen every once in a while? If it's the same fruit guy that I'm thinking of(just outside of the city), then that is the very first NPC outside of a story mode mission that I killed when I got the game.  > I thougth he was going to shoot you or something. 

also expected this >So i Killed him because I don't like disturbing the cops for nothing
pro tip for life http://i.imgur.com/qeHZtKV.gifv http://i.imgur.com/YVntgwi.gifv I've had it with these motherfucking photobombers in my motherfucking game!  Wow, i didnt know that was a gif, That is waaaay creepier Is this a /r/retiredgif? Now there's a username I haven't seen in a while... How long is the loop Still waiting for the GIF to loop... No matter how I turn my phone, his eyes follow me.  Ah Jackson. I always get inexplicably erect whenever I look at his beard. Wanted to post an image of this, but a gif works better! I felt the same way about the random drug deals in San Andreas. Have you seen the recent facial animation tech star citizen was working on?

https://youtu.be/I2SBYtj9pis?t=1063 Holo decks, rooms, or whatever you should call them... I hope to see those one day I was thinking the same thing.  When I was a teen, games were different colored blocks that you had to pretend were something to worry about. Now we have near-photo-realistic games, and you've got people *in this very thread* saying "GTAV is a piece of shit."  I mean, come on! If you want a reality check on how far animations still have to go play fallout 4 :( 

(I love fallout 4 btw but the animations are... strange)

IVE SEEN PHOTOS I STAY NOIDED IVE SEEN PHOTOS I always think death grips is pretty unknown, until I browse reddit comments  I didn't even know Kimbo died until I saw this comment. Sad day. Yes What's the point of looking for unexpected shit. It won't be unexpected anymore if you find it over at /r/unexpected.  Yeah. Was definitely lining up to be a shitty picture.  Seriously, why else would it have a 3x3 grid overlay?  The one thing I remember from HS photography class. Thank you! I came all the way down here to find this comment. I've seen some footage.

Edit: Ok actually stealing an entire monetized video and turning it into a gif is a pretty scummy thing to do. Hey I saw this for the first time. So I'm glad this guy "stole" this content.  Yeah really. I normally don't care for reposts, but this repost doesn't even give the guy who made the original vid any credit whatsoever. SPREAD EAGLE CROSS THE BLOCK GUILLOTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE  I found the vid and posted it to r/videos. In the comments of the video the guy said that it was a complete accident and he was laughing his ass off. I think you need to get out more, I'm worried about you. Can they only be saved by uploading? If you have a decent PC, search up.

On steam. Fairly good games for the price of free. from Black Snake Moan. It's not even a graphics mod, that's what the standard game graphics looks like on Xbox one, ps4 and PC 

It's pretty impressive That is GTA.  To be fair GTA V's AI is shit in general.

EDIT: And the police have built-in (EDIT 2: laser accurate) aimbots. DJ Roomba is in da house! Something something breaking bad. "I was *not* smoking inside the house."  I laughed a bit too hard at this This is my favorite comment ever [deleted] Well, if they had something better to do that aiding motorists with disabled vehicles then maybe the world would be safer.

Except for that guy /u/mememester killed. He ded. And now he can mass flag videos on YouTube! They could've been out stopping real criminals.  And the real human bean Nah, he's taking cops' jobs away.  Yeah same here. Were you playing as Jermaine? Maybe that mother 'ucker didn't wanna sell an apple to a kiwi.  There was a similar idea to that in /r/WritingPrompts  I'd rather have cash tbh. Can't flim flam the Zim Zam! Police: don't follow that guy 

Zim zam: I think imma just follow him The fucking king of the jungle!  Haha, what is wrong with that cat, his eyes are offset. Scooba?  Wow that's a really long gif.

Sama bin smokin' > I've had it with these monkey-fightin' photobombers in my Monday-ta'-Friday game! How high are you?  It's certainly debatable. And that was just a stepping stone, just like this is. Imagine what it will be like in 10 years! I'm 19 right now. If I don't get holodecks by 50 so I can still actually use them, I'm just giving up Bethesda doesn't count. They're always partially stuck circa 15 years ago. Bethesda just doesn't understand human... Movements. Seriously. Oblivion came out in 2006 with "realistic" facial expressions. They were creepy and heavily disturbing. So in FO3 they didn't do any. In NV, nothing. In Skyrim, stolid as the ice in Dawnguard. Fallout 4 is their first actual attempt at expressions and animations in 9 years! That's more about how far Bethesda has to go as a developer. Nah that's just cause bethesda is still 10 years behind the cutting edge in literally everything besides their level design and (some) quests. I don't think it works like that... you can't say "look how far we've got to go with x" by pointing out one of the worst examples of x. CHARLIE SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN

But for me it's indecent. I would never take something from someone without giving them credit or even pretend it's my own. So why does this practice suddenly become okay just because it's the internet? Yeah, it's not the karme that I'm upset about, it's the fact that someone bothers to download a video, convert it into a gif and posts it without giving credit to the creator. I'VE SEEN FOOTAGE that's gold! :P best timing. Don't have that, either. Just a work laptop and a tablet. Do most everything off my phone. Looks like a PS4 bundle can be had for $275 to $299, so what the hell.  Uh I have it on PC, all on ultra, does not have this cool lighting implying they weren't already bots To be fair the AI has to have aim bots  Well of course they do. You can't really have a bot without aimbot. Especially not a cop. In my opinion the socalled shitty AI is not a flaw, its definitely a feature. You know, the classic shitsngiggles. To be fair, you're shit in general. There is apparently a Police update in the works so we may see some improvements to their AI soon.  Thanks so much for being fair.  To be fair he players have built in aimbots too.  I'm currently designing and programming a game engine from scratch using the same physics engine as GTAV. You have no idea how brilliant and respected the Rockstar dev team is. For a game with this many individual NPCs in a massive map NOT to have notorious lagging issues is a fucking miracle. Yeah cuz if they don't perfectly simulate real life people, they're shit. most people I know play on full aim assist worlds anyways. I'm the weirdo for playing on free aim worlds. Just Cause 3's AI is worse, but it's also hilarious. The citizens say "I love you RICO!!!" while running you over with a car, the military car hits your sport car and think it's my fault, The rebels (they're supposed to be friends with me) also try to drive over my already-crushed sport car and they don't seem to care if I shoot them for that.

I don't remotely disagree, I just thought it was funny that you said it made you sick🙊 Because plagiarism is one of Reddit's highest virtues. *Shoots cop, watches him bleed out as he calls for his mother*

But y-you said they were bots...! Every NPC is a bot except you.  Precisely. When they miss - it's on purpose. The problem is that the police are too accurate in the game, especially when you're driving away from them and they can hit you from a mile away while both parties (the player and the police) are moving.

And mods have decreased their accuracy so it's certainly possible to rectify.

EDIT: idk im just ranting for the sake of it To be fair, I shat on a turtle. Aww thanks, I appreciate the compliment. <3 And you are shit in colonel. :)  I've had this discussion with buddies before, and I swear that Rockstar has slightly buffed the LSPD bit by bit over the last few years with ninja changes. I recall when I started playing at launch; the police were good, but they were nothing like the Robocops you see now after countless mini-buffs. NPC AI seemed less...aggressive, too, back then, but that's beside the point. 

I can't be the only one that thinks this is a completely intentional ploy by Rockstar to troll the players. I may be crazy, but until I see proof otherwise, I'm awfully suspicious of it all. Gerry Gary Larry Lenny Gergich Gengrich I mean, what can I say? I don't know for sure. Did it have a question mark?

No.

Go ahead. Hi, How are you?* Per NPC... This pack adds all new NPCs with multiple outfits and actions! 

New actions: 
-alleyway heroin overdose 
This action causes a Homeless NPC to do heroin in an alley then consequently seize and die. Corpse drops minimal cash.

-Domestic dispute
This action causes an NPC couple to engage in a fist fight on private property. Often visible through window, or over gated fence.

Privileged abuse- Rich NPC couples will randomly begin screaming before one partner knocks out the other with a single punch. All surrounding NPC will avert their gaze. Beaten partner drops high value cash amount.

New NPC:

It- Melee weapon wielding clown that will appear at random and chase you in a smart car or on foot. Uses tiny cream pies instead of police stars to determine strength of weapon.

Male Hookers- multiple skimpy outfits. Will fight instead of run away from you if you get violent. Uses fists until you pull a gun, then they pull the game's largest side arm from their thong.

Try Some ME- Wears shirt with "Try Some ME" printed front and back. Advertises for company called "Multimedia Everywhere". only appears DOWN town. Attempts to hug character. Extreme strength when violent and aggravated. Can throw you across street. *Make virtual friends!* Too Soon >  the life expectancy for ~~anyone born today~~ [basically white people](http://www.businessinsider.com/huge-racial-gap-in-life-expectancy-2014-1)

It's a figure of speech, tomatoaway. They're bureaucrats, I don't respect them! As always, [relevant](https://xkcd.com/873/) They did in GTA4. "Tell my wife I loved her!" While they crawled away holding their open wounds. I made a crappy Terminator movie in GTA a while back I was impressed with the recording when I was playing with it I noticed a cop grab his buddy who was shot and pull him out of danger and then coming for me himself.  I feel good for getting this reference. NPC = Non-player character/Non-playable character

You can't play an NPC TIL IAMA NPC In soviet Russia you are the bot  My whole life has been a lie... Not necessarily.  I mean yeah the programmer could make bullet behavior act however they want, but assuming the system is built using real AI or pseudo-AI, or that bullets behave like actual physics bullet simulations... then someone does have to put in effort to code an "AI" that is capable of having perfect aim and prediction.

I don't think you're wrong at all, by the way.  I think for most games, this is a mostly-solved problem.

I just didn't want someone else to come by the post and think every enemy bot in every game is capable of perfect play.  They're not. Really? There's no usage of RNG to mimic an accuracy level below 100%? It's just "I want to hit" or "I want to miss"? They're expert marksman because of all the crime. Its funny when you go flying from an explosion and get wasted, you can see the cops rounds still hitting you in mid air.  This game is made more for Lock players. 
Max Payne 3 New York Minute foes weren't even that accurate, and that game was made for whatever aim choice you decided. (Free for me) 

Now, GTA IV firefights were the shit. 
If we could keep everything we have here and just take the aiming back to IV for players and NPC alike, I think it'd make that game that much better. 

If you went into a firefight even with a sliver of hell, you could possibly make it out, assuming you take it slow. 
Same scenario for GTA V, you're gonna get rekd because they're gonna lock onto your hand while blind firing and lock onto your head from behind a car. 

Which, why is cover behind a car a thing if the top of your skull can still get dumped on?

The fuckery of it all.  I really don't have an issue with them anymore. It was a tough transition from 4 to 5, but they can be pretty harmless with practice.  To be fair, I found it arousing. Uhh, no thats not how this works.... I assume you are talking about the PC version. Is it the same for consoles or are they still less aggressive on that platform? Gerry's one of my favourite characters.  From his amazing painting skills, to his beautiful daughters and smoking hot wife, to his phenomenally large penis.

And also in the first season where him and Ron were actually friends and went hunting together, seems weird looking back on it now. Or:

>Why would you say that? You must think I'm an idiot.  Is it reddit or interview with a politician?

I don't know, I'm not a scientist. SIR, I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I AM NOT A QUESTION PERSON, YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME SO I'M GOING TO HANG UP Me too thanks Yeah, you too!  Methadone. That's *how* I'm high.

Edit: Methadone is a hell of a drug. Calm down there EA Per Limb Fuck, the heroin OD animation might make it worth that price on its own. Bags rock nothing to clean or return You guys have bag milk? Jealous! >Very ~~Canadian~~ Ontarian thing to say.

I've lived in 2 provinces, visited nearly every province and the only place I've seen milk in bags is Ontario. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here! Not with that attitude! I'm not playin' around when I take Franklin to da strip club You can't play a playa either, son.  We are all NPC's on this blessed day Anne* an NPC That's irrelevant - you can't play a bot either. AMA Game developer here.  

You're right when it comes to games that have actual bullet physics such as bullet drop and time to travel.  But if it's hitscan (or fast enough at short enough ranges that it's *basically* hitscan anyway) the opposite is true. I'm going to address those situations.

*Sidenote; I'm not calling you wrong or anything, I just really like talking about these things and wanted to throw in my two cents*

It's actually substantially easier to make AI ungodly powerful than it is to make them realistic.  In fact, it's almost easier to make them too useful than it is to make them entirely useless (the obvious exception being "make them do nothing").

When it comes to shooting, simple maths can be done to make them aim perfectly at you.  You have to *add extra steps* to make them inaccurate.  And even then you have the struggle of getting their imperfection perfect - are they too useless? Still too powerful? Is it realistic? Is it fun?

Then, not related to the aim thing but still related to bots unfair advantages, there's the fact that the AI are the computer.  The computer knows everything you're doing, always.  We have to explicitly hide this from the AI.  It's very easy to make them always know where you are, because they do that by default. Implementing the ability to hide from them without making them absolutely idiotic is actually quite an accomplishment.

Personally, I'm quite impressed by GTA V's cops. However, that's not necessarily from a gameplay perspective - I'm impressed more in their actual functionality than I am in their realism or gameplay. Early days in GTAV there was no point in running, the cops would find you. You learn the city, learn their tactics, learn when to run or when to fight. Sometimes when to fight just enough to run. Redux has taken it back to high levels of extreme challenge for me. So when NATO forces cant hit me in Arma 3 its not because im a good cyber soldier but because they're missing on purpose? T_T I can guarantee you that if ai is done right aka given the data on where player is and accuracy is not dumbed down, they will hit each shot perfectly before you even have time to react.


You caneasilytest this in game like counter-strike. Load up game with expert level bots and watch them turn 180 and headshot you on first hit. I'm not making games, but even if there is - you need a vector of shooting such sequence. There is no point in computer tricking itself. I'd guess they have several patterns of how bullets will fly for each weapon, like in CS 1.6 pro players always know where the first bullet of AK will fly relative to crosshair so they can score the headshot.
But that's mostly my guessing not supported by practice. Practice makes perfect. See, you say that, but I don't know how the LSPD would be able to find anyone but the greenest of newbies to join the force after the entire police department has been brutally murdered at least a million times over. 

I sure as hell wouldn't want a job in Los Santos, though, despite the constant need for new meat--just gonna put that out there. PULL! To be fair, in reality, cars aren't very good shields from bullets. Unless you're behind the motor block or such, bullets go right through glass and sheet metal. Hiding behind a car door in a gun fight is TV magic. Max Payne 3 has such a good aiming system especially with the ai not having god tier aim. That's not how any of this works! Oh, no. Haha. I started on 360 back at launch and upgraded to PS4 when that released. I don't know of any differences in AI between the PC and console versions, though. 

Cops are just aggressive dicks any way you look at it. 

I just wanna massacre the city in peace, officers, I swear I wasn't actually gonna use the minigun, though. I was just showing it to that gaudy, NPC hipster who flicked me off as I was doing a 3 minute burnout in my 2.5 million dollar supercar while whipping shitties. 

So, yeah. I can't see why they're so aggressive. iirc, they go hunting (or camping, or whatever) together a few more times, as well.  Ron actually doesn't seem to hate on Gerry like the others.  It's rare to see him ACTUALLY making fun of Gerry.  Usually he's just in the background looking grumpy.  It could be because Gerry is a HUGE piece of rebar stuck in the governmental cogs. What's all this? You're trying to get him Karma. "Does your office have any device that can be in any sense considered to have been called, at any point in time, a machine that makes copies!?"

I have no idea what prison is like here! Driver San Francisco says hi Not with ANY attitude! As soon as you play as an NPC, it actually becomes a PC. It's like getting to the highest number you know to try and get to infinity; and then realizing you can still add one. I hope GTA 6 is in Vice City  Dolt! ROFL Would genetic evolution be helpful in making AI by having them play against players until they reach specific kill/death ratios and penalizing overachievers meant for lower difficulty? >Implementing the ability to hide from them without making them absolutely idiotic is actually quite an accomplishment.

The enemies in MGS5 do this really well. It's always surprisingly hard to stealth away from them when they know you're there and are looking for you. Good, useful, informative post.  Good read. I swear, the more complicated the shot, the more likely Arma AI is to successfully make it. I've been killed in such stupid ways from range, but up close I've lived through some crazy encounters. so the AI in counterstrike is just like a 13 year old that fucked my mom? Playing Veteran bots in Black Ops works like that. They know your next move before you do. now one way around that is using projectile weapons, or having the bullets actually travel. Then the ai must lead shots to be accurate over distances, and up close would be deadlier. It's all contextual.  In this world that is just a tuesday.  I mean think of how bad it is just being an innocent pedestrian, you see random fights break out all the time over nothing.  At least the cops get issued weapons.  Imagine being the poor hot dog stand guy. > brutally murdered at least a million times over

Who cares, they get revived at the hospital anyway.  Or the hospitals are just really good and the cops have access to the same voodoo resurrection technology they use on your character, and you're actually fighting with the same cops every time. [deleted] It's good to be the king. LMAO hahah I got it on PS3 with the 1 Mil Shark dollars bundle
I honestly need to play that game
Many people are probably on God Level Online and I am still on the Trevor Missions right at the beggining. I am disgrace to modern gamers :/

Edit: I have the PS4 now, I might get the PS4 version if there is like a special sale That is true.  I do recall one time Gerry was talking about his daughters, losing his virginity, and starting an abstinence programme and Ron just looked incredibly bored, but he didn't actually make fun of him for it.

Also Gerry's been putting up with the teasing and bullying for years, but he's still pretty positive.  He just wants to go home and be with his family and spend his retirement painting, reading, and smoking cigars.  He's got thick skin, if no practical skills, and Ron could probably respect that. Thry are big and you have to wash them before they get thrown out! That's also the standard here in the UK, although some people still get glass bottled milk from the milk man.  Same with the usa but I still prefer bags Remember that ad yearss ago where the guy walked in to the milk bar and asked for a bottle of milk and the lady listed them all? I know the guy. He was my drama teacher years 7-10 in highschool. He was a great bloke. But if you didnt do your homework... well he was very drama-like about it. Or Bot City I really hope they do this, and document the whole thing. It would be fascinating to watch. Maybe they could face virtual use of force boards and get virtual discipline for using too much force. They might even get virtual suspensions or virtually fired. Later, after the AI's AI wife leaves him and his AI kids won't return his virtual calls anymore, the AI might even eat his virtual gun.  No, don't judge perfection. There is always a chance of computer error which 13 year old fuckers don't allow. Projectile or hit scan. Making a bot with perfect aim is easy.  It's making one that is believable bad is the hard part. I don't think having bullets that travel would be a good idea. The tick rate would become a serious issue for projectiles traveling that fast due to performance bottlenecks. It's the reason why hitscan was created in the first place. Fights over NOTHING? Oh, hell naw. When someone cuts me off when I'm speeding at 130 MPH down a busy street, I take offense to that. Haha. 

Aside from that, you do have a point. I've thought about just how insane it would be if Los Santos was somehow, inexplicably real. You put it as "random fights", but I think that doesn't really do justice to the absolute level of chaos and violence that city fosters. I mean, let's be real, at this point in the game, any given lobby is a collection of fighter jets, APCs, attack helicopters, mercenaries, MANPADs, chrome supercars that perpetually spawn flying sticky bombs from their interiors, etc.. 

The game is full of damn lunatics--each one probably worse than anything most of the real world has seen.  I would recommend you play it on PS4 if it all possible, especially if you intend to play online. Now, it probably is the best idea if you make a character on PS3, and then transfer it to the current gen. I'm pretty sure Rockstar still offers some bonuses for doing that. Certain cars will be free for you or available for purchase, and some special weapons at Ammu-nation will be available (notably the .50 handgun. I mean, come on, that thing is sweet). 

Whatever you do, first get through the story! I thought it was the most entertaining story mode in a GTA game--largely due to the awesome heists that you run through. I know some may disagree, but no matter how it fits into the overall rankings, it is a pretty fun story to play. >That is true.  I do recall one time Gerry was talking about his daughters, losing his virginity, and starting an abstinence programme and Ron just looked incredibly bored, but he didn't actually make fun of him for it.

He was more annoyed because Gerry was talking about all this while they were trying to fish. Which is clearly unacceptable. I'm doing a binge watch of the whole series and just watched this episode. 
 Hey there, casual American here. I've never, in 22 years of existence, washed a milk jug out before disposing of it... 

It's been emptied of a vast majority of its milk, I don't see the need to run up the water bill catching the last 1/64th of milk still clinging to its plastic sides.

Could you, if you've the time, explain why you (and I assume your culture) wash your milk containers before disposing of them? I understand if you're returning them, but if they're going in the bin they have to be washed too? [Ahh the milkman, we have a lovely old bloke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-knOGoRYhE0) or GoT City Why are they fucking 13 year olds?  well that's what battlefield does but you definitely notice the low tickrate and laggy bullet physics 

i have a p strong feeling most implementations of npc aiming in modern games don't use the same bullets as the player weapon firing code because there's no need to put as much detail into them. use a special set of logic to determine if the player is being damaged by npcs firing on them rather than simulating it in its entirety Nothing Batman can't handle. Just kidding, even Batman went passive mode. American. I recycle, and our facility won't take them unless they're rinsed. Food draws bugs and animals, plus just smells gross when it'll be sitting in a community bin. One of the best features of any handheld Nintendo know that the gameplay is the only advert the game needs. This is why I absolutely love Mario Party DS.  Sure the boards are somewhat meh but the fact that you can do a full 4-player run with just one copy is so awesome. And then there's the guy who only picks Bowser for Rainbow road just so he can knock your flimsy ass into the abyss with a glance. Now if only I could make more than 7 friends... The mini map on the bottom screen my favorite feature. I abused the hell out of that thing, you could see what items people had.

After hours of playing and getting very comfortable with the maps, I found myself watching the bottom screen more and only glancing at the top screen every now and then. I miss my Advanced Wars for the GBA Out of my 7 friends? Wow so optimistic! Just got a 2DS this game came worth it for free Still doesn't make up for them getting rid of Waluigi. Unforgivable. Meanwhile, it took 15 minutes for my PSP to share a Burnout demo with my friend. The original DS version was like this except the other player without the copy gets a limited amount of cups they can play and they were forced to play as a shyguy. But still pretty cool of them to let others try local multiplayer. The only draw back is people without the game have to play as Shy guy, but it's not that big of a deal. Mario kart for the ds lite did this too, i remember i went to like a summer camp, we all had ds's and i was like "get on my download play  homies" its was great :D Who the fuck has 7 friends?  Yeah, but they can only drive as Shyguy in the standard cart. Making it almost impossible to win, especially playing against someone who has everything and plays the game regularly. I hope the NX is really good and they don't charge for online on it. As a PC gamer who started out on Nintendo I would love to buy it simply to support them and play the amazing exclusives they put out. Same thing with the original Mario Kart DS in 2005 or 6.  Starcraft and Warcraft were similar. Don't own the game? No problem, Install a special spawn copy and you can still join multiplayer games.
 If by "mariokart" you mean "every Mario DS game"  7 friends!? Check out Mr. Showoff over here. That was freaking awesome, not gonna lie.

The GBA version had similar features, but I think you were limited in the stuff you could play in multi unless everyone had a copy. Anyone remembers?

or maybe it was on the DS. Man, I'm old and drunk. So many good memories <3 Who has seven friends?  PSP also had this feature, though it wasn't often used. Very underrated system. How does one do this? Such a shame that this move lead to a massive lack of sales and tanked the franchise. 

Wait, no...  >Implying this was an exclusive feature to Mario Kart 7. This was on Mario kart before 3DS The DS download play feature was a feature that REALLY made the DS a viable gaming platform. Mobile gaming is usually so iffy because unlike a console, all your friends need to own the same game. Not so with the DS. Download play was the shit Yeah!... now if only I had friends. Me and four of my friends played MK7 at lunch (I'm in high school) last week, and we had an absolute blast (which was our largest game to date, normally it's just me and two friends), and even though only I have a (digital) copy of the game, we were all able to play, albeit with longer load times then if we all had the game.
 I often feel that Download Play is the most underrated feature of the whole DS/3DS family, I've had loads of fun with friends and family in the past not only with MK7, but also Mario Kart DS, Mario Party DS, Super Mario 64 DS, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon (which is what I'm currently playing through, absolutely love it) etc. etc. . The most memorable moments I remember with D.P. are with my brother and three of our cousins, we stayed up until 3 or 4 am playing Mario Kart DS & just having an absolute riot. I just wish more games had support for Download Play. :/ The amount of Shy Guys is insane And it has great maps to battle on, including some classics, unlike Mario Kart for the Wii U (biggest disappointment ever for me)

Edit: Sorry, was thinking Mario Kart for DS. I haven't actually played the 3DS version. This reminds me of a time where back in middle school all the kids had a DS or DS lite and when ever we'd be on a field trip who ever that one kid was that carried the game with him all the time booted it up and had I believe 6 people playing in a single game and every one was yelling at eachother on the bus because of the game. Played it towards to the destination, and back to school. Because we had such a blast with it together.

Kinda a shame that not all handheld games do this :/ 

Man good times.  I remember there was a naruto game on psp that did this too... Well, 1v1. I spent way to many woodshop classes fighting a friend. I guess generosity runs in the Mario Kart genes. Mario Kart 8's suddenly and without warning giving my family a free full price game (we got Wind Waker HD) is the nicest thing any video game has ever done for me. Plus it's the best game I've played in years too. Lmao like I have 7 friends I have great memories of playing this in high school. I always sat with the "gamer nerds", but over my four years, it really became something great. Before long, we always had a group of at least 10 people, and it would cap out at up to 20, turning lunch into what was basically a mini LAN party. We'd all bring our handhelds, and take turns sharing multiplayer games. MK3DS was a really popular one, and so was Kid Icarus:Uprising, plus virtually any multiplayer we could get our hands on. It was really great, and it brought a lot of joy to the lives of kids who would never have friends otherwise.

I'm never gonna forget that. Someone correct if I'm wrong but Paradox let's you do something similar with EU 4 and CK 2 - In multiplayer, you have access to all DLC content that other player's have even if you don't own any yourself. Considering some of the DLCs give you some pretty powerful options, I think it's a good system. No Waluigi though... I thought DS only had 4 of the cups. Also shyguys only except for the host.  Just like for the regular ds version.  This was how it was for the original mario kart ds as well. This brings back memories of when I had bomberman DS and 6 other kids had DS's in high school.

Lunch time was the best time. Video games were life. Still are. To a lesser extent, Metroid Prime Hunters had this, although it did limit play, but was still a nice feature! I remember playing this at the bus. We always had huge tournaments of our own and there was screaming and excitement everytime.

God, I miss those days. Now I can't even play with a friend of mine without Wifi or having to wait 2-3 minutes until one of their phones finally pops up on Bluetooth, only for then not have it work.

This game holds a really dear place in my heart. This was the best on field trips car rides. Wow, 7 friends.  Look at Mr. popular over here. Nintendo seems to be screwing up a lot by not moving forward, but lets just take a minute to commend Nintendo for not modernizing and letting us do this. Nintendo still really cares about us It's not a bad sales tactic. Instead of convincing 6 people to buy a $50 game, they only need to convince 1 person to buy a $300 handheld. And plenty will still buy the game over the excitement of playing easily with friends who don't or can't. I can' tell how often this saved me and my family. My 3 little cousins had all 3DS but only me had the game and we could play.      
Sometimes 1 - 2 of them forgot their game or can't find it and we still can play together. Great feature.  Download play is such a great feature. I remember playing Mario Kart DS with my little brother back in the day.  Sweet now I just need 7 friends! The DS one also allowed this and it made for great bus rides and lunches in high school.  ) The old first generations had this as well. We would play on the bus ride from school.  [deleted] Back then my cousin and I would split a copy of WWE on PSP, we would swap it back and forth and the PSP would preload some of the data and every time it froze we just swap it over i remember my first year in college getting high with my roommates and playing this all night long. Mushroom Cup, Shy Guy only, no items. DS download play. Never forget. Ahh this is what I really loved about Gamecube. Those 4 player games. Plug in all 4 joysticks and ready to play. I used to own Mario Kart on Gamecube and man me and my family used to play that game for fucking hours. Also had Super Smash Bros. Those were the days.  Advance Wars games are even better. One game, one console, pass it around in 4 player mode.


Are there any other good handhelds with that feature? Makes sense, no one buys 4 monopoly boards to play together  I always thought it was silly for multiplayer to require its own copy of the game for each player. When I was younger there was one console, one copy of the game and I only needed my own controller. Now I need the whole console and a copy of the game for handheld gaming. It makes it almost impossible to find people to play with. I knew about ten people who had a 3DS and probably 8 of them were 12 or under. Most kids just have games from their favorite movies anyway. 

The only thing that makes sense to have a copy for each player is games that are solo focused with multiplayer fighting or trading like Pokémon and Megaman Battle Network.  one of the only good memories i have from middle school. 


the school bus would drop us off an hour before school, and the school wouldnt open it's doors for 40 mins. so all the kids that took the school buss would wait outside. when this game came out and someone had the bright idea to bring it to school. he  instantly became popular. a week later there was 3-5 groups of 8 playing the game while waiting for school to start.  Hoping this is a feature for some NX games if it does turn out to be a mobile/console hybrid :D In middle school, we got DS's band from the premises because everyone would be playing Mario Kart and Pictochat during class. Was still worth it.  7 friends. hah I just bought a 3DS XL last week, along with a few games (including Mario Kart 7). I didn't realise you could play multiplayer with other people even if they don't have the game! Really good to know, maybe I'll get my girlfriend a 3DS and we can play Mario Kart together :) If 1 of 8 own it... how do all 8 play for free? :( Unless you don't have 7 friends. That game makes me super aggressive for some reason  The original on the DS was absolutely the best. My siblings all got a DS at some point and we would play this so much. I love that game.  never forget, diablo 1's "spawn" install... which was basically the completely free multiplayer client. PICTOCHAT WAS THE REAL SHIT Shy guys for everyone. I used to sit in the gym before school started and see if I could find other people willing to loose. Same for Mario 64. In Middle School when someone in our group forgot to bring Pokemon, one of my friends would get out Mario 64 for DS and we'd have a blast in multiplayer. Sweet meme brah And you get a kart! And YOU get a kart! And *you* get a kart! Never forget, $75 in 1997 for FIFA 64 at Toys-R-Us good guy nintendo in general.. Oh so like exactly what every Xbox one fan DIDN'T want in their console?? Game sharing was a real idea they had for the first Xbox one and everyone was up in arms about not being able to sell used games! I hate those people > good guy mario kart

the same game that 5 years after release is still $70 
 I wish more games had features like this, but I guess they lose money on it  So many 3 hour van rides for indoor drum line. So many laps of Mario Kart.

You were the real MVP, Sam. I remember the days of elementary school playing CoD4 on the school bus when only 1 kid had it. OG multiplayer Local multiplayer analogue? I remember back in the original DS years, each year there would be fewer and fewer games you could do this with.

Even games in the same series would cut out single-card play. Fuck yeah Mario kart ! Man college days of fighting it out with 8 friends in between classes. Good time.  It makes it sound like I only have 7 friends. I have 8. Because the 3DS has a limited amount of RAM dedicated to download play.

If it can fit in that smol limited window, you can download play any title ever. Well, time to round up my buddies[.](http://tylg.deviantart.com/art/Marea-Kert-635994543) yeah but you get no music.

and are forced to play as shyguys with the default kart :( That feature didn't work if you had a 3DS from different region though. :( IIRC, this is how it goes for all local Nintendo handheld games. Ah the memories, my second Mario kart game. 7 friends? Ah yes fuck it, the great bussiness model of the past 4 or 6 years. Knock Knock!
Who's there?

Luigi who?
THE STORY OF MY LIIIIIFE
 Never knew this.  Nintendo is awesome.  This made my graduation so much better.  Instead of 3 hours worth of talking we had one giant tournament between 16 people. Do other ds games still have this feature? Mario Kart was the one good title I was aware had it. Many people don't know that Starcraft 2 has the same feature.

Only one guys has the game? No problem, play all team games together if you are together in a group.

Even if you don't own the game you can play the whole Arcade for free solo. They were betting we didn't have friends. Mario Kart DS was the main attraction after Sunday school! Great buisness model.  I never actually bought this game but me and everyone else on the bus in 7th grade played the shit out of it because one person happened to own it. Last year, my sister came to visit me (and my ex) for the weekend and she brought her 3DS. My ex at the time had a 3DS and I had a 2DS. We all decided that we wanted to get a game from GameStop to play together. Big ups to that employee who told us about this little gem. Saved us some $$ for sure. I ended up buying the one copy we got. Nintendo is like an antonym for Electronic Arts. THAT SHIT WAS THE BEST ON AIRPLANES.
Would share it with all the kids and have big mario kart tournaments.
I remember a kid stuck in first class with his parents thanking us for helping him, apparently his parents had just got a divorce and he was flying to live with his dad who had flown him first class. It was his second flight ever and he was still afraid of flying.

(not sure why both mom and dad were on the plane with him, but you could feel the tension) One of the moments I'll never forget when i was a kid was after soccer games, all the families would go out to eat together and all my teammates would bring their DS's and we'd play Mario Cart DS the whole time I love the feature, but sometimes I don't wanna play shy guy, ya know? But you know you have some real friends when they all play shy guy too so it's fair. Yeah!! couple of other games did this but i don't know of any that were 8 player and did it.

one of the legend of zelda games had co-op and only 1 person needed the game for example. Don't Mario Kart games punish people for winning? Like Blue Shells and stuff? monster hunter let us do this as well :D Starcraft 2 does this too 👌 Same for Mario party To compromise for them never undergoing price drops. He'll that game is still probably $40  This will be missed... Back in high school a couple of friends and myself had Mario Kart on our old brick DS', so we started playing in a room at lunch one day. 

After a few days of this some other people with DS, but no game noticed, and it wasn't long before we were having 8-person races every day at lunch. Eventually some people playing were making a racket during our games, so they made us move outside to play video games, which led to the group Mario Kart days dying off since nobody wanted to deal with the glare outside on the old brick DS.

Good times. Do I have to be the one to ask? What the hell is a booty bun?! Oh god, that game was a nightmare in multiplayer thanks to the "Snaking" exploit where you effectively could get infinite drift-boosts. Tell this to Pokemon:
https://tcrf.net/Talk:Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen#Removal_of_.22Anti-piracy_message.22 I remember playing Mario Kart DS on the bus after school with my friends. good times. I remember bomberman having this feature too! 
DS few indeed Friends? What's that? ._.  That's God. I really don't know if I should get a 3DS now or if I should just wait for the NX.  Ahh I remember this late night Canadian suburb sleep overs with our wiis and 3ds. Also YEAHH FREE 3DS GAMES Want to be able to play Vs in singleplayer?

Well fuck off, you can't do that here. You can do this with PS4 too, at least with some games.  I know for sure I've done this with LBP with my BIL over the internet. Everyone still needs the system I always keep a copy in my traveling case, It's definitely come in handy a few times. Things were simpler back then Owned a PSP back in that time. I wanted to play some Medal of Honor with my 4 friends, but the game didn't support the game-sharing option, so I got a bit creative here: Started the game on my PSP, started an Ad-Hoc-server and loaded into the game. Took out the UMD gave it to the next friend. He would join in and ejected the UMD as well etc.
Worked pretty fine until the round ended. It's a system that makes sense. You only need one copy of double dash to play with 4 people, the only condition is you buy the additional controllers. If you think of owning additional handhelds like owning additional controllers, you start to wonder why this isn't pretty standard. *if you all own a 3/2DS That's a really good thing a company can do, even coming from one like nintendo. Same thing with Tekken 5 on PSP, requires one copy of game to share between friends.  Mario Kart Wii was the best Mario Kart.

Too bad those fuckers took down the wi-fi for it This game is my least favorite in the franchise...and yet it's still bloody amazing Ah yes, back when video games were made to have fun, and not bleed the users dry with microtransactions and DLC Now if only they'd nerf those blue shells to be like they were in Mario Kart 64 It was fun but they ruined balloon battle. Changing it to timed instead of stock. I was quite upset. Xbox One was gonna have this for all games, but the internet bitched so much about always online requirements, the feature was scrapped.  Am I missing something? We were always stuck to using Shy Guy when playing locally. Welcome to marrrriioooo kaaaaaaaaaaaart. At my daycare, we all had a DS, but only one kid had Mario Kart. He was awesome.  You say good guy but in truth he's just waiting for blue shells to be thrown and friendships to end. The game is called Mario Kart 7...

It shows in this very picture, come on OP! Wow, I knew it was similar with the regular DS, but didn't know they kept it and added more with the 3ds version. Good guy nintendo. Never forget Good Guy Starcraft spawn copies "Never forget"?

Did... did Mario die? I didn't know this. We can all agree to up vote this. 6-7 years ago during swim meets I would bring metroid prime hunters for the DS and my friends would be lining up to play. We had an insane amount of fun. 

The Nintendo DS was the good ole days.  those were the days  I'm pretty sure the original DS version had this too I bought the game just because I got tired of using Shy Guy. My favorite person became Shy Guy. 

Wern wer!! Hey!  I made this meme!  Cool.  Cool cool cool  How did you know I only have 7 friends I remember playing mario kart on my ds light as a kid with a bunch of friends I've owned this game almost since day 1. I've been waiting patiently for them to either drop Mario Kart 8 on 3DS or make another Mario Party. I personally thought Island Party was trash. Don't like the race to the finish line concept. Preferred the most stars with bonus stars in the end. Deploying pretty soon, any recommendations on Hyrule Warriors? I've been on the fence for awhile now. Honestly it was the whole reason I ended up getting it, it was great to just give to the little cousins during Christmas and let them all play the same game even if they all didn't have it or bring it to the party Mario Kart DS also allowed sharing of limited maps! It was kind of limited to the base maps iirc, but it was great too for the tech that it had. iirc bomberman did it too It's feature that's hampered by one other problem...region locking. I was in Melbourne for studies, my 3DS is the US set. At a gaming meet-up, I was invited to play with some Mario Kart through the sharing features, but found out I couldn't detect the game or connect because of region-locking :( When it started on the DS it blew my mind. I remember when I first got a Nintendo DS; I was just out of high school and nobody I knew had even heard of it. (It was immediately after the original fat DS released, and let's say Nintendo's marketing wasn't very good around launch time.) One of my friends laughed at me for having "wasted" so much money ($200 for the fat original DS at launch, plus $40 or so for Super Mario 64 DS) because, according to him, "You could have bought a PS2 and like ten games for that much money." I tried telling him about all of the features it had that were, at the time, unheard of (like wifi and game sharing) but he just laughed at me.

Boy was I an idiot- the DS would never amount to anything! Amirite? Right? It's very smart. Kid plays it at a friend's house then wants to play alone? Whelp gotta get it! 

Also it's like a console. Go to a friend's house and play. My Pokemon Go habits are subsidizing Nintendo's business plan Ahh, so that would be why they tried to stop people from posting gameplay a while ago, they don't like free advertising. At least now they have a program to post footage. Thank you. that was.. so serious yet.. yet so deep.  Unless you're No Man Sky.

You just need to hype and presale. That's one of the factors why overwatch was so successful  It looks like that's the case for the new mario party (the one for 3ds) as well. And it's not all shitty like 9 and 10 with the car thing. I thought Mario Party DS was kick ass. It was probably one of my most played DS games. never knew that game had that option too The players that lack the game can only select shyguys  :P :D  It's better to lose with Bowser than win with Toad. Join a cult >7 friends

Look at Mr. Overachiever over here Why more? Nice try Zoidberg. /r/me_irl I feel that this was one of the best features of Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart 7. The fact that you can plan makes it more strategic to an extent, and it's fun to challenge yourself to drive just by watching the bottom screen. Best strat: immediately brake and take second if someone has a blue shell It's on the Wii U virtual console! You can emulate it ! I'm pretty sure it isn't illegal if you own the game

Edit: its only legal if you rip it yourself, downloading is still illegal.   It's not the same, but there's https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studio34/tiny-metal There is a new kickstarter for a game called Tiny Metal which is inspired by Advance wars. Might want to keep an eye on Tiny Metal
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studio34/tiny-metal
It's advance wars in all but name, even has a playable build. 
It won't be handheld though You can also fiddle around to make it work on your 3ds (if you have cfw) hit up /r/3dshacks if your curious That was seriously the best game. Later entries added a new COs, which were cool, and new units, which didn't really improve things. I always felt that the character interactions were more fleshed out in the first one.  You didn't even need more than one system to do multiplayer on that game. /r/advance_wars join us it's a dying breed damn, that game was fun af. Or the DS Fzero for the GBA also did the one cart thing. Feel you, my DS bit it years ago before I got to finish Days of Ruin.

As for the franchise in general, supposedly there's a spiritual successor type deal being made from some of the original creators. I played it via emulator on my android One of my favorite games ever out of my 7 friends........

STOP RUBBING IT IN JESUS. /r/me_irl The 2DS is the most ergonomic model IMO. I can happily sit for hours on MK7, the shape of the shoulder buttons just feel like they were made for comfortable gaming. No hinge adjusting necessary. 

And it fits in the back pocket of my fat ass jeans. Who's laughing now thin and happy people? Not only did they get rid of Waluigi, but they had the nerve to include Waluigi Pinball without including Waluigi I mean we got Daisy for crying out loud. I know there aren't many female Mario characters which needs to be addressed by the company but we could have had Waluigi instead!  I'm pretty sure he's in the Wii U version. Did nobody know the PSP had p2p capabilities on ALL of it's multiplayer games? He's the best char anyway. > "get on my download play homies"

What a G!

 I've beaten all my friends while using shy guy, many times. It's not the kart, it's the player. If you use lots of drift boosts and know the courses, you can easily win Implying you don't play as shy guy anyways So don't be a dick to your friends and just equip the standard kart on yourself too. IIRC Standard Kart is really good. Or, at least, more or less as good as any other since the balancing is pretty good. Likewise with the characters - only minimal differences. Do the characters matter that much? I've only ever played Shy Guy and consistently win  I beg to differ. I can win with Shy Guy. 

I have to change my driving style, but it doesn't by any means make it impossible to win. Wait, really?

I used to play Mario Kart DS with my friend and I always played as a Shy Guy, and I won about half the time.

Are you meaning to tell me that I was only losing 50% of the time because I had a handicap? I heard the shy guy karts take the properties of the original player's karts, no? The better player will always win regardless of kart, believe me. I doubt it. Free Online play will be a huge advantage against Sony Xbox if they get the same games.   This thing goes as far back as age of empires, you only need 1 CD to support 3 players. Use the same CD to install on multiple computers but only 1 of them need to have the disc inserted when playing multiplayer together. Look at me guysss, im social Pretty sure all three of them had similar features (the basic feature is actually part of the console, and the GBA was the first Nintendo handheld to have it), but the GBA and DS versions were definitely gimped compared to everyone having their own cartridge. I'm kind of surprised they pulled it off even on the 3DS, usually the reason it's limited like this is because there's a limit to how much data you can share with one cart multiplayer, and it's usually way less than the whole game. I 'member! You could only play as different colors of Yoshi in the GBA one. In fact, I have two GBAs, a copy of MKSC, and a link cable right here.

The tracks are limited to Mario Circuit 1, Donut Plains 1, Ghost Valley 1, and Bowser Castle 1. All of those are retro tracks, and there are hardly any items on the courses. There are a few item boxes, no coins, and no scenery obstacles. Yes you could definitely play it with 4 people with just one copy for GBA!  I think it was pretty limited but it was awesome!  Sonic for GBA could also do it! My imaginary friend has 6 additional friends I sometimes hang out with. What? That one is the best imo. Even without DLC, there is a great selection of courses. The 3DS version is absolutely fantastic. Really great course selection (should be noted I race 95% of the time though), and the gameplay is of course as fun as ever. Setting up local play is a snap for a tech illiterate like myself. It's probably the game that my girlfriend and I play the most together. It couldn't have been a better game! I'm a bit jealous lol Bro the new 2ds is an absolute steal for 99 dollars. That thing is built like a brick. If you manage to break it you deserve a medal. It might not have a flip cover but it is absolutely amazing. Best 99 dóllars I have spent . It plays all games from previous generations and 3ds games and mario kart cones free as a download. It's an awesome system I bought 2 for myself on my birthday and play with my brothers for kickass late night fun. I will give it you though the new 3ds is a bit pricey but the 2ds punches above its weight considering it's price.  Also the 2ds is not the smartest move in terms of naming so it makes sense that people don't know it's just a flip less 3ds and so many people who see me playing it aslo don't even know what it is. Give it a chance and you will be rewarded.  DS download play.

Edit nevermind I re-read and got what you were doing there. Yeah plus everyone one had that one friend who was a cheater that had mastered the art of drifting boosting. That was a thing?! You like memes too??!? Worth every penny I would say another reason that a lot of people disliked the original Xbox One idea, was having to deal with the always online DRM thing. to me it seemed like the online DRM they proposed was what people disliked, seeing as how it would screw over people who had slow,unreliable or capped internet.

It seemed the biggest problem was that alot of the proposed features were not communicated/explained well leading to some contradicting info, and people being confused as to the exact way the proposed features were meant to work. Ironically, Mario Kart 7 is the best selling 3DS title. I think Triforce Heroes has it and a new Mario Party is coming out on 3DS that is supposed to have download play. Well, you do get some beats in the background. It's no proper music, but better than complete silence. Haha, well.. just about any variation of ass was taken. I was desperate! But I also accept PMs of bread/buns on your booty.  If you didn't, why would you be trying to play a Nintendo game with your friends?  I'm middle school there was a time when only one kid had Mario cart on his DS but also he was the only one that had a DS in the first place. His family was rather well off so he had the smart idea to "lose" his DS and so they bought him another one and he did that two more times over the course of two months until they said no more. So here he is with 4 DS' and we all got to play together. It was great. That's the genius behind it. Nintendo knows it, too. You bought it for this feature, but there's even more to it: Do people play for free? Yes... But they have such a great time, the odds are those free players will buy the game to play with others. Mario Kart Advance FTW. I used to play that with my brothers on GBAs with me on the GameCube GBA adapter. One cart, four player awesomeness, although you needed a tangle of cables. that's something I love about the WiiU too, and what they say the NX will be.  Oh you don't have enough controllers to play smash but the cousins have it on their 3ds'?  Well now everyone can play together on the WiiU Really goes to show nintendos loyalty to the consumer Dude you're awesome. Coming from someone who didn't have a lot growing up , I had  a cousin who offered his game system up,  they will surely appreciate it. 

Edit:[7] This were the days when Nintendo didn't believe in online play. I do that too! And wifi link my family into it from states away :D 

As a matter of fact, that game has led to an annual tradition of buying 3DS's with Christmas money for the past few years...

We have to travel a bit to get to the party, so it's always a highlight of making the long trip for Christmas, and it's a very fun way to connect two families. One Yoshi vs seven Shy Guys Yeah, though it was more due to the limitations of Download Play on the original DS (everything had to be downloaded to memory, which was very limited, and no additional data could be downloaded from the host system after the game launched). Even earlier back, a lot of GBA games had the feature as well. It took forever but you could play some of them with one game cartridge. Super Circuit was a good example of this, to keep on the mario kart theme. Ya it certainly wasn't anything you wanted like the original post seems, it was more of a demo version than full access. Still better than nothing though. I loved the free online on that game! I Wasted so many hours and ruined my d-pad drifting, but it was all worth it for 11-year-old me. It would be nice way to advertise since people would play it with a friend and like it enough to buy it  Does Nintendo get to see that much money from PokemonGO?

The game isn't theirs. Too soon.  :(   I *really* wanted that game to be good.  Steam even offered refunds to people after they played it but I kept it in hopes that they would eventually make the game good.  But still no coins/stars. Mario Party DS was the only one to do it the classic way. Island Tour is *fine*... Star/Coin/whatever Rush looks okay, but still no coin/star mechanics like the good ol days.  I hate the stupid car thing, I was so disappointed when I played the wii u mario party. That and the boards feel super repetitive after you've played a couple times. I remember the DS one and the old n64 ones were much more fun on repeat plays Looks like it, tbh Wait there's a newer Mario Party? I thought the new one for the wii u wasn't as competitive and backstabbing? Nice, that's my pick anyways haha Helpful tip: it's more fun as a follower /r/The_Donald? The cult of the witch might be recruiting. What's the point in even having a group if you don't have someone to exclude? I actually broke the top screen of my DS and taught myself to play like this! It's pretty fun. Not sure that's how it works but I'm downloading now.  That's been proven false many times, but deep down no one gives a rats ass  this is a misconception. its just as illegal whether you own the game or not (not that anyone will really stop you) It's still illegal to download games, but it is legal to play a ROM you ripped from your copy. Emulating is legal, but distributing roms and bios are not That was just adding insult to injury. Daisy is okay, she's been there since forever. The bee, who the hell is that bee? You must be new here. The circle jerk is for Nintendo only.  No way, really? Wow so cool. But since it needs to "download" the game, it gotta take a while. But if you don't own the game you are unlikely to know the courses. I play as shyguy because i like being reminded of minus8 I'm the kind of guy that chooses the 96 bulls to go against my buddy when he chooses the 16-17 Utah Jazz. If he were smart he'd pick up Carl "mail man" Malone and John Stockton to *try* to compete against pippen and Jordan but he doesn't know basketball history so fuck em'. I'm pretty sure it doesn't really matter that much. The differences are pretty small. If you suck you're gonna lose no matter who you pick It's not a handicap, most karts are sidegrades. OP is just bad :\^)

^^Just ^^kidding ^^about ^^you ^^being ^^bad, ^^don't ^^hate ^^me ^^op For racing, it's great. My best memories of Mario Kart have always been battles though. N64 and DS were my favorite. (sorry I actually got the DS and 3DS versions mixed up. I was thinking DS. I haven't actually played 3DS version).

Mario Kart for the DS had amazing battle maps. Mario Kart for the Wii U just has regular levels. Nothing specifically designed for battling.

Edit: Unless they released some in DLC? I haven't actually kept track. I'd fucking LOVE some classic battle maps for Wii U version. I'd like to play the Wii U mario kart. but sadly not even Tick tock Clock course is worth paying like 230 dollars for.  I think he's talking about how Mario Kart 8's battle mode is seriously disappointing because instead of making new and original battle courses this time around, they just took the ordinary racetracks (which are terrible for battling on) and blocked some areas off. I'm more of a racer than a battler so it didn't matter too much to me, but I can imagine how disappointed some people were with MK8's battle mode. MK8 is absolutely the best MK game for races, and it would be the best over-all, but the battle mode is pure trash.  Well then, looks like I'm going to be borrowing my daughters 3DS. I got this game for her when it came out, but never tried it myself.

It's fair, considering that she broke 3(!!!) of my DS's when she was younger (original fat, white DS lite that I gave to her when I got a black one, and then my black one after she broke the white one I gave to her).

Crap. That reminds me that I have a HUGE library of DS games I wouldn't mind playing again. Yeah! The guy who had it would put in the game, we would do download play (I think that's what it was called) and we could choose a character and play with him. Though it wasn't like the full original levels, it was more like competitive mini games set in those levels where you collect coins and such. http://imgur.com/G3kbFjK

Literally took me less than 1 minute As much as your point is valid, there was a time that my friend(s) could come over and play Nintendo games without owning one themselves. I've had many Nintendo parties/nights with a decent group back in the day.

That said, Mario Kart 64 was 4 player game with a single cart (i really do miss couch co-op compared to online play), and Mario Kart DS would let your buddies download play as shyguy. Never got to the total 8 players, but we used to play 6 deep in a coffee shop late at night back when it first released. Great times. Now that's a cool motherfucker right there Pouring one for the unsung heroes of middle school.  Not all heroes wear capes The hero we don't deserve. I salute your friend! And if they don't, they wouldn't have in the first place. ...Shortening cartridge made me think about Double Dash, and I was trying to go through the math of how four people could get on one kart. The third party cables were generally twice the length which made the middle tap functionality much more reasonable even if you weren't sitting across from players 3 and 4. They don't even need to have it, just the 3DS alone will work as a controller at this point. Now that's what SynerJesus Would Do. Not really - it was a smart business move rather than anything altruistic.   Much like Adobe turning a blind eye to pirating photoshop, knowing that folk get used to their application thus keep it in the professional market. My cousin showed me how to play as Shrek in a Tony Hawk game. You are referring to Mario Kart 7: the third of four Mario Kart games to have online play. The DS has roughly 4 MB of RAM for the entire Download Play game to fit inside and execute code within. But it was better than the cartridge-free games sent via link cable to the Game Boy Advance - that one only had 256KB of RAM. That pretty much is how I got into every game I liked until about age 13. Good way to get friends too >Nintendo may profit as a part-owner of Niantic, and Nintendo is also a 32%-owner of Pokémon Co., which has long controlled the merchandising of Pokémon characters and describes itself as the producer of the “Pokémon Go” game. In addition Nintendo itself plans to sell a $35 hand-held device called Pokémon Go Plus that would make it easier to catch the digital creatures in the game.

>Adding all that up, the stock market has judged that Nintendo today is worth about $12 billion more than it was a week ago.  


http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-go-fueled-nintendo-just-keeps-going-1468302369 Just look at their action who went up. You dont even need to count the money they made with the game, only the impact it had on the company. :) > The game isn't theirs.

The game is definitely riding on the fact that it's pokemon. Niantic is a reason not to play it. No but it's working to get people to play other games. I finally decided I'm gonna get a 3DS and I'm already halfway to it in the savings department. Then I'm gonna buy all the Pokemon games I missed out on. I think he might be referring to the one that's coming real soon, if it's not already out.  Island Tour actually didn't have single-card multiplayer if I recall. Both maps and the minigames in Island Tour sucked. One map was only available with three or four human players, with no computers. To 100% the game you needed three 3DSs. Wait if there are no coins/stars then what the fuck do you do? Just race to the end? They got tired of all the ruined friendship complains I'm glad they added him as a full character in MK7. I slightly envied my friends who didn't have MKDS, because that was the only way you could play as Shy Guy in that game You make more money as a leader though Money:leader::fun:follower but more money as a leader But but leader? More money as a leader? But... you make more money as a leader. True. However, if one were to become a leader, they would gain more money than if they were not. The Creed is strong in this thread. Mo' leader, Mo' money. But you make more leader as a money Best sub on reddit IMHO. Right-wing social justice warriors? No thanks! I don't know if it's just the way my Reddit feed is setup, but every time I'm on /r/all I see at least one post from the Donald and I'm not even subscribed to that subreddit. Is anyone else having this issue? might be? How slothful. Exactly. The only reason I have friends is so I can feel superior to them

Jk. i don't have any friends. I had an old broken DS like this, and I loved playing with the added challenge of the top screen just being red lines.  
  
You want to know the reason for the broken DS screen? Playing Mario Kart DS Airship Fortress and walking up the stairs and dropping it.  
  
EDIT: Couldn't remember how to spell the name of the course This made me lol Of everyone, Nintendo seems to care a lot more than any other publisher. They have really cracked down on ROM sites, serving up lots of DMCA notices. You can download an N64 emulator for Xbox One right now on the Xbox Store. Costs like 10 bucks though performance is spotty too. There is another free emulator called Nexbox that supports NES, SNES, GBA, GBC, and Genises games though that is playable via the Xbox One's web browser. It's called Nesbox.

 https://www.ticgn.com/nesbox-nintendo-emulator-xbox-one-now-supports-game-saves/

 IIRC pirating is still illegal, but ripping your own copy is legal. If you copy it off the cartridge yourself and emulate it, it could be legal.

But if you download it, it's probably illegal. It's not like it really, REALLY, matters though. If the issue is with ethics and morals, knowing you payed for the game and you contributed to the devs is enough for you to re-download and old game you lost. Although there's still the anti-circumvention aspects of the DCMA that make it illegal to break DRM in most cases, even for legitimate uses, unless the Librarian of Congress gave an exception within the last 2 years. Not to mention patent laws that could be broken in the process. That's a damn good point actually. Her bio on IGN is "Like Rosalina, she is from the Super Mario Galaxy series, only not as important. " It was still pretty cool sharing huge games like syphon filter. I mean, I'd be disappointed if I put many hours into a game and I could be immediately beaten by someone who has never played. how about Gabe 'Glueman' Degrossi? Good thing you weren't playing '93 NBA Jam, [it was a rigged game.](http://nesn.com/2013/09/report-nba-jam-was-rigged-against-chicago-bulls-included-code-that-made-them-shoot-bricks-at-end-of-games/)  NBA! Hang time! Lol carl If you like it enough, you should consider picking up a 2DS if you'd like to hop back into the DS library and check out some amazing 3DS titles. It's an economical way to dive into the 3DS library while maintaining backwards compatibility with DS games.

Feel free to check out /r/3ds if you'd like any more information, or just Google "best 3ds games" to get a good idea of the library. It's arguably my favorite system ever. Sorry. It might have been the top selling game at one point since it is released before x and y Smart, caring, and rich? Guys, I think we found Batman. [removed] everyone drives a jeep  If they don't have Smash on 3DS they'll instead need a $2 app from the 3DS eShop to connect the system to the game. Don't think there's a way to do it without the game. 

Still neat that they offer it to people if they don't wanna shell out $40. I don't think those things, in this situation, are mutually exclusive... I mean they do both. It satifies as a good business move, and ensures brand loyalty. Shrek is love. Shrek is life. I set my cousin up with my mojang account and do his PC clean up/maintenance for him. Hes 10. [Somebody once told me...](https://youtu.be/nn6mSnEGF-M?t=1m23s) Aren't cousins amazing ? Too bad I'm an asshole of one lol Ah,  good times. I remember I completed the game and was like 'oh you have Waluigi? I have the  alternate title screen AND can play as any character and kart in the game.' Then my R button broke. 

Good times.  yup. 13 is around the age where you start playing with your dingus more than your friends.  Actually the stock went down when Nintendo revealed they only really have a 12% share in the game when you factor in their part-ownership of PokeCo and the amount of Niantic's stake in the game IIRC Holy sweet mother of Mario! I really thought they weren't making bank with the app!

Thanks for the info! But poor Pokken still languishes mostly unloved by daddy Nintendo T_T

Splatoon, too. I think if Nintendo were to pour as much cash into its competitive scene as Riot Games sinks into LoL they could really get something going. 



But then I'm the kinda weirdo who plays Nintendo games as an adult, so maybe I don't know a ton about marketing Yes it does. In fact, it is the only way to play with local friends. Yeah it did. 

Star Rush (the new one releasing in November) won't be fully playable through Download Play, but can still be played 4-Players and 1 Copy. Instead, all players will have to download a free app (Mario Party Guest) and whatever progress they made into the Guest application, can be transfered if they ever decide to buy their own copy. There's a new Mario party, besides island tour? Nope I bought Island Tour exclusively because it has one card multiplayer throigh download play.  Yep, just different variations on that. Glorified Chutes and Ladders. Man I keep on reading MK as Mortal Kombat and it's some kind of inside joke. IIRC, if you held down the "select" button during the loading screen after choosing your character, you would turn into a shy guy as well! In MK8 you can change his color if you have the DLC, and it's awesome.

I really wish I could use it, but I have to play as Larry Koopa every time on account of my name is Larry. Creed. Bratton. Is the new manager! They have the best Kool-Aid, *the best*. It definitely the most humble sub on the site.  But you could settle your political disagreements with a grand prix /r/all is the top posts from every sub. The_Donald just upvotes everything is they end up with dozens of top posts.  But it's very unlikely that Nintendo would charge someone for having such an illegal copy, if he also owns a legal copy. Would only make bad press and the money they get from it wouldn't be worth it. Probably because they're emulating their old games now. But $10 for a 30 year old game? Yeah right. nintendo more than anyone is *still selling* those old games,   (why pay to emulate when its easy to do free.)   to most *other* companies its more like not bothering to fight 'abandonware'

still annoying, but you can easily see why they do it > could

> probably

you're not very convincing... Yeah, I don't feel that bad using a rom for a game I currently own or paid for at one point. To be honest though I have a snes and have ended up picking up a lot of these games again over the last few years.  Yes, I usually stick to using download games for ROM hacks and the like which is sorta like a different game. That's why I liked the balloon battle in DS I don't know if the 3ds has it but hitting friends with shells was more fun the racing them anyway, and the person who owns the game doesn't specifically have an advantage there. The original Shit Character! TIL! I loved that game... I have a pretty huge 3DS library as well thanks to my daughter. I had been thinking about playing it for a while, but I have so many other games to keep me occupied that I haven't gotten around to it :(

DS was one of my favorite gaming systems ever. I really need to give the 3DS a shot. You're right. I might go get myself a 2DS. Ah, don't worry.

Next time, just do some research when you're telling something.

Don't want to come as offensive or what, but it's for the better if you double-check it. Nope. That kid's still got parents. Same How do you get the alternate title screen? And what did it look like? Googled for a bit, but couldn't find it How? That game is frustratingly hard... Hah I also 100 percented that game and I would never lose to my brothers or friends. They hatred playing with me and would call me Jap. Alternate title screens, takes me back... Anyone here ever get the F-Zero X alternate title screen and the X Cup? ಠ_ಠ Vintage memes over here. Well getting Steam coincided with getting good internet so you have a point there. My friends still played with my dingus more than I did till I was 20. Their stock went down but not as far as it had been, so it was overall a gain for them, which makes sense since they should be seeing some profit. They own a chunk of the Pokemon Company. The market overhype shit all the time, still they made money with PoGo Which is honestly better than just as well. That's pretty sweet. Mario Party: Star Rush is a new Mario Party coming out for 3ds in November Man when are they gonna learn that the coins/stars format is what everybody wants? Shyguy's my favourite character in MK, I know all his combos and fatalities.  I've had the same thing happen to me, but the other way around I'm fairly sure that that was an Action Replay code, unfortunately. [deleted] I paid 10 dollars for Earthbound on the Wii U. I'd never played it before so I personally think it was worth it, but to each their own.

Edit: Spelling Eh we pay $10 for films and books older than that...
And $10 for earthbound is a great deal Lawyers can always argue something. It's hard to be sure if you're in the clear, or in the wrong. I prefer demon lord Zaraxos, frankly. Much better character development. We can fix that  For now. . . EVEN BETTER THAN BATMAN?! Now kiss Coming this Fall

DAT'S A SPICY MEME! You have nice friends 😏 Did they change it back to OG Mario party? Island tour was one of the biggest disappointments of any game I have ever purchased.  How could they ever possibly imagine a world without coins/stars and then execute that imagination. This is goddamned brilliant. This is an underrated comment I fucking love you  book technology hasn't really advanced though. This comment chain brought to you by fruit!

Not true at all. Best combo is either of the Koopas and diddy kong.

Mistakenly double posted, still getting used to Baconreader and my connection went wonky while I was trying to send so I had assumed it failed to get through. He was an altar boy We haven't seen all the modes yet, but it looks like they're doing something new again. It looks more fun than the whole ship thing, but it's not like the old games. they probably wont ever change it back to the original mario party because of hte fact that the company who developed it originally(Hudson Soft) no longer exists(bankruptcy in 2012). this has been true since after Mario Party 8. COINCIDENTLY, many members of hudson soft joined nintendo's ND division(develops the new mario party games, and wii party), which is why Wii Party U is very similar to OG mario party. But alas, not all the members stayed, which kinda skewed mario party in different directions. As someone who's been looking at it for just the download play mind if I ask what was so bad about it? No Jesus is reverse Batman, he died and his parents didn't. Every time I see that sub linked it seems like the most tame bullshit.  YOU DONT MAKE A BATMAN WITHOUT BREAKING A FEW EGGS  I already fixed it. And you, are not coming back. [deleted] ...foursome? ;) albeit a paratroopa player. In the right hands, I believe that Diddy + Bowser Jr is a better combination. Bowser shells come out more often than triple shells. Triple shells also goes into rng of what color you receive. Bowser shells are also effective at taking down some stage hazards For the tougher races I always felt like I had to go DK/Bowser + Paratroopa so I could use Bowser's kart (which IIRC had the highest top speed out of all the karts you start with). Otherwise, even if I had a perfect race, I'd often get beaten by karts with higher top speeds. Was that not an issue for you? I figured. Just trying to be a mad lad Got em Haha  Nope. Now it's an orgy is a 5 some a thing? Y'all don't know the true power that is Baby Bowser + Paratroopa + Mushroom Kart. Giant shells for defense, triple homing shots for offense, and the most forgiving kart in the game. I never used any big characters because it's way too hard to handle their carts I went with blue go cart and every time speed doesn't matter if you're constantly get your power slides /r/madlads "What 'celebrity' shall we call, to make a 1 minute advert with good CGI, followed by 2 seconds of game footage....on a tablet that's filmed from far away?"

Sometimes funny, sometimes emotional, always gritty, this instant classic (lol, marketing) from the same studio that brought us "Frustrating Puzzle Thing Damn" follows generic protagonist Guy Armiguy as he resolves a war that he honestly couldn't care or know less about.  We were not originally sold play testing a recent press demo of the title, but once we saw our hero shrug and casually walk past the first level boss because he (and we quote), "don't need this shit today", we were hooked.  The graphics are ... okay.  We don't remember the soundtrack.  What really stuck out in our minds was the scene where Guy tells the UN Security Council, "Damnit, can't you fuckers just stop with the war bullshit already?  I got shit to do."

Launch the Poopy Diddle of the Pokemans If I ever made a game it'll now be called "Diddle the Wizards". Thank you! Diddle of the Carrots is going to be the best god damn hit of 2016. "Paladins of the Realm" is four links below this one the front page. King of the Poopy Fart of the Poopy... Ah, yes. The classics. The funny thing is this is what we (they) actually do when naming new mobile games. TowerSensor is a good tool to check and help us doing ASO. This shit is important for a mobile game success. It's always the same base/tower defense game too, just reskinned.  I wonder how much budget goes into advertising versus actual game. I still can't believe Arnold agreed to basically be the face of a game like Mobile Strike. Money must be tight.  Can we get Sandra Bullock to endorse Diddle of Sadness? One with big tits.  The only problem I have with advertisement department is they use footage from other games (mostly warhammer and age of empire footage) and then they put their title on the bottom.  \> 5 million Downloads bootleg games titles are hilarious Ah yes Call of Modern War: Warfare Duty

The game where you go to your 9-5 job as a subcontractor for the military monitoring drones.  [This one](http://imgur.com/SaDjRzU) sounds good as well. And all those idiots naming everything flappy, crossy or angry thinking their is going to sell because of that The whole saga thing really irks me. Saga is a word with a specific meaning. Slapping it at the end of a random series of words pertaining to a re-skined matching game instantly makes me not want to play it. BEST MODERN WARPLANE DOGFIGHT GAME.

Even though those words make sense it feels like gibberish. What bothers me most is the fucked up whitespace use.

"Call of ModernWar:Warfare Duty"

What. What the fuck is "ModernWar"? Where is your space after the semi colon? Ugh. I need to see that space. 

Could it be more shit? How about 
"CallOf ModernWar   :WarfareDuty" you know, maybe stick some extra spaces in where they shouldn't be?  I just want to know, why would a dev spend hours coding and making a game (even if its shit, it still takes time) and then name it something stupid like this?

Diddle the Wizard  *I put on my robe and wizard hat* You need the middle part...though "Diddle of the Wizzard" sounds like a very different game it said pick two, not four. I would actually preorder this game. You were only supposed to pick two you fucking retard Are there portals or giant worms in this game? I giggled.  I imagine that cover photo being a butthole, mouth agape, shouting. Oh and the sequel is going to be so crazy. I guess they're on some religious shit then. Bioshock was ported to mobile... And subsequently taken off Some of the puzzle games are decent for passing the time on the train, and shout out to Alto's Adventure for being an awesome infinite runner style game that's free on Android with no demand for IAP. 

There's some great content being made, but digging it out of the turd circus can be tricky. Really if you stick with Editor's Choice, you'll probably at least get a couple hour's worth of enjoyment out of any game.  You thought people stopped playing mobile games?  More people play mobile games than any other platform. They make up over 39% of all money spent on gaming and its only going to get bigger.

http://i.imgur.com/IFlNial.png "still?" I thought we are still in the middle of "age of mobile games" or something.... years ago I never thought I'd see a commercial for a phone game on TV, now I see them all the time. I've never played any of them, the only game I really play on my phone is some bust-a-move clone, but they seem really popular. I played that game five  minutes ago. Had to change my pants afterwards. Yet people keep playing them.  I don't blame the developers/marketers.  Or the same generic Bejeweled-styled puzzle game. Enough to impress me that they make that much money for those kinds of advertising.  the former governor of California is the face of a mobile phone game. Just think about that  They probably paid him $1 million and only need to turn up for 1 day of shooting. Even if you already have $100m, it would be tempting.  I thought the opposite. The makers of Mobile Strike must be flush.  Why not, the part he gets in the ad fits his typecasting anyway. That was me when she took off her wildcats sweater in *Speed* ಠ_ಠ how 5/5 stars (in the picture they use to advertise) >4.4 stars https://i.gyazo.com/112eb544a5ea9378f433481afe81b0a4.png Browsing the mobile store is like browsing games from the NES and Atari days, when you could get away with calling your game "Hockey" or "Go Fast Cars". Honestly the line between bootleg and "real" games is so blurry now. I remember it used to be NES games at the flea market with sprites/text clumsily swapped out; now it's pretty much entire high-quality games built from the ground up but they're still called "Man Of BartleMdoernWar 2 Kart". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU6WC4dpaHM This is the story of a soldier named Stanley. 

Stanley worked for the military in a big building where he was Soldier #427. Soldier #427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a joystick. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buildings to blow up, when to blow them up, and in what order. This is what Soldier #427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy. 

And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley; something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi.' Never in all his years in the military had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. 

Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.  The flying kind or the office kind?  That soldier looks so sad...these games really give artists a great outlet! >thinking

They do sell. > \>5 million downloads.

Followed closely by down fall of the sharts. Damnit u/AFRICAN_BIG_COCK give it 2 years and this will be a game. Maybe they will use today's time to make it topical then it would be called, "Age of Time: Trump Takedown" or "Age of Time: Hillary to Heel" *Let the rabbits wear glasses!* You never expect the neutral milk hotel lyrics.

Im 38 and Fart of Vengeance was the first thing I picked out and it gave me a little chuckle. There was a particularly stinky game of domino's I played with my grandmother a  long while back that ended with us both falling out of our seats laughing. *12.5 Attack on Poopy Can't forget about the shallots, and that's why their rebooting the series so they can include more vegetables No, no, they paid pre-development microtransactions for the extra words so it's okay. Dead Space got it's own mobile game, then was removed by EA :( The Room series is a good puzzle series on mobile and the first two are also on steam, only a couple bucks apiece but theyre fun for a couple hours each I don't blame the developers that make those games, I see tons of people playing slot machine games on their phones so the bar is set pretty low.  I do wish I could find a single decent mobile game through all the shit, though.  I have pretty much given up on mobile gaming, I just emulate SNES and Game boy games because at least I know they will entertain me without trying to con me into spending fucktons of money on bullshit. Every game I've seen with a high budget commercial like that then stayed number 1 on the app store for quite a while When you think about it like that.... If I had $100m I would still feel stupid if I didn't do a day's worth of work for another million There is not much I wouldn't do for 1 million :/ To be fair, lots of people buy downloads to boost their popularity on the app stores these days for free games along with positive reviews that are like 1 liner 5 star reviews. Google said they have 1.4 billion Android users, while Apple has at something around 500m. I'm pretty sure that there's some sort of sketchy Chinese pay-to-download shenanigans in the Play Store *A lot* of kids have phones today To start with, they don't show any screenshots Grand theft fallout: Max Tomb Raiding Payne  [deleted] >high-quality

Pick one And then was shot by the enemy drone operator Oh god LOVE that game. LOVE that game. Drone Dronefare It's mostly because the title generates the most weight on search traffic. It's why you will see loaded app titles with a ton of keywords in them.

And believe me it works. When the app is in front of more people chances are it'll be downloaded more. That's just how it is. And this is a problem, because people shouldn't think that's funny. It should be a red flag. They're not idiots if they have fun playing it Diddle of the Poopy /r/BadDragon nsfw Some of us do want to lay the dragon, you prude. /r/scalieporn Woah now, save that for e621.net You and my mom both. 

*tear* I could see it as an idle clicker game where you tap wizards on your screen to generate a resource to attract more wizards and upgrades. Maybe you play as a giant that likes to poke wizards. Flynt Coal found out your dad is Mister Diddlez, pay 2 gold to keep him quiet. I made that game.  I guess I named it wrong.

This is necessary. Bless you.  Me too, thanks. Rofl I can't breathe. I honestly think the joke has some sort of root in human DNA. It just seems to run in our jeans.  I had no idea commas were a thing. I just call them inverted quotation marks. > I had no idea calling them inverted commas was a thing

I promise you, it's really not. I'd have thought inverted commas were when just one ' is used (i.e. 'like an apostrophe') Agreed. I'm a 22 y/o 'lady' who struggled to read some Reddit comments about embarrassing farts at the gym because I was laughing so much. Sie sind das essen und wir sind die jaeger One guy with money, invited me, the guy with coding skills, to make the games he couldn't find for his children (he had a 3 year old boy and a just-born girl).

We made good games, no ads, no microtransactions, and so on.

Reviews from specialized media, and the public, were usually above 4.5 (my guess is that our average across all games is 4.7)

Yet... we didn't sold much, and while looking for our own games in the store, we finally found lots of other good ones.

We found out that what is going on, is that the games that get in the "top list" or are scammy (many lists are organized by earning/time, and a good way to hit the top, is do outright scammy things, for example a popular game in my country had invisible banners, thus it racked millions in fraudulent money and shoot up to the first spot... Apple then returned all the advertisers money, and banned the guy from the store, but he was already famous after hitting the first spot, and the clones of his game became a new genre of sorts) or they belong to companies that are media, or have connections with media (example: my biggest competitors were Disney, that has connections with media, and Toca-Boca, that is owned by a multi-billion sized media company named Bonnier Group).

Or they had friends on Google and Apple HQ (the HQ! I for example had a Google Brazil employee talk to us, review our game formally, recommend for the HQ to put it in the recommended front page, yet we never made it, instead lots of shitty stuff made it, that had authors that were ex Google HQ employees or friends of Google HQ employees).

So... we gave up, the games are still up, and sometimes we update them, but it is not profitable the effort to make good games, at least not without deep media connections, and since we don't have those...

(if you are curious: http://www.kidoteca.com) Try Auralux, Pocket Mortys, and Evil Apples.

Also you can play the entirety of Knights of the Old Republic on your phone so try Pixel Dungeon Puzzle and Dragons is a top tier mobile game (just hit 1000 days) that you can progress forever in without spending a dollar.  Rusty Lake Hotel is good puzzle game with Lynchian sorta vibe (if that floats your boat)

Lifeline is a good twist on a text adventure.

I'm sure there are other great games out there but it's difficult to wade through all the shit. Does Hearthstone count? I play that at work all day You tried Mobius Final Fantasy? It's got actual 3D graphics (admittedly from a PS2 era or so but it's legit 3D) and it's actually pretty F2P-friendly, all things considered. I just found out today that there is a pathfinder game on iOS. It's like a mix of Pathfinder and Magic the Gathering. Pretty neat so far. Final Fantasy Record Keeper is free and is really great at weekly events and. The High level stuff is really fun. Also there is FF Mobius that just came out and it even has multiplayer boss battles. 
/r/FFRecordKeeper/ /r/FFRecordKeeper/ [deleted] To be fairer, publishers put ads in their previous hit game about their new game

Doing this costs nothing "grwat game would pay again" by a "person" named Pradeep.  I'm not so sure, there are 1+ billion active Android devices, so a free game downloaded by 5+ million people is more than possible, though probably most people just download it and delete it within 2 minutes.  App store too. It's not Chinese, but it works. Knock-off names for Popular Titles:

Unreal Halfshock: Overfortress Final Arkham 2 The games from the Humble Bundles have been the best mobile games I've played. Many were well-reviewed Indy desktop games ported over. They put the micropayment bullshit to shame. As a piece of art in the classical sense it is superb. It seeks to explore a question about the human condition in a truly unique way and guides the player to come to the inevitable conclusion in a way that makes them feel as though it was their own idea, which in a way, is the entire lesson of the game. When people say things like "videogames just teach violence" or whatever, I point them to that game, because I don't think any other game demonstrates the potential of videogames as a form of art as much as The Stanley Parable.  I know it's because of the search, like the example above; even in the description they embed nonsense key words. At least right now that I searched, most of those are just clones, and are free. I remember a few years ago, all angry everything, not free, and had nothing to do with the angry birds gameplay Fart of the Poopy Call of Poopy I was thinking Launch of the Poopy. Battle of the poopy! /r/dragonsfuckingcars NSFW I didn't need that in my life.  just......why? Not judging, but where does that craving come from? "*Yurr Mum got Wizard diddled Harry.*" [deleted] Brave words from a wizard diddler. So like a cookie clicker clone, but instead it's wizards. *The Battle Arena of Fire Carrots* doesn't sound too shabby... I liked "Battle Launch of the poopy Lords," if that helps at all. *Shrug* I'll play it That game looks like shit.  
  
Or is the shit.  
  
Pick either.  
  
I'm here to pun, not judge. I decided to check your game out...now I'm addicted. Cool little idea, thought if have fun for 5 minutes. Well now I can't stop trying to earn enough poop to buy the next defensive weapon, hahaha! Well done Mr Poopadoop, ya got me hooked at least!!  Looks like plants vs zombies but with poop. Doesn't strike me as super duper original. Thanks. I will build walls of diapers  You should definitely post it. Thank you. 3/10 Get out. I almost corrected you before I realized your dank Chipotle pun. We all find out something :)
New Why not start a mobile game review website dedicated to finding quality games? That's the part of the ecosystem that we're missing. There's no good "app/game review" website that's ubiquitous.  What a shame. I'm sorry you couldn't attain the success you deserved for being willing to stray from the pack. That kind of attitude should always be rewarded. Most insightful post ever. I believe it. Thank you.  Mobile applications, and just phones in general, are stuck in such a closed system between the phone companies and Google/Apple. It feels claustrophobic trying to do anything on my phone compared to using my PC, and it's not because of the screen size. There's not much room for natural growth. I hate to hear that. For what it's worth, your games look high quality.  I will try and introduce them to my niece.   You guys still made a few! And they look pretty good, indeed. It's a shame that the quality of content isn't what matters the most, but the people you know and how well you know them. It's a sad world we live in. Fart of the Poopy is good, too.  Pocket Mortys is awesome Ang some of the GTA games  I played through all of KOTOR on my iPad when I got sick over a holiday vacation. That game saved my sanity.  How? Star Wars Uprising as well, it's a game that has a lot of depth for being on mobile No mention of Pixel Dungeon? What's up with that game? I download it, try it, can't get past the 3rd floor of the first level, get mad and uninstall it. Like is it just me or is that game really fucking hard? I prefer Cardinal Quest 2. Oh, seriously? I saw all their ads and it looked like one of those shitty "match 3" clones that are everywhere Is this one of those "you could theoretically go on forever for free, but practically speaking all of the high level content is time gated behind ridiculous timers unless you spend real money"?  Ooh, I only need 1,000 Potato points for this final tier power, but free players only get a 33% chance at one potato per day... Isn't Hearthstone a port though? 
Maybe OP was thinking of games that came originally for mobile  What?  No no no, commercials work by subconsciously subverting your free will and tricking you into giving your money to some shadowy company. I learned that on Reddit. You're right. But they go far beyond that. Download the new game and get X premium currency/one time loot rewards! Where did you get 1+ billion devices? Genuinely interested, that's pretty staggering could have been downloaded maliciously as well, through mobile advertisements The Beast Slayer III: Wild Hunter 

Nuclear Holocaust Simulator 2277

The Cry From Afar: Tribal Instincts 

Duty Calls: Operators of the Dark

Atomic Number 75 cogwheel coagulated: Soldier VS Zombies That last one sounds cool.

What are the originals called for Fated Destiny, and Demolition Soccer? Doubt it was intentional, but super smash flash is an actual fan game. Technically, Super Smash Flash is a fangame When did Team Fight Houses 1 come out? Super Smash Flash is just a fan game though. Age of Time Fart of betrayal  Fart of Some Shit Fart of betrayal  Not gonna lie, I might be inclined to play "Fart of Betrayal." Advanced fartfare sooo... Angry Birds? Fart of the Poopy /r/dragonsfuckingdragons (NSFW, it's exactly what you think.) /r/carsfuckingdragons Or did you? Yer a diddle wizard harry! I AM MONSTER TRUCK! Dawn of the Poopy sounds inspirational.  Sounds like a badly subtitled Chinese version of the third Hobbit movie. Give her a go.  :)

I think it plays the best on an Android tablet. It was my first mobile game.  I originally made it for the iPad but iTunes rejected it.  On small phone the UI can be a bit small.  

It was originally supposed to be a quick game that I made. The original demo took less than a day to make.  But the rest took about 4-5 months.  I even did some research and tried to add historically themed poop bosses. 
 [deleted] Chocolate shake! et too? I give it a solid #2. Not even  [deleted] I would use this. It's hard finding actual games for mobile. Why not a subreddit? TouchArcade used to be the go-to site for devs to get good feedback and critical reviews. They still have reasonable coverage but nowadays a good review there only nets you a few thousand downloads so it's not really worth your time to advertise on the site.  Like...touch arcade?  Yeah...that stuff is there but the people who play that garbage don't read blogs about that garbage.  Lot of them just fuck around with it at work and shit.  

The real problem here is google and apple who of course profit by taking their cut from the uber scammy popular games and so create a marketplace where those games get preferential treatment + cater to the good ol' boys club.  Google and Apple and most of the valley are everything people claim to hate from corporate America circa 1950's but somehow they've managed to fool these retards into thinking otherwise.  I mean seriously...why the fuck would a customer actually want a default filter of "MOST REVENUE EARNED".  Think about that.  I like Diddle of the Pokemans Fart of Some Shit is better imho... I'm actually really digging clash of carrots  I played Attack of the Sadness for a few hours but it left me feeling empty and dead inside. Would not recommend.  Eh...  It is pretty shallow and just full of endless grinding.  I wouldn't recommend it. Lol just look it up in the Play store. It's an official port.

A MOGA controller makes it even better. Like the other guy said, it's in the play store. It's also free on Amazon Underground apparently but I have no idea what that means because I have an iPhone ): It's a roguelike game, they tend to be pretty tricky. Try using the wiki, trial and error. The genre is not for everyone.  Its a rougelike so yeah its really hard. You're supposed to play it over and over again and get a bit further every time. The most important part is to never go to the next level before you have explored pretty much everything on the level you are at, because you need everything you find to survive later. The more you play it the further you'll get. You might like Sprouted Pixel Dungeon more, it's a different version that basically removes hunger and gives you more revives in exchange for bigger maps and more challenging enemies, but ends up being both easier and more fun.  It's easily the best mobile gaming experience I've had and I wish there were more turn-based dungeon crawlers for mobile, the touch interface is perfect for it. think of it more as a match 3 RPG game with elements similar to pokemon and that's pretty much what puzzles and dragons is Not that it's a guarantee of quality, but it does have 2 3DS games. I've had it for a long time. There's a LOT more depth than you'd expect in the team building. It definitely is a game that spending money makes easier. I'd say if you like it, spend $20. You'll save yourself a shit load of grinding.

Also, read a lot on it before getting too far. IIRC the PaD reddit and fb communities were garbage, but that was a couple years ago. I found puzzleanddragons forum to be the better players and to give much better advice/discussions/etc. That is from a couple years ago though, so take it with a grain of salt. 

You'll also probably want to restart for a better lead once you get comfortable with the game.  Quite the opposite really. For you look up any YouTube videos on it you'll see how much goes into the game. The updates have been making it a lot easier on new players by speeding up progression  It's the good games the others are all shitty clones of. https://youtu.be/IM8f-H0NQ3s

You might observe that it's ever so slightly more complex than match 3 Thats what i thought too until i played it. PAD is so much more wouldn't exactly call them a clone, they're pretty much the original mainstream Match-3 RPG Not at all. You do need stamina to run dungeons, but stamina refreshes every 3 minutes, and you rank up (refilling the stamina bar) quite often until you hit the high ranks (300+). Plus you get the in-game currency for free every time there's an event, whenever you clear a dungeon, etc, so they don't pressure you to spend money.

It's been like 3 years and I've spend like, $10 on it.  And Hearthstone isn't exactly something you play without at least spending some money on it. I mean, Hearthstone can also be played on the PC but it really just feels like a mobile/iPad game. smoke. It's funny how some people think that they're supposed to feel like "DAMN I WANT A PEPSI" after watching their commercial. "Hah, this shit don't work on me, stupid marketing people!".

No, commercials are paid for so the next time you feel like having a soda in the local store, you go for the one you remember/know of.  I'm not them, but [here's](http://androidcentral.com/google-says-there-are-now-14-billion-active-android-devices-worldwide) something from Google from a year ago saying there's 1.4 billion active Android devices. most of india and a lot of china.

Don & Yancy's The Revision

Cursed Souls 3 Fated **Destiny**

What other game do you know features Demolition derby, and Soccer combined? Doubt it was intentional, but super smash flash is an actual fan game. It was. 2deep4me I would play it. Fart of Betrayal Someshit warfare Call of Booty: Black Cocks 3 /r/dragonpenis as well Ay. ;) Clicking anyways.  I would totally buy Dawn of the Poopy Vengeance. iTunes are real app nazis. Try resubmitting it :D Both of those seem right up the average redditors alley It's *tu. 9/10 /r/Androidgaming I want to play the sequel to Age of Someshit. If you have Amazon Prime you get apps for free. I'm not sure if Underground is on iOS, I thought it was. so kinda like 10000000? And, apparently, an anime. So... yeah.  Is it US only? Can't find it in UK Play Store. The thing I loved most about PAD in comparison to say Battle Camp is that it's completely a free to play game! Patience and time rewards, I've got the Awoken Sakuya team now and it's working pretty well, working towards Ra now 😂 I used to play Battle Camp a ton though just cause it had a different aspect to get matching compared to PAD, but it was and still is an intense pay to win game. 
 Hearthstone is the best free mobile game I ever paid $50 for. Are you smoking yet?? Weed Mah Bitcoins! they're all ova the fuckin flo! Thanks! Any idea how many Apple devices? I just need to know so I can shove it in the face of my other half family's face. I already do after eating Taco Bell Sounds like a good south park mobile game
Edit: then I read your name...bravo sir Yup. I have no shame either. ಠ_ಠ I could make a sequel... *Dawn of the Poopy, it's time for number 2!* Am I glad I clicked "show more comments". Thanks! pretty much, except from being on a timer and having only one guy attacking you instead form a team of monsters that attack based on the matches and combos you make in a turn-based fashion It's one of the most popular mobile games in Japan as well, so that's not surprising. moderately  Errday ["Over a billion"](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10835748/apple-devices-active-1-billion-iphone-ipad-ios) in January. Both company's numbers include all devices on their OS (phones;  tablets; mac computers/chromebooks; smartwatches). 

I would assume Apple has a larger share of the traditional "computer" market (computer in quotes because anything running their OSs is a computer, but you know what I mean) and Android has a larger share of the smartphone market. Apple will never release their specific phone numbers though because they want to maintain their "top selling phone" marketing, since, well, there's only 1 iPhone as opposed to hundreds of Android phones to choose from.  I knew that but...an anime??? What the fuck??? Every fortnight  That's pretty nice. There better be Waldo somewhere in there.

Edit: Found him! Well played OP... I'd buy this. Based on interest I tried setting up a Zazzle store for prints here: http://www.zazzle.ca/alandercoloringpages/products

I've never done anything like this before though so let me know if it's working or not or if you have any better suggestions. Indeed you did. But well done. Did you draw this? Holy smokes, either way. Kudos on the excellent product! Dude what are you doing, you uploaded an UNwater marked high res version!! Someone is going to steal this and reproduce it. It's fucking awesome, but seriously reduce the resolution  This is impressive stuff man. How long did it take for both pencil and colouring? I can draw a straight line... no wait a minute, I can't.

This is amazing.  Can I print a copy for my next road trip with the kids? I love some of your pattern decisions. Like, for example, Pac-Man's smile serves to make him part of two different elements. His upper side is the Windows corner and his lower side is the Nintendo corner. A lot of other ingenious little things. And Spirited Away is I suppose like a non-gaming Easter egg. I feel like ratchet and clank is super underrated. With that said, thank you for putting quark on this Colorizebot Have you made any other posters of this kind? I think more of your art would be appreciated. Truly amazing achievement.

(Also, why no Klei? D: ) am i looking over solid snake? Dark wallpaper version if you're interested: [3840 x 2160 HQ](http://i.imgur.com/1OC0ozs.jpg) Pretty impressive. What was your inspiration for this? Holy crap this is well done. ayy Professor Layton  Honest question about you artist that can draw this kind of stuff.  Did you envisioned it all ahead or just go on a whim.  For me even then, you still have to think what to draw next to make it look uniform. It's not even just grouping characters by their color. It's all of the characters in between and the way that they're oriented to align with the lines. Well done, this is incredible!  its amazing. i wish it had Klonoa though :( Christ you even got Caithe in from GW2 No love for the Master Chief or Halo? :-( FWIW, I don't think you spent too much time on this. I think you spent exactly the right amount of time making something awesome. This is awesome! I wonder if anybody can name every single character within this poster? Amazing I cant even draw a stick figure :/ That's awesome. Like seriously Solid Snake is perfect.  Aaaaand it's been downloaded, scaled up and sent for printing :D

Colouring pencils are on standby. I'm red-green colorblind, can someone help a brother out? I can see what I think to be a couple but am not sure. Nicely done!! Both the idea and execution are awesome! Well done this is epic. mad props I spent way too much time trying to figure out the colors before realizing a colored version was just a few scrolls away. You should cross post this to r/penmanshipporn or r/doodles Ooooh you should look into lenticular printing these onto one poster! (Those pictures where it looks one way from one angle and a different way from a different angle. Think animorphs cover) Anyone else see Waldo first? Is this like engrained in us from childhood?? Kinda super weird..  stoked to see Yooka made the cut Skullomania's in this! I can't find Phoenix Wright there... Where's he?

...he's there, isn't he? What the fuck. How do you make that. You could sell these, if you aren't already. You made this? I can't make a sandwich  People would definitely buy both the colored and black and white version. What the fuck man? Are you an escher reincarnation or something?  That's pretty cool. That's amazing.  [deleted] Found Jebediah Kerman [deleted] You mean you spent a great amount of time making something awesome and it turned out great. Amazing! Thank you for this post.

You've given me so many new ideas for art projects/presents for people.

Very cool. Gotta challenge for you all:

In the uncolored version, find waldo! BC represent! Really cool designs. Hopefully you make some more! Props for Yooka Laylee. Color me impressed. That makes my brain freak out. Holy cow. How long did that take?! I was just thinking, this would be amazing with some color... Scrolled to the next image and then bam! Awesome job dude. As a color blind guy: fuck you, but also thank you for including the colored picture! I want you to know that I appreciate your inclusion of rob the robot. Found Harambe bottom right, god bless Sell this on Etsy This is so damn impressive! This is amazing! Holy shit. I'd think the Steam logo would be more accurate then the Windows logo... but maybe I just like Steam. as a color blind person I appreciate this but my brain also hurts immensely from trying to figure out what the logos were 
 Sweet! Now someone color it! Wow this is fuckin awesome, great job Really nice This is one of the most creative things i've ever seen. Good Job! Loving No Face there. Did not expect ghibli here! Oh man this is super neat op, I would hang on wall! Found Jeb immediately That's awesome. I love it, did you start with the four logos and then fill in from there? Good job OP +1 Upvote Holy shit. Hey /u/Yensooo is metal gear solid in here? Are there just the four logos or is my color vision deficiency getting me again? Huh. That's just about the coolest thing I've seen all year Would definitely buy this in poster form  I'm colorblind, so I can't see the logos, but the uncolored characters are cool! That is super ill! Lit! Wow. Great job! I spent longer than I should have before realizing there was a colored version. That is badass dude.  Awesome Woah this coloring book has everything that I like about games, and TV shows! Unreal work man, this shit amazes me. Takes some real talent and patience. Is that Kit Fisto??  Wait a second.....I don't remember the ^Peanut^butter^jelly^banana^in^a^videogame This is absolutely incredible. Well done! God bless you for showing what it looks like properly colored in. Damn. that's... Really impressive, great job, OP! Wow, this is really good, OP! Really, really cool. Props man Super talented! Love these Is that Pesmerga on the right edge? Fuckin' love it, OP. That's outstanding!! Estimate of how long you spent on this?? Man this is fantastic, just wondering do you have a list of characters used lying about anywhere? Is there not a Fallout character? Make that Nintendo logo float in space by itself and that's a solid art piece dude. Wow man, that is great. I immediately saw Thane from Mass Effect 2! I'd like to see what glitching Queen could do with this both Digimon *and* Pokemon in this... Alright fucker this is cool. I wants it.  THANE is the first thing I saw 💚 What is the dragon thing on the bottom in the center (next to bowser)? Is it a skyrim dragon? Just commenting to find later Colorizebot Noice. Are you a magician? That's incredible That's fucking BRILLIANT composition work. Hey OP, great stuff. 

Question: Who's that awesome skeleton-y character near the upper center near Dr. Cortex's big friggin head? What the fuck  This is actually one of the most amazing things I've seen in my entire life. I'm buying one as soon as I can!  Dude this is epic.... the copious amines of time and effort would have enormous! Would have been at that OCD level if you include only characters from that console within the logo.

Definitely want the these for my entertainment room! This is stunning I love me some iNinja.  This is an amazing & creative work of art. Phenomenal work! Holy shit, that's incredible. ok giving you props for drawing caithe in there. loving how many toons are in here. It's pretty damn cool if I do say so my self. If you're ever going to do this or something like this again, may I suggest you use characters from each platform where they go? You know, have the Kerbal go in the Green for Windows (cause KSP is a PC game), or have Mario in the Red for the Nintendo Cube Logo... where is dreamcast? It's too bad I'm colourblind. I spy Captain Qwark and Clank, but no Ratchet? Hey, I see Sam! Awesome. /r/woahdude 

Awesome work. Amazing. I'm gonna have to stare at it longer.  Guy slightly upper left of center - Crysis?  You are fucking insane. That's a compliment. the fucking awesomeness tho! Very cool Hey! You put Microsoft in there twice!  No way man, your hard work clearly paid off. You're getting mad love from, not to mention much respect. This is my kind of art, I really appreciate people like you that make it possible for me to own art I give a fuck about. Thank you kindly. This is fucking awesome. The hidden logos are freaking awesome! 10/10 good sir. I would buy if I saw in a store. 
 VERY awesome, you're quite talented. 
... 
But where's Master Chief in the Xbox logo? I found Waldo. They're still hidden. Time well spent I would no joke buy a poster size version of this. OP, if you don't mind me printing this for myself could you PM me the highest quality version you have and/or naming a price for the image to print? Damn I love that you included Caithe/GW2 in there! No Face and Darth Vader made this one of my favorite pictures ever. wow this is pretty fucking amazing good job yensoo Yenno, you're very gifted. You gifted person.  Who didn't notice all the logos at first I found waldo, what do I win? I usually hate art posts on this sub amd cringe at the comments praising them but this is actually fuckin incredible. Amazing work. A lot of forgotten gems like I-Ninja, Oddworld, Monster Rancher, and my favorite: Gex. Nice touch with the Luigi being in both colors on the N64 logo Well done OP.  I'm very pleased I didn't have to actually look up any of the characters.  I'm going to guess you're either in your mid 30's, or really into emulating the 80s and 90s games you have characters from.  Though I'm more inclined to think it's the former because of some of the non gaming characters from the 80s and 90s. Captain Quarks face is unsettling. I found Jake the Dog Any SU characters in there The pacman filling both corners of Windows and N64, and the chomp chomp on the bottom left corner of Windows are fantastic! I love the clever positioning! (Plus doctor eggman's pants) I just found Winston Challenge accepted  That would be a bad ass back tattoo You should make a coloring book! Pretty sure I found a swastika on the top left. 
EDIT: nvm it was the Windows logo.  Wow! That's amazing!
 Too cool Green Weepingbell. Seems Legit (sorry to be that guy) is that a swastika in the left ??? Wow this is really cool!

I really want to get the colored version as a poster but I live in Sweden and shipping to here is like $16. Do you have have any ideas on how I could get myself a copy of it here?  You're crazy talented. A-Freakin'-Mazing! =DDD Time well spent, Good Sir! n__n  holy shit dis is nice dude Xbox logo top right...push who needs to color... nicely done on a serious note Togemon! Nice I made this my wallpaper instantly Dude, this is incredible. Well done! OP.  Incredible!  Time well spent! Love that suikoden got a shout out in this Totally worth it! Now i understand why Mario is crying, being stuck in the PS Logo. Colorizebot  Nerd of the highest degree! 

^^^But ^^^I'm ^^^OK ^^^with ^^^it... ^^^Nice ^^^job! Thanks op. I'm blowing this up and having it printed. My wife is big on coloring books right now and you just scored me a badass present.

You should sell this as a poster, I'd buy it. amazing work!   Is... is that Wentworth? And Gold Bone? Wow, I've never seen StreetPass game characters show up anywhere on the internet among others before. That is absolutely amazing! Excellent job OP! Some one get this man a 6 figure salary! That's spectacular.  Amazing.  I am in no position give gold right now, BUT SOMEONE GIVE THIS GUY SOME GOLD! Dude that's fucking  awesome Seriously, Skullomania of all Street Fighter characters? Don't get me wrong I always loved him, but he's from EX, not Capcom proper. Someone please tag every single character in this image. wow pretty amazing Buzz feed is already printing millions and is about to drop them out of a plane above a populated area for free You shouldn't have given it away!! So I was lazy and was hoping there was some kinda 'upload photo, color it online' site out there... and I found one! 

[But it kinda didn't work.](http://imgur.com/kauwf2d) I want this on my wall.  This is awesome. Time well spent.  This is excellent. Top notch. Very well done.  This is honestly one of the coolest things I've seen on Reddit. I like Scorpion's face the most.  where's the cheapest place to get this printed and framed for my wall? walgreens? walmart? really fuckin cool and detailed This is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen  I want a tee!!! Colored of course. I would take a colorable tee even. This is so cool. You have some serious talent. Would you be willing to sell me a copy of this? If possible, I'd like one blown up to poster size. I'm confident that others would be willing to buy a print of it as well. Why not get a little side cash for your insane talent? Whether you're willing to sell or not, I have to say that it's absolutely incredible either way. Cheers m8! This is honestly so cool... Damn this is tight my friend, I wish I had a printer and some colored pencils right about now Is it a bad thing if I can see the logos without color? Also, are you selling this?  The only thing that I can notice without any coloring is the windows logo This is amazing! Nicely done OP I love everything about this.  Holy shit  Yoda is looking really young. * I demand to see with color  oh shit its the peanut butter jelly time dude Very detailed! I want one to color in now  Sonic: oh no guys, I'm good here in the N64 logo section. It's fine... The Last Guardian still isn't out yet. This is righteous. Dats Amazin!!! This is single handedly the best thing I have seen in at least the last 2 months. You are a true treasure to society. Well played sir! That's straight up awesome.  This is insane and I both love and hate your artistic abilities. Here, take all of my upvotes. Man...

You really do great artwork.  
The amount of time it must have taken to plan and execute this piece...

Thanks for sharing it with us OP. 0/10 no dragonborn Amazing! It's is about to be the wallpaper of my laptop
 This here is actually some of the coolest shit I've ever seen man. Oh god, so good This is completely awesome.  I've always wanted to draw something like this but never had the motivation to do it.  Thanks for sharing this! Do you have Battletoads? Actually so sick... well done! Max caught my eye first. Love it.  You didn't list it under your full list of characters, so I'm going to ask: is the digital 9 in the middle right from 'nine hours, nine people, nine doors '? No Gordon Freeman. Still well amazing!  Yes. Yes you did.  Using Captain Qwark to make the Xbox logo seems kinda heretical. This is mind blowing  I am not a gamer and I'm only here because it is a default sub. I looked at the uncolored version and was like, wow, the gaming stuff isn't hidden at all. I can see all the characters. Then I looked at the colored version and my head exploded. What a rip off! Jack Skellington is already coloured in! Thank you for Atari E.T.! That's amazing dude! How long did this take? Normally I'm an asshole but this doesn't suck I found Windows! This is awesome! But /u/Yensooo, is it just me, or is Sora nowhere to be found? D: amazing work thane looks a bit wierd This is amazing. Also, SUPERRRR MEAT BOYYYY! Nice touch putting Aveline from Assassin's Creed Liberation in there, she's a really underrated character Holy shit  Wow, that's totally one of the coolest colouring piece i've ever seen! Great job, OP. This needs more Zangief though!  This is probably the best content I've seen on /r/gaming in years. Congrats! ;) Everyone asks where Waldo is but nobody asks *how* Waldo is.  pretty nice? thats a freaking masterpiece. He's called Wally in the UK.

And what he's called around the world  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F#International_editions Waldo was even in a couple of old games. The first was by Bethesda! Someone should draw a scene with only Waldos, but one of them is someone else. A twist...  *Wally Put it up on a website like Etsy OP after scanning, both the black and white & colored versions, and I'll probably get both. Let me know if this works: http://www.zazzle.ca/alandercoloringpages/products

I recommend also setting up a shop on Redbubble. Larger audience.  Now all you have to do is wait for it to be stolen by somebody more popular than you. It was surely worth the time and effort put into it. He should get gold internet points. Yeah pencil, ink, then scanned and touched up a tad for contrast and then colored digitally. (I used reference pictures to sample the right colors) The t-shirts are already printing. its too late probably around 30 hours all said and done? I don't really time it or anything. I'm not gonna stop you. This version is slightly lower quality but it should work fine for that. 

I am working on figuring out if I can sell prints online somehow that would be using the full res versions but I don't know if/when that would be up. I really don't mind if you print your own, but I did set them up for sale if you're interested. Let me know if this works: http://www.zazzle.ca/alandercoloringpages/products Clank is in there too, a little to the left of Qwark Wouldn't have any effect on the B/W version as it's *only* black and white. It lacks the grayscale information necessary for colorization purposes. u/pm_me_your_bw_pics Colorizebot has been banned from this sub.
[There is a full list here](
http://whatimade.today/two-weeks-of-colorizebot-conclusions-and-statistics/) Lol my first thought too Two others so far: http://imgur.com/a/NOyLJ

And I was going to put don't starve but I plum forgot :/ didn't end up getting him in this one but he's in the sci-fi fantasy one I did here http://imgur.com/a/NOyLJ Snake...? SNAKE...?! SNAAAAAAAKEE!!!!! A friend of mine does a crative night where they like to do crafts and color so we came up with the idea of me drawing coloring posters for them. [This was the first one.](http://imgur.com/4P6GfbW) I got them to give me ideas of stuff to add so it's less pop culture and more people I know and inside jokes. But it was well received so I decided to do more with themes. 

[The second one](http://imgur.com/OzRVnS4) was Sci-fi vs Fantasy themed, and this gaming one is the third now. I didn't even bother looking for him because he's never in these sort of things and then bam, right in the middle of the coloured version. Made me very happy.  It takes a lot of planning. Get the basic idea in mind but then that's why you do everything in pencil first That's exactly what I was thinking. Would've loved to have seen Parappa there too. WAHOO! Or Dankster.



No pic is complete without him. He's in the green part of the windows logo. Don't ask why cause I'm not sure haha I can! lol https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MB3j5hQd446YZTzDGqV16EF5isRdX3ljPOmYUTqfh6E Oh that would be so cool He's working hard for OP. He's about to get sued for this insane poster. I've searched the blue section endlessly and can't find him :(. Kind of ruins the whole thing for me. pencil, ink, scanner and a lot of time haha Took the advice and set up a store. Let me know if this works: http://www.zazzle.ca/alandercoloringpages/products

Hope I helped. Get yourself a pair of glasses for people in your condition. If you can. You muppet. The colored version is in the album, though it's not very well colored, just solid colors. If you're interested I set up a store for prints. http://www.zazzle.ca/alandercoloringpages/products

[Random poster](http://www.zazzle.ca/random_coloring_poster-228661062337427681) Yeah I penciled them in and then tried to work characters into them after. I don't think I got him in this one but he's in the sci-fi fantasy poster I did http://imgur.com/a/NOyLJ Just the 4. Though I do have the Apple and Android logo's in there too but they are just small and apparently like the rest of the characters. I set up a store but the posters don't seem to be showing up yet. I think they need to go through some kind of verification or something. But here's the link in any case. http://www.zazzle.ca/alandercoloringpages/products
 Yeah there's a few characters I took the liberty of adding regardless. Like no face from sprited away. But the peanut butter jelly guy is in all three of my posters, same with waldo. About 30 hours I'd guess Yep! https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MB3j5hQd446YZTzDGqV16EF5isRdX3ljPOmYUTqfh6E Marcus is in the green windows logo part Hydrus from shadow of the colossus  Skullomania from Street Fighter Ex? Yep He's actually in windows logo for some reason, don't ask why haha One trillion dollar$$$.

Still worth it. I set up a store for prints you can check out.

There are two images... one without and one with color. [consistency](https://imgur.com/a/378H2) I had such an amazing nostalgia trip looking at this, thank you OP truly I enjoyed looking at this. Im gonna make it my desktop. You're awesome Glad to see super meat boy in there. Very nice work It's so nice to see Strong Bad amongst these more popular faces :) What about Wizard Whitebeard?  Why can't he or any of Waldo's other zany friends get some love? Went back to check for myself. Well played, OP, well played... Dude that's amazing.  wow So sad :'( that empty smile a freaking masterpiece?  thats a work of art. Yup, also Wally here in poland! Way better name imo. He was in Morrowind, right?  Actually, the final scene in "The Great Waldo Search" is a group of Waldos. The only way you can find the true Waldo? You'll have to pay close attention to the hair...

[Random poster](http://www.zazzle.ca/random_coloring_poster-228661062337427681) these links work, I'd go back and edit your comments that have "sorry no products" I had to scroll through and click each link to see if you ever posted one that worked You should be proud of yourself. This shit is awesome. Very creative.  That is awesome!!!  What should I use to color these? Maybe it is a passion of his, and if it is a passion [nothing can hinder](http://scrolldownandread.blogspot.com/2016/01/what-prevents-you-from-fulfilling-your-passion.html) him from doing so. Feel free to give him some  Holy shit you are a great artist,congrats this looks really good.

as an artist i cant even imagine how much time this would take to make...also i like how you put in alot of classic characters and some that most people forget like wart for example(when i saw him i was like oh he did king k.rool awesome!...oh thats wart oops).

nontheless great job

EDIT: i just spotted king k.rool on the right side....you are amazing...i dont know how i missed it and thank you for not forgetting him like most people do including nintendo themselves Amazing! This is incredibly fucking well done. I know that you already know this and you're being modest, and that's commendable, but seriously, this is fucking incredibly and professionally well done, and you know it. I hope artwork is your living. If it isn't yet, it will be if you don't stop. That's it? Shit, that seems like not that much, considering how awesome it is. Well from what I'm seeing, it certainly resulted in some good work. Getting 'no products' on that page I see the uncolored and colored poster from this post, opened on mobile. I love you Clank, Qwark but no Ratchet to be seen :(
 :_( IS THAT MOTHER FUCKING BIKER MICE FROM MARS. When I get home expect gold sir! Wow. These are all incredible, dude... thanks for sharing. I miss creative nights. We should start them again when summer insanity is over. Also you're Internet famous now. Right on!  Honestly, I find these two more incredible than the one you've just posted. Even though the logos, once colored, are incredible—the amount of detail in these two are remarkable. Dude you are an artistic god...wow. Hey i love these and was wondering if you could do a coloured version of these two, I would definitely buy them! I'm diggin' Mr Poopy Butthole being front and center. You should add these to your original post, they're amazing.  The Sandman was the first thing that stuck out to me. Too dope  Woah even has a Guild Wars Asura in there :O Mr. Poopy Butthole.  Solid. You should make one of those zen colouring books! It's such an underrated game imo.  Awesome answer!  Keep up with your passion! I both detest and am envious of your dedication towards this. I love you! Thanks a lot! Now if only your post could magically go to the very top, because I bet a lot of people will be looking for it. Yup, that's a major overlook... There should be at least a magatama somewhere... Holy everloving shit, I didn't realize that if you color in each character in their proper colors that they're grouped together like that.  Crazy!  You are a mad genius.  Yesss! finally something cool on Reddit I can actually own! Bookmarked though to wait for the poster in question :) Nice! I'll have to check the others out, this one turned out great! You're that guy that circles Waldo... [Check it again against your list n’ see consistency.](https://youtu.be/MvmDAb_TVck?t=1m31s) God dammit where are the other two You actually looked through the non coloured one? Can anyone see master chief ?  Maybe becasue its had nothing to do with Waldo and him being there is just a nice nod? Also probably because most people only recognize Waldo Because if you found even one of them it would make it obvious the rest were there. It's supposed to be an easter egg. A work of art? That's pretty nice. Wally's the original name, I have no idea why they changed it into Waldo for Americans If you post on etsy,  post link on here.  I would definitely buy! I wonder if you'd be able to make them as those velvet-bordered ones. [removed] Agreed op, i as well would enjoy a link! Water mark the original Imgur links too  I'm not sure there's a way to sell this without infringing on hundreds of IPs from some yuge corporations...but good luck There are these pictures that can change depending on viewing angle. This would be perfect for that Also, if you print the design on like a bedsheet, I'd totally buy it 😅 Zazzle actively removes items with copyright violations Will do, thanks! Jeez I'm to drunk. It's my passion to be a drummer but I don't have a drum set. What's your article say about that.  This guy knows his stuff. Not taking away from OP at all, this is amazing stuff. But assuming he has a job/other responsibilities. That's probably about two hours a day for a couple weeks. Not just sitting down for two days straight and not stopping

[Random poster](http://www.zazzle.ca/random_coloring_poster-228661062337427681) ITS BEEN 3 hours and HE STILL HAS NO GOLD! Fraud There's one tonight, if you can make it! Nothing crazy, just colouring while watching song of the sea, but I wanted to get them going again. Definitely! I'm a huge fan of the series and I've gotten quite a few people into it over the years. And I'm delighted about the fact we have a new game arriving soon, even if he isn't the direct protagonist. Knowing me, if I didn't list the character names, I'd put duplicates down.

Should be able to get prints or the digital file here. This is exactly what they should be. I'd buy one of each to color with my daughter.  Let me know if this works: http://www.zazzle.ca/alandercoloringpages/products

[Random poster](http://www.zazzle.ca/random_coloring_poster-228661062337427681) Hey, I bought my first drum set used from a buddy for 80 bucks, and the rest was (unknown) history. It definitely became a passion. You never know! Probably says to go buy one I'd guess. You can hone yourself with such skill even without owning the set. You can borrow, rent, or go to a studio. If you do not want to do that, then you fall under list #4.

Edited: can Sell 50 copies at $20 a pop and that 30 hour "hobbie" seems like quite a nice side job.  Would you be willing to sell the full res digital file? (I would like to get this printed myself). 

Edit : to add - what res is the full file xxYINKxx is a phony!  I'll see you tonight ;-) I did get lazy and do one duplicate of the slime from dragon quest haha Awesome! Trying to redecorate my room for college and I have a spot on my wall that this will fill up nicely :) [deleted] Just like the people who write in my monthly Highlights magazine! You mean you've not listened to Hamilton yet? hooooooooooo boy you are in for a treat Um... Please go listen to Hamilton.   Ahh, thanks :D Hey fucker you changed our airplanes into aeroplanes. My face when Americans call a beef Wellington ensemble with lettuce a "burger."  >Sorry, no products found. There wouldn't happen to be a Kingdom hearts reference that I'm missing, would there?  Zazzle is great, but I've never been able to sell anything on there with copyrighted material.  RemindMe! 18 hours Cool, would you deliver to Asia? I think you should sell prints. Have the printed out custom and re-sell it on etsy. It is more work and bigger risk, but much bigger reward. Sell at conventions also. It works.  ;) Also try society6 That's inspiration man. I have $80 to spare.. :( can't. I tore my acl and minuscus. Been out of work for awhile plus indeed to find a new home What's list # 4 Minus cost of printing on nice paper in a large size and plus the time it takes to make the prints and ship out an order The gaming one is 15600 x 12000. The other two are smaller because I didn't get high enough quality scans of them. But they are around 9000 each. 

I probably could sell you the higher res ones as long as you're not planning to sell prints. I'd rather people get them for free than have other people sell them if that makes sense. A GOD DAMN FRAUD I spotted that! Came to the comments to see if anyone called you out on it, and find you yourself here haha. 
 
  
  If that's what you call getting lazy, consider my mind blown. Great work dude. (Now do those prints ship to China?) I would also like to know...for science Is that still around? That was top shelf at the elementary library. Good luck snagging it first during reading time.  And the sudoku on the airline mags. Instead of tracing it like a decent person. Thanks Tyler Durden... Yeah strange, I'm not sure why they aren't showing up. :/ *fuck it* [deleted] Does Etsy allow copyrighted stuff? check out your local pawn shops. they can be a treasure trove in terms of used instruments.  Well I wish I still had my old Pearl set, I'd send it to you! There are deals like this all over the place, just look for them and do it: http://m.ebay.com/itm/MARK-II-DRUM-SET-/252492892189?nav=SEARCH Even a shitty set or a "junior" kit will get you started ;) Oh, then list #1 applies. [deleted] Procrastination I honestly wouldn't share the digital file with anyone. Even if they seem nice and say they won't try to profit from it themselves; particularly whilst you're selling your own prints. I like your style.  i would also love this option. Just to print for myself. Shipping stuff to where i live (Tanzania) isn't always great.  I was at work lol but a Lannister always pays his debts I don't think you understand science.  I remember signing up for Highlights at a book fair just so i could keep up with those two boys.. Terrance and Truent? Because of chemtrails.  Man, this looks awesome when colored. Good job! I believe the technical answer is no, but in reality plenty of stuff is sold on there with copyrighted characters on it because etsy mostly doesn't police it much. Damn what are these lists users talk about?

Edit: it's all the same user.  I have to get rid of this beer first..   No no no.  What's list # 1 Wow thanks! :D May he does  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I think they are saying that the experience of finding Waldo prompts them to choke the chicken.  I trust this guy's assessment  ........

#Goofus and Gallant you motherfucker! Thanks Obama what is the list tho? It is about money. Biker Mice are a forgotten American treasure.  Thank you for keeping their memory alive. But it's August! When your parents name you "Goofus" you are doomed from birth. You're welcome! Biden was always tasked with public chemical applications. Everyone knows that. He's got a ph.D in chloroform for pete's sake Okay.. So if I'm monetarily broke then maybe one day.? It would actually be really dope if a game used clay graphics, kinda like how cuphead uses it's old school animations.

Edit: thanks for all the recommendations guys :) I'd play it. Take my money!  [deleted] Lee Hardcastle is great. He's done some hilarious and gruesome claymations over the years. All amazing. Just a couple of my favourites

[The Raid](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y_z3EBalwI4)  
[The Thing](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BG33zECv8dc) Claymation takes some serious time and dedication. Kudos to doing this, it's great  Holy seizure juice batman! Under Doom Guy's mask reveals....Wallace.  Epilepsy warning!! I knead this game Source for the gif: https://youtu.be/f8aU4MYDsOQ Reminds me of Klay World GEDDUM LITTLE BUDDY Why, Why can I hear the music!? I don't know what it is, but claymations always creeped me out. All the creatures of hell look so adorable in clay form, I kinda feel bad for them Is this lee hard castle's work? I love the way the shotgun bends when he reloads it. I just want to know why he wasted a chainsaw charge on a possessed scientist  A friend of mine does some pretty awesome/brutal claymation. If you like this than [check out Mr. Oz' stuff] (https://youtu.be/f_MbCW-AU90) [I found the full version.  It's by Lee Hardcastle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8aU4MYDsOQ) Oh man, Mr. Lee Hardcastle. Two of my favorite of his videos:

[Simpsons rendition of film You're Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NT2ZiPIukw) - This was disturbing af.

[Tech Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONKi2S6YBSU) - A super 80s action thing. Set to the song of the same name by this great thick 80s synth style group, Gunship. This got me into their music.

 I immediately started humming the doom music.  What is the name of this so I can support the artist(s)? Amazing. There just ain't enough clay games, right? I don't recognise any of the enemies. I just clayme. who made this? it's awesome! [deleted] Original video with sound Full....
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8aU4MYDsOQ [Jim Allen Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji9qSuQapFY&t)
 this is fucking dope as hell, it reminds me of a tool music video I would pay out the nose to play a game like this! Im getting the feeling that this clip is like that show Robot Chicken I'd play it :D [Artist](https://www.youtube.com/user/leehardcastle/videos)

LeeHardCastle has a lot of great content! My personal favorite of his is the work he did for Gunship's music video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONKi2S6YBSU

Great song and great artwork! Great, now I miss the Neverhood. Wasn't there a crazy fighting game for PS1 that was all claymation? There was like an Elvis guy, and a blob that turned into a buzz saw? Anyone remember this? /u/lastnamewurst How cool!?? Not as good as Requiem for a Tuesday Credit to Lee Hardcastle - https://www.youtube.com/user/leehardcastle 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8aU4MYDsOQ This is actually oddly adorable Probably took days to make, yet is only 10 seconds long. https://youtu.be/TN1BN4keamc Is there a Youtube video of this? Wow, this is really cool. Damn, Ben Wyatt finially finished his clay-mation I had hoped for Cletus Clay, but it never came to be. Lee Hardcastle, great videos loved the Evil Dead ones. Reminds me of "The Neverhood". Just because it was the only clay animated game I ever played. This is really really cool dude! How long did it take to make this?  Am I wrong in saying I found this way more enjoyable than the actual Doom movie? I would plat the shit of this game.  Next time pls include a seizure warning. Those flashing lights are almost as bad as 90s pikachu. holy mother of flashing lights, that physically hurt my eyes Source is [Lee Hardcastle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8aU4MYDsOQ).  What the hell OP, no link to the entire video? 

https://youtube.com/watch?v=f8aU4MYDsOQ Here's the orignal video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8aU4MYDsOQ It's just fiction, right?  This is pretty cool beans.

Who's the creator/what's the source? Wasn't there a clay fighting game for SNES years back? I love this guy's work. Can we raise money on kickstarter to make this a full length film?!  It's DOOMCAT :( This is badass  This is so cool, I always had a love for clay animation, I used to obsessed with Wallace and gromit, we need a new game with clay animation like gears of war 5 and on the plus side, we may actually get to play as Clayton carmine in that one. Well, now i'm scarred for life.  See y'all nerds on the front page! 

This is awesome by the way. 

Also this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gEkNVq1ct0 Anyone know what kind of clay this is?  What brand? Looks like that part in doom 3 when you fall down and the lights are flickering. 4 has good combat but I miss the horror aspect.. I loved 3  This is me in my dreams Epilepsy: clay version.  So cool, I'd give a kidney and my left nut for this. All I want to do is watch old school Primus video's now. bravo
 In the end Actually quite frightening.  Now in 4Klay! oh god my Mister Go pdst is flaring up again And here, I can't even make a decent cup with clay... It brought back a lot of memories  Better than expected That is amazing.  I wish I could upvote you 50 times.

Thank you for sharing that. Holy epilepsy batman. Holy shit. Epilepsy and photosensitivity warning. Almost gave me a seizure. I just woke up and this already made my day. Reminds me of [Neverhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverhood) Damn, i can't even make a snake out of clay :\ It looks like a Tool video Is this from the creators of Killer Japanese Seizure Robots? I would totally play this.  I would play this kinda cute Least disturbing Tool music video ever This is amazing. I can hear the sound effects! Does the real game have that kind of flashing light action?  It's like a tool music video Somebody should make an actual game like that. More or less Clay-fighters, but FPS style. Clay1M1 This is so good! Someone make this a mod for the love of god!  That takes love and dedication! Awesome lil short :) Nice job!
Reminds me of this:
https://youtu.be/y_z3EBalwI4 This is brutal, but oddly charming at the same time 100% accurate I really hope this is largely made with CG otherwise it must have taken a team of a dozen people a month to make with claymation. This makes me want more claymation videogames. This is amazing.  Please don't tell me this is a repost. This one is gem also.

The Thing - Frozen clay edition

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dooAjI6yOhg SEIZUREEEEE this game must happen. someone kickstart this right now I wonder how long it took to make this? Since there's no source, I'm almost positive this was made by Lee Hardcastle  I would play this game Man, now I'm missing [Celebrity Deathmatch](https://youtu.be/am5kQ6uzf9A) Where do I pre-order this? That's actually pretty badass. :D my epilepsy just kicked in... Hey this looks cool, oh, I'm feeling numb, I can't use the right side if my body, uhrph I want this.... nahh I read "Doom - Cake Version" and got really excited For some reason clay gore is the bestest gore.  Doesn't Doom technically already have claymation graphics though? All the sprites were made from clay and latex models, digitized.

[Here's a cool article on gamasutra where they go over the process.](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21405) He just ignores the monster on his right until he is ready to shoot the barrels...here I am waiting for him to take a hit This is so awesome  The Neverhood aka one of the greatest puzzle adventure comedies of all time. Interestingly enough the models in the original Dooms were made out of clay.

[Here's](https://doomwiki.org/w/images/2/2f/Adrian_Carmack_sculpting_Baron.jpg) a photo of Adrian Carmack sculpting one, which would then be photographed, rescaled, recoloured and then animated for the game.

[Here's](https://doomwiki.org/w/images/5/50/Spider_Mastermind_model.jpg) a real life spider mastermind. [Kirby and the rainbow curse!](https://youtu.be/D0uLgdlEBbk) [Platypus](http://store.steampowered.com/app/307340/)

[ClayFighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClayFighter) Skull monkeys  The Swapper uses clay and it's pretty amazing! The Neverhood, great claymation game. There are! Clay Fighter (1, 2, 63 1/3), Clay Jam... and I can't remember the rest. Lol There was an iOS game from way back when that used clay graphics, it was about a ball rolling  down a hill if I remember correctly. BombSquad!  A lot of claymation games I know of have already been mentioned, but I'd also recommend the crazy, out-of-this-world RPG [Hylics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgNUgeEryCM). That game is one of the trippiest I've ever seen. Gang beasts is kind of clay-like. And hilarious.  The things I'd do for a new ClayFighter... Bringing back memories of playing Claymations on the SNES!
 The Swapper, one of my favourite puzzle games of all time, uses hand-made clay models for almost everything, combined with computer effects, to create a fascinating and stunning visual style. Check it out.  Platypus dude 10/10 great time waster See: Bomb squad on Android. The first Diablo was originally gonna have clay animated sprites.   You mean like clay fighter  Armikrog

Another puzzle game. It's weird. I know Neverhood is already the top reply but seriously, try it out =) Kirby and the Rainbow Curse - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uLgdlEBbk

It looks much better when you see it "live" than through a trailer Clayfighter for N64 is first thing that comes to mind when I think of a game using clay graphics, but I agree. It would be pretty badass to see a next gen game with claymation graphics.  I used to love ClayFighter on the SNES when I was a kid. Bert the barbarian! Side scrolling game where you play a Conan like character and go around chopping people!  I'd definitely contribute to a crowdsourcing campaign. As long as I can just hit a button to donate and that's the end of it. Even if a full game doesn't get made it would be worth it as long as he releases tonnes of new animations. I've been burned a few times getting too personally involved in online creative investments and find the best way is to just donate a hundred bucks and forget about it for a year and hope you're pleasantly surprised. Otherwise you find yourself refreshing updates 10 times a day and getting way too stressed out and it just takes over your life.

Its a bit like when you decide to buy bitcoins locally instead of through an exchange. You message a few people trying to get the best rate and you've finally got 3 who offer you a 5 percent markup. One guy offers a case of homemade port wine as part of the deal and that seals it.

You meet of at his gorgeous country estate, give him your address 17q4HGtQSjuthrqWMsPzshyoNKkpmKRyrK and it clears in 10 minutes and you toast each other with a shot of port.

The next thing you know you awake in a beautifully furnished but unfamiliar room. You get up and look for the door but find their isn't one. Just then your twin sister groggily comes too and as you lock eyes you hear a voice come over the intercom telling you not to worry. He's going to let you leave but you must pass a simple test, from a standing position you must ejaculate with enough force to touch the ceiling. You nervously laugh and tell him this is funny and all but just let us leave. Suddenly a computerized female voice intones "26" and you hear a moaning of gears and in an instant the walls contract 3 inches on both sides. Hahaha this isn't funny....silence.

3 hours later the voice intones "25" and the room contracts again. Jesus christ, realizing this lunatic is for real you tell your sister to hide her head under her pillow as you open up your laptop and search for "maria ozawa english interview" on youtube. You watch her done up in a classy dress talking about how shes having so much fun doing tv in indonesia and loves her fans, plus some random broll of her on set in between takes laughing with the camera man, you get a crush on her and almost forget the extreme porn she did before going to asiamoviepass and watching the high def preview of her "dream girlfriends" 30 guy bukkake scene and start furiously jacking off as if your life literally depended on it. You time your ejaculation to the exact height of arousal and see your sister hopefully poke a hopeful eye out of her pillow to spy on your ejaculations trajectory. At first there's hope but it stalls 2 feet short before glumly raining down on the marble floor.

Over the next 3 days you try every combination of pornography and dark erotic fantasy you can conjure, you even try jumping off the bed as you ejaculate before a voice screams NO!!!! And the female voice intones 17 11 as the room contracts almost 2 feet.

Food has been dropped through a hole in the ceiling this time and has enabled you to recover enough to continue ejaculating but by now your room has shrunken from a spacious hotel room to a room young Harry Potter would have found cramped. as the voice now intones "3"

Your sister has long since stopped hiding her head and has instead been watching your beat off with intense hope, though you tried to hide it, you've become involuntarily aroused by her attention and even came within 7 inches of the ceiling once. But 7 inches seems like 7 miles and you've now switched from porn to tentacle hentai in a last ditch effort. You're staring intently at the protaganist being penetraded every possible way in the second episode of Angel Blade before a hand reaches out and shuts the laptop screen as another hand grabs your penis.

You gasp and nearly ejaculate right there as tears fill your eyes and you shake your head "sis no, no!" It's ok, I'm your sister. I'm your sister, I AM YOUR SISTER. Tears fill her eyes too as she kneels and places your balls in her mouth and she removes her shirt and places your hand on her breast as her eyes beckon towards the ceiling. Your horror gives way to pure pleasure and you feel an intense wave relief "we're going to live"....
 Problem is, it would take hours and hundred of dollars to render each frame. Sounds like a job for Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Hah, of course it's by Lee Hardcastle. The guy is awesome.  mew mew... MEW MEW! Thank you  Take yo sauce up Why not just link directly to the YouTube video and give the guy who made it the views Why Does this not have more ups :( His Kill The Noise video is fantastic. The cat with the eyebrows got me. Thanks! I heard [different music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q657rEkgfKs) in my head for the gif, that they only touched on for a few seconds at 1:23.

This is a fucking epic animation. He originally made "[Pingu's The Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAoONl2P8fw)" but the copyright holders for Pingu made him take it down.

He also made [Frozen The Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dooAjI6yOhg) which has been around reddit before. He does good work. But godddamn, if that Simpsons one didn't leave me sick to my stomach. I've never seen The Thing (saw the prequel though) but I vividly remember the first time watching Claycat's version and being deeply disturbed by the scene where three of them are tied up and one is revealed to be the thing. Holy shit, that would be insane to be tied up to someone and find out that they're a monster! Oh yea! He's the guy who made one of my favourite music videos

edit: this one started playing while I was posting. It's actually fucking awesome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71xpQUFgk_k Not to mention this [wicked music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nC5TBv3sfU) for Gunship - Tech Noir. Now I have to go watch The Raid again.  I recommend that movie to everyone and they look at me like I'm retarded or soemthing.  They have no taste I guess. Oh sweet. Edit. These are awesome! Now he needs to do a mash-up of Doom and the claymation from Beetlejuice with the stretchy faces. Taking into account both the creativity and the skill needed to make such a thing really makes you love something like this even more! Rip and tear, Gromit! I think it would be Klaymen under the mask. Alternatively, Gumby. Doughn't tempt me, OP Now that's a name I haven't heard in years HEY DAVEEEE

YOU GONNA EAT THAT SALAD?
 I recently rewatched the entire series. It's so good. Reminds me of Gumby. This is the tragedy of war. Neat. In tbe full version you will.  His name is Lee Hardcastle and this is just a small clip of one of many great claymation shorts this guy has made. Here is a link to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8aU4MYDsOQ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClayFighter Yeah, it's cool, but I couldn't watch more than a couple seconds. Haha I remember getting stuck on that game and never being able to finish it. I was too young to know I could just look up the damn answer. [deleted] I just found a spiritual successor to *The Neverhood*, [it's called *Armikrog* and it's on Steam and this console gen, too](http://store.steampowered.com/app/334120/)  This game horrified me as a child. I don't know where I'd be without Neverhood and Myst / Riven. Those games teach more thinking skills to kids than all the years of school put together. I played this game as a kid once and have been trying to remember the name of it for the last 15 years.  Thank you! One of the reasons I love Reddit so much is that it contains people that have experienced The Neverhood. I know no one in real life that has heard of this masterpiece. Great music, too! Doi doi doi doi doi I member playing this with my dad. It's a really freaky game for a kid, but I loved it The sequel is out now on many platforms called Armikrog.  Thank you for reminding me of this game! Gonna play this tonight. That's my Friday night plan sorted! Yes! The Neverhood is incredible Thank you so much for telling me the name of this again. I've been trying to remember it for years but didn't know how to find it.  I have the soundtrack for this game somewhere. I used to put it in my CD player in the car and confuse the hell out of my friends. "OOHHH JAAAVAAA" Came over to mention the Neverhood!!! That game was awesome. Soundtrack was incredibly cool too. Oh, and it's an early Dreamworks project. :) Holy shit thanks,looks like it's not buyable normally.

Fix for 64 bit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBdUwwzrlMs Is that a nostalgic game you liked when you were a kid or would you recommend it to an adult? My question is, how many apples did you eat in this game?  Fuck you just reminded me of how I lost my Neverhood disk from when it came out. It's worth like $40+ now(not that I'd sell it). That game was so damn good and funny, I grew up playing that game lol.  Never forget Skullmonkeys - the first platformer that caused me to break a controller and make me cry from laughing. Don't forget rhe follow-up, [Skull Monkeys](https://youtu.be/vkrF_P6fet0)! Whoa fucking memories, the whistling music. The Swapper is a gorgeous and incredible sci-fi 2D platformer-puzzle game a la Portal, albeit with a lot more serious story, that used claymation for its graphics.  That is pretty interesting  I never realized those spider masterminds had hands. It must suck to have an itch I did not know this, wow! That mane tho Thanks for sharing this, pretty cool! This is often done in animation, but more as a reference model than an actual product that gets photographed. So, Kiby's made of clay, Yoshi's made of yarn, Mario's made of paper... has someone at Nintendo accidentally locked themselves in an arts and crafts store and this is their way of asking for help? When I first got my N64 the only two games I had for so long were Mario 64 and Clayfighter. I put so many hours into Clay Fighter  First thing I thought of....Bad Mr. Frosty 4 lyfe Clayfighter was awesome! Wow! Thanks for Platypus I totally forgot about this game and I played it alot long time ago! Never had clayfighters but I had biofreaks. I remember it being awesome. It's not:(  Did you read the bottom, about how last march they were gonna reamp the the project, but it was cancelled due to lack of progress because the employees weren't treated well?

What a bummer.  I'm kinda like your dad, and a little like your mom.
There are no monsters here, hey wait, look over there!
I was just kidding, don't be scared.

Edit: 
https://youtu.be/Al0XOLM9FPw Whaaaaaat, I had no idea that was the case! I haven't finished the game but came atleast halfway before real life interrupted me! Oh was that what it was, I found the graphics really interesting and cool.  Clay Jam! It was actually pretty good for a mobile game Thanks for reminding me I haven't installed Clay Jam on my phone! 

Now to rectify that...  Came here to say this! For those who don't know, it's really cool because people can join the game with a smartphone as their controller. I believe you can even play 2 players using just one keyboard, or you can also add players using their phone as a controller (if they get the app which is pretty small I think). So it's kind of a cool idea; you can use a laptop and get a sweet party game going wherever. I've used it a couple times with my team on road trips. Best [clay game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.froemling.bombsquad&hl=en) on the market today! Best party game on the planet. You won't lose friends like Mario Party will.

When you try to tell people to be wary about crowdfunding and then break out into a  bitcoin-buying-gone-wrong-now-it's-about-incest story. I skipped to the last paragraph when I saw how long this was. Definitely missed something important. What? I hate when that happens Dude what the fuck Yeah, it's a bit like that I agree I don't know about you, but I just hit the ceiling. This...things like this is why reddit is amazing  I'm pretty sure this qualifies for /r/bestof but I'm not certain.... How it went from donations to incest is beyond me What did i just read. > I'd definitely contribute to a crowdsourcing campaign. As long as I can just hit a button to donate and that's the end of it. Even if a full game doesn't get made it would be worth it as long as he releases tonnes of new animations. I've been burned a few times getting too personally involved in online creative investments and find the best way is to just donate a hundred bucks and forget about it for a year and hope you're pleasantly surprised. Otherwise you find yourself refreshing updates 10 times a day and getting way too stressed out and it just takes over your life.

Everyone is talking about the weirdness of everything after this bit, but this is absolutely ***excellent*** advice for backing Kickstarters.  If you find a KS that looks good and think the devs can deliver (be sure to research first!), donate and then just forget about it.  You'll either be pleasantly surprised when it finishes or disappointed when it doesn't, but at least you won't be stressed. r/jesuschristreddit Return of Bozarking! Hey man, that's what its like being at the frontline of economic development in an ever more globalized society This is the greatest thing I'll read today. Dude what the fuck? That was awesome I looked the about the first two sentences and then skipped to the bottom. I am never going to read the rest so i shall forever be confused. And wonder how it got there.

The fact that this is your imagination or the fact that you actually took the time to write it out. 

Either way, I am in awe. ok. 


what just happened? Wow. Saved.

To people in this thread, this guy's post history is a goldmine/shitshow, depending on your sense of humor. The fuck? well this guy has some interesting comment history /reddit. 

Log out lads, this website has peaked.  Beautiful, man. Brought a tear to my eye. Yeah... it's KINDA like that, I guess ? Wait... what were we talking about ?  
  
Oh yes ! A crowdfunding for a stop-motion clay version of Doom. No wait, it's EXACTLY like that ! ...more! > maria ozawa english interview

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7NgbP11s-E I have never laughed harder at a comment on Reddit But when do you give birth to her?  Haha yeah it's totally like that. #relatable This happens to you too? GO HOME VARGAS Nonsexual and silly Nah, just build models, textures, and a rendering engine that makes it look like claymation. Not really that hard to do, all things considered. Yeah, I guessed as much as soon as I saw it. If it's claymation and it's disgustingly violent, it's gotta be Lee Hardcastle.

I have no idea how that guy cranks this stuff out, either. He's a beast. Check out this one. Always been my favorite. Although all the videos he's done is worth checking out. 

https://youtu.be/y_z3EBalwI4 Only Hardcastle can do stop motion blood that well :D [Simpsons couch gag](https://youtu.be/_NT2ZiPIukw) There is no unseeing that I knew this reminded me of that for a reason. Not much horror stuff really rattles me, but that fucked me up for the night. I jumped at (well, you know when) The movie is really good, and horrifying. The mutation effects are extremely well done, along with great scene writing like the one you described.  
Do yourself a favor and give it a watch sometime, if you can stomach the psychological gore horror. You should see The Thing. It is fantastic; way better than the prequel You should watch the original then. That's the best scene.  Yeah, I'm like a Parrot on recommending it. I'm probably gunna watch 1 & 2 (side note I love how in no.2, the credits list the 2 henchmen as Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man), followed by The Thing this weekend now "I'm a murderer!" Below lies a battlefield. Barbed wire and hasty fortifications crisscross the landscape. Sandbags, dirt, bodies of the dead and dying have all been piled up in desperate defense. The only places mostly uncluttered by the metal and flesh detritus of conflict are the holes where explosives have torn wounds into the very planet. In the distance, the battle still rages, and the sounds of gunfire and the whine of the mortars can still be heard even over the cries of the dying. In one of the piles of corpses, there's movement. A man bleeding out and trying with the last of his strength to move the bodies on top of him, to die beneath the sky rather than buried in the blood and viscera of ally and enemy alike. His strength fails him, and he falls still. With his final breath, he says these words:

"The true tragedy here... is that if all this were made of clay it would look kinda cute" I rented this from the supermarket video rental store as a kid. Holy shit, that was 22-23 years ago... You're tellin' me. I really wanted to watch it too, because I love the artist. Looking that up back in 97 wasn't that easy.

I got stuck as well and ended up calling people who had finished it to fish for answers. My old man played that game and as I was only around five or six I'd sit in a dining room chair at his side and watch him navigate through it, solving the puzzles like a champ and laughing at the hilarious plot/cinematics.  The point of me telling you this is b/c I can remember he was stuck on a puzzle for days, maybe weeks.  Just plain stumped.  Had to arrange colored lights in a certain way to solve the thing but there was no clear indication of the order they should go in and the combinations were too many to solve through process of elimination.  

Written above the puzzle was this: B.O.B.B.Y. 

So I says, "Blue Orange Blue Blue Yellow" and the old man looks at me, smiling a smile that says *no son, it can't be that easy...* 

It was the combination of course and the puzzle was solved and we could finally move on.

Now I'm 26 and we still every once and a while come back to that game and that moment--still laugh and say, "BOBBY -- BLue Orange Blue Blue Yellow!

Klog go all stinky bad!


 It was that way with me for months. Eventually I got past the mouse door maze and that was pretty much the last puzzle that was just annoying.

I was really proud when I figured out the colored laser puzzle. Undoubtedly the hardest game I ever played through without looking anything up as a child. member Clayfighter? Here's something for the nostalgia trip.

[Neverhood's Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSGk1bQ9rcU) It's terrible and buggy, huge disappointment.  Holy crap thanks for this! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfzWLP2pPE :) A sequel to the game's *soundtrack* came out some time ago. It's amazing:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb551sngpgg&list=PLWIX5HonvKxkY7CioZi3S1W_IbLsn0Eh1 Played with my dad as well. Super fond memories of it. I remember he got a copy of it for me years later and I was floored. So much nostalgia.  It's got mixed reviews on Steam Not really a sequel. Also has absolutely none of what made the Neverhood so good. If you want to know more: John Carmack created a program called "Fuzzy Pumper Pallete Shop" which the artists used to manipulate video of the models.

From the [DoomWik](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Fuzzy_Pumper_Palette_Shop):

"This program was initially used by Adrian Carmack to capture the eight needed rotation frames of his hand-sculpted clay models. The model would be placed inside a brightly lit white box on a rotating modeling stand and then captured through video into the program. The resulting images were "distorted,"[1] and in substantial need of touch-ups. When the clay modeling process proved too slow to be practical, the program still proved itself useful for capturing images of the metal-and-latex miniatures created by Gregor Punchatz. Other items captured included shots of Kevin Cloud wielding various plastic toy guns which became the basis of Doom's weapons, Tom Hall's girlfriend's Eager Beaver chainsaw, a pair of snake skin boots, and a bloody scab on Kevin's knee - the latter two became parts of various wall textures."

If you are interested in the making of Doom and the history of id software I can't recommend the book Masters of Doom enough. We need a tin toy zelda game Actually, Yoshi has a game where he is made of wool (Yoshi's Wooly World), and Kirby had the game where he was yarn (Kirby's Epic Yarn). do you still have the 64 version? worth a penny now I believe Clay fighter was the fucking tits CHEEKUN LEEKUN Git em kitty! Great game. Everyone hated helga right.

I forget who the most rigged/ spammable characters were. Either the Blob, Taffy, or Ichabod Crane. Hell yes. I remember my uncle getting me that for my birthday and how pissed my mother was. Good times.  That game was around in like 2001 right? Hosted on shockwave.com? It's incredible, and you can still download it today, at least on Android. Yes, thanks for the correction! Me and my mom played that game for hours on end when I was a kid. I laughed, I cried, I came. BITCOIN GONE WRONG. GONE SEXUAL.

 u/hobdobbly has the best comment history You sure did.  I had to read it twice through and am still not sure where it went so wrong My boner is confused  Man, don't you hate when you're tryna get some bitcoins and then your sister starts jerkin your gerkin? That deserves a upvote. /r/worstof

/r/wincest Either a copy-pasta, or the birth of a copy-pasta. Yeah, that's..... That's good advice. It's the ***rest*** of it that's the worrying part. How about all week?

I also just read the Anne Frank Prego Porn parody...that was better...but GOD DAMN ~~reddit~~ internet in general, what is wrong with you? Read his comment history. Warning, it's pretty NSFL He clearly said episode 2 not one. Calling on /u/Angelblade2

Edit: omg there's actually an account with that name  Thank you, I feel downright well adjusted now. Minus the comment with the "porn aspergers rant" replace porn with general NEET interests, and I've totally had that shit happen.  Thank you, I loved it, especially the comments about giving birth to women. he's good writer, but history is kind of sad. guy obviously spends most of his time/effort watching japanese porn and hentai. I just want to give birth to you, hnnnngggh!! >_> Stop shitting on my awesome idea to have every frame claymated by hand in a sweatshop. Have you seen his video for [NIGHTMARE?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71xpQUFgk_k) 

His stuff can get a bit cartoonish at times (intentionally so, I guess), but this one's just excellent.
 [Here's how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOajMO4EfxA) Cat raid is also one of my favorite Warning: you think it sounds silly and everyone are just overreacting for the karma. But they're not. Well why the hell did I watch that?! My damned curiosity got the better of me and I regret it. That was awful! Ah fuck. I can't believe you've done this. Classic Chief Wiggum! cgi just doesn't do it like real-time special effects Yeah I heard, and I'm always down to watch whatever Kurt Russell is starring in. I guess I'll just wait until it's on Netflix again. "Calling" people?  I don't understand... Oh, man... This brings back memories of adventure games back in the 1980's. Zork, Ultima, that sort of thing.

If you got stuck, you had to rely on hint books that game developers published. Two stories here:

(1) InvisiClues - a series of hint books that used invisible ink to hide the answers. You used a special marker to reveal them, but only for questions that you really needed answered. The authors would load up the books with red-herring questions and nonsensical answers to deter cheating. Lots of fun.

(2) A gaming hint book compendium - basically, people bundled up hints for solving lots of games, and sold them together. My family had a computer and some games, but not much disposable income - not enough to blow on those kinds of books. So whenever I ran into an unsolvable puzzle, I'd wait for the next trip to the mall, then visit the bookstore and get the hint I needed from the hint book on the shelf. My dad would call up a few times when he was stuck in Tomb Raider. I remember being stuck in a castle in Mario 3, and I called up and told them what castle it was, and they gave me the answer straight away. I tried it out, and I was blown away. These guys were good! That was the hardest puzzle in the game for me, too

So fucking obvious my older brother and his friend were stuck on indiana jones atlantis for hours. when they gave up to go watch tv i started playing around and solved it in a few minutes by whipping the tapir. of course i was kicked off the computer  so they could take over. Oh yeah I member.  Loved that game. The Snowman is the character that sticks out in my memory.  OHHHH I memba' Thank so much for this bro, I just got crazy chills listening to that. The crazy thing is I remember each track and know where a few of them play specifically in the map haha. Fuck they need to rerelease The Neverhood.  That's too bad, because I was hoping for better, also I really like Rob Paulson. Super nice guy. I found it highly enjoyable and had no bugs, albeit it was a bit short.
 The first time I got to the ending he left it completely up to me. I chose the evil option and cried haha.  The Legend of Zelda: The LEGO Link Just checked it on Amazon.  Pretty cheap if you don't care about the box or the special edition.  Special edition is $3000 with the box.  I'm not sure if I should pick up the SNES or the 64 version though. I think there's 2 version. One director's cut extremely rare, the other more common.  Let's get ready to cruuumble! God I miss that game Little girly comboo POO POO CACA [Ickybod Clay*](http://clayfighter.wikia.com/wiki/Ickybod_Clay) I think I got it free from amazon underground That man is on a mission for gold beat it bro

 /r/wincest You can't just mention it without a link! woahhh no give birth to them as fully formed grown women. Im not a sicko! Whoah. That was something else.  Yeah I like the video better than the song. That was amazing. Im not going to lie. When i saw that, i felt some of my humanity leave. Am I just dead inside, or was that not as bad as everyone seems to think it is I'm assuming it's NSFW A simpsons snuff film. You would use the landline in your parents' house to call other landlines where your friends' parents would pick up. You would then proceed to ask if your friend could come to the phone so you could fish for answers.

Alternatively you'd take the bus into town, pick up some games magazine and pray to Jesus that it contained a walkthrough or some cheat codes. You could even call a tip hotline. The number was usually printed on the manual of the game somewhere. For under $1.00/minute, you could call the hotline and they would help you solve the more difficult puzzles.

Being a gamer in the 90's was hard work. You'd lift the receiver off the hook, give the magneto generator a few cranks, then, speaking clearly into the transmitter, politely introduce yourself to Marjorie the operator and ask to be connected to Geoffrey person-to-person.

It's not hard. It's like talk to text, only instead of text its words right into someone elses ear

Imagine FaceTime with no video connection  The amount of social commentary milage south park has gotten out of this trope is impressive and depressing. Bad Mr. Frosty. I was too. Read the steam reviews for the game, they are pretty accurate. 

http://store.steampowered.com/app/334120/ His name was Robert Paulson.  Do a crossover with Paper Mario.
The Legend Of Zelda: The 1000 Piece Link (featuring Dante of Devil May Cry) The sculptors cut was exclusive to blockbuster.  if you have a retron I would grab the snes version.

honestly if you have a retron, you could also emulate the games and play them through the SD card, get that $3000 game on a budget haha.

now as far as snes to 64, I would suggest the snes because I feel fighting games were so much better on there, the only 64 fighting game I remember playing was super smash brothers.  yeah the blockbuster's exclusive directors cut.  Hey you, quit yappin' and keep fappin'! Cum on the ceiling too [Here you go](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5dbquj/what_are_some_nsfw_history_facts_that_do_not_get/da3j9m0/?context=1) Did nothing for me. Couldn't even get hard. 0/10. Idk I think it's the iconography of the Simpsons. It's a cornerstone of American culture so seeing something that's so startling violent involve the Simpsons is probably made 2x more unsettling if you grew up with them It's soft emotional music played over legitimately disturbing gore.

So, yes. Dude its NSFL, this shit is the worse thing I saw in my whole life. From the bottom of my heart I say: dont watch this. But you can always ignore People on the Internet  Exactly! I got kicked out of the local Blockbuster because I would go in and copy cheat codes from the code books. There I was, flying down on my stomach, pencil in hand, transcribing the entire book by hand like a Franciscan monk. Every christmas on my list was for a  year subscription to NINTENDO POWER for that reason! The fuck is a landline? Yep, in the South if your friend was a Jr.  You'd ask for 'Little <insert name here>"

Is John there?

> Big or Little?

Little.
 I'm so glad that the elder millennials showed up to this thread to comment. The struggle was real. I'm old enough to remember what the world was like before being able to just Google an answer. But young enough to have been shown how to use the new technologies as they developed.  this is the part of my childhood i really do not miss. I remember when GTA Vice City came out. I made a promise to myself never to use a cheat code ever again. After I beat it, I knew I could do anything. Then GTA: SA came out and that goddamn dirtbike could never keep up with that train no matter what i did. I don't play video games anymore, but I did beat 4 and 5 on my own just to maintain some sort of balance inside my head that I don't need no Gamepro magazine to help me through life. You'd have to wait until someone was off the dialup internet first.  Dude, you're making me feel so old.  > pray to Jesus that it contained a walkthrough or some cheat codes.



And demo discs.

Ooh those were the days. > Alternatively you'd take the bus into town, pick up some games magazine and pray to Jesus that it contained a walkthrough or some cheat codes.

When MOrtal Kombat II came out I went to the local store to copy the moves list off the magazine.  

I had a notepad and pen ready. 

I get there and every single game magazine had that section ripped out =( They also had a 1-900 line for game tips (well, a lot of game companies did at least) 


I remember when I was like 9, I couldn't beat this race level on Interstate 76, no matter what I did he'd always beat me. I called them asking for advice and the dude was finally like "well.. Ermm.. If you can't outrace him, you should just use this cheat code to skip the level...." 


In essence, I paid like $5 for a cheat code (it was worth it.)  I once read about a 'tip-line'. I imagined there would be a dude on the other side who played games all day long until he beat them all and gave people tips about how to advance. That seemed like the best job in the world to me and that was gonna be my future. 

A couple months later I got stuck in a game and called the guy. I was pretty disappointed when I found out that it was only a tape and it didnt even have tips for alttp, but since i was already calling i went for a tip on dkc, a game I didnt even have.

Still a shame, seems like a legit career in this day and age. I miss it, though. Before you could Google (or rather, AskJeeves or Yahoo or Lycos) how to beat a game, you had to figure it out. And it was super-satisfying to know you'd figured it out yourself. Many games were *hard* too, you get get stuck for hours or days. 

It's a shame now that any bit you can't beat in a game is solved by a quick search. Automated switching happened because the guy who invented it ran a funeral parlor and the operator kept connecting people to his competitor because operator was competetor's relative. I have the Sculptor's Cut version. Don't have the box, unfortunately. I had no idea what it was worth until recently! Sculptors cut was amazing!  I need to play this again soon. Just got a retron last week, I had no idea it emulated off SD too.  That's awesome.    Yeah I think it has way more to do with a family we all recognize and that a lot of us probably *love* in a way being brutally murdered.  Haven't seen the drug cartel chainsaw decapitation I take it? Eh, I say watch it. First time I watched it, I was mortified, but now I can keep watching it over and over and it's just awesome how Hardcastle was able to achieve that. It's pretty depressing, and also really gross, but it's all clay. It's really interesting to me. If you like to observe people's wonderful use of their talent, this is it. This guy has scarred people using *only clay and dyed water*.  I'm imagining a young person laying down on a skateboard "flying" around the blockbuster while copying down cheat codes.
 Blockbuster had cheat codes? I remember the game consoles, but actual cheat books seem out of place. Are you sure you weren't kicked out for flying inside the store? Other customers kinda don't appreciate kids whizzing around the place. Flying down on your stomach? FLYING?!?!? Hahahahahaha Are you sure you weren't kicked out for flying inside the store? Other customers kinda don't appreciate kids whizzing around the place. Why didn't you take a picture using your smart phone?  My friend didn't have Internet back in the day. We both played a lot of the same games. He used to call me all the time and I would tell him the codes over the phone for years. Cue the fax machine a while later and it was a cheat code exchange utopia. I would print them out so I would have a copy and also fax one his way.  Basically two cans connected by a piece of string. A cellphone without a battery, so it has to be plugged in 24/7. I don't get mobile reception at my house.  Still got a landline, funnily enough. Little john? Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!
 Am junior. Can confirm.  I was about to rant like this so hard. Doesn't it feel like we were shown how hard life was and then they just internet-ed our life into the new century?

-Born 1990 kid Amen. Having to leave your Nintendo on for your dad to get home from work to beat something for you because you couldn't. 

Even in maybe like 99-00 before Walkthroughs became a big thing. You had like CheatCC where you could pick up a few codes, but you couldn't just Google "Pokemon Sun Abra Loactions" and find out where you needed to go.  Yeah. I remember running out to my dad as he came home from work yelling and bragging that I had beaten Quake 1 before him.

I had used /impulse9 (all weapons) and /noclip (run through walls).

He was not impressed. Nintendo used to have Game Counselors.  On the other end of a pay per minute 800 number were people who practiced games all day and had reference manuals to look up answers. Now everything has a waypoint system as well, making finding important locations trivial. I remember a quest back in vanilla WoW that gave info on landmarks you had to follow to find a NPC somewhere in the woods. Now it just puts a marker on the map.  That's great ingenuity. A lot of people would just sue. Not invent.  yeah and runs language translators too..so if you get a game from japan in the super famicom, you can play that game as it is and the SD card would run the translator to change ti from japanese to english.

you can play earthbound and dragon quest with their japanese versions and other games that didn't make it to the states.

i'll have to do some digging myself I haven't done it yet, still on sega's castlevania. 


edit:

i'm talking about retron 5 here.  I have no problem in browsing r/watchpeopledie all Day, but this level of clay violence is too much for me. I don't fucking know why That's exactly how the 90's were. Everyone just belly flying on skateboards. Yeah, have you never seen a comprehensive cheat book? They used to be everywhere even up to the early 2000's. They had nearly every mainstream game in them separated out by console with all the cheat codes.  Connected by a series of tubes. Finally! I don't have to lug this cell phone around. Sounds awful If it was wired, it works without electricity, which always fascinated me as a kid. The power goes out and you can still call people. This is one reason why people with landlines, might have a wired telephone stored away while the rest of the house uses newer wireless handsets. ew why? WHHHHAAAT? I'm glad I got through high school without social media being a thing. I can only imagine the idiotic "deep" shit my 15 year old self would have written.  Yeah, I get why your saying. I think us older millennials appreciate the technology more because we remember life without it. Some of these younger kids now just take it for granted. Dude, yes. I couldn't agree more. I'll never forget getting on AOL for the first time lol

(1993) yeah doom always made me mad with that. in the first one it was idspispopd and in the second one it was idclip. I was always so angry that they couldnt have just made the first one that easy as well. I dont know why it still infuriates me to this day. So the job really existed, dope. Where is Mankirk's wife? this marked the end of WoW for me when they first implemented it 6 years ago. In the beginning you actually had to pay attention to their directions, then all of a sudden they put you on a rail I'm totally the opposite. A real person could just like, get their leg blown off and be in shock and that'll stick to me for the rest of the day. But this clay thing didn't do a thing to me, besides just being kind of sad.  Only 90's kids remeber  When they weren't slamming pogs on their friends punk asses you mean... Where's the meme on this? Still have an old game Genie book for the NES. Pages and pages of arcane incantations (aka strings of hex) to make everything easier.  My brother and I used to print out a list of codes for GTA San Andreas. Some fucker at our school even tried selling those codes like people couldn't find them online. Tangled up tubes.  It puts the lotion on its skin.... Next thing you're gonna tell me is that there is some kind of booth with the landline inside in public areas. Oh, Hermes... Should we tell him about how rotary phones worked? it gets worse. you couldn't plug it in the mains socket, it had special wires with special electricity in them. It doesn't work without electricity, it just pulled power from the phone line.  Phone lines are a different circuit from three phase power distribution that powered the rest of your house. I hope my high school Myspace blogs are buried so deep in the net that they can never be found again. I have so much idiotic shit to atone for that randomly crops up on my time hop. Count your blessings.  I always like googling myself to find 13 yr old me posting on his xanga. It was some seriously emo shit. Always makes for a good laugh.

Edit: apparently Xanga is gone. Rip. No more laughs. I was in high school when Livejournal came out. Basically everyone had one - god, I'm so glad that mine got deleted due to inactivity, and I never put my name on it, just an (old, not this one) handle. Really, and all your most embarrassing moments recorded on a cell phone and uploaded to YouTube so they can haunt you forever. I'm glad I grew up before all that shit.  >"Meh, kids these days! They take everything for granted!" -us

Damn son, I guess we old as fuck now.  Edit; Looked it up real quick, I might not even be a millennial. Guess I didn't know what it really meant lol

I'm like smack dab in the middle of being an "older millennial" and young one. 

I'm 18, so I had a smart phone in my first year of high school. But I do remember what it was like having to get off the computer so my parents could make a phone call or just how hard it was trying to load up a walkthrough on Gamefaqs because it would take forever. 

However, I've had google at my fingertips for basically my entire life so it's not really the same to you guys, but it still boggles my mind seeing 6th graders walking around with a mad nice smart phone in their hands. I got my first flip phone (which was a handmedown) from my mom in the 6th grade. Meanwhile all my friends already had the iPod touches that were first coming out lol 

Idk why I'm even telling you this lol, but I guess it's fun to remember being on both sides of the spectrum. Having the luxury of internet my entire life but also remembering what it was like going to school (at least early on like elementary and middle school) without all this crazy ass technology+dialup internet. I definitely appreciate the technology that's been made available to me.  My little bro's the same age. That little guy came on to technology late though. I'm not sure if he ever used AOL. WONKkaWAAAAAA-beeeeeeeee-kssssh-beepboopboopbeep-KSSSSHHHHHH!!!!!

 I remember being *really* frustrated with quite a few WoW quests where what the quest wanted, and what the description stated, were not always in sync.

Abritrary, but probably not accurate example:

Go collect 15 raptor tails from the raptors near X. 

"Sweet, this should be simple".  Except there were multiple groups of raptors near X, and only one group actually dropped the quest item, but you really couldn't tell the difference between a bad drop rate on a quest item versus the wrong group.

They weren't all that bad, but there were enough of them that I finally said Eff it and found an addon that would show me the right area, because the alternative was constantly alt-tabbing to thotbot or wowhead. What are you working on?

I'm linking cells. Oh! This brings back memories! I used to do this a lot in school some 6 years ago! Never did any original art though.

EDIT:

File in a .rar: http://puu.sh/sF1kH.rar

Also includes my math homework and some other stuff. This is EXCELlent Looks great, but isn't Death Mountain east of Hyrule Castle? This is spectacular! How long did it take? I honestly have never seen something quite like this before. I didn't even know you could do this in excel lol. I want to know what's on the first two sheets! I used to make excel games. Made checkers and connect 4. Saved the file in a shared folder and would play with coworkers.  That's a cool picture of Zelda! Take it 18 steps further (ok not even that many, it's easy) and program games in excel.  It's fun and makes you a bonafide wizard with excel in almost everyone elses minds. "pc has no good exclusives" Have an upvote for using your spare time productively creating something awesome! Hey, [so did I!](http://i.imgur.com/V2A2m3n.png) Better than the Japanese guy that painted his whole Masterpiece in Excel though? [Epic Art in Excel](https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/5g4xki/77_year_old_man_cant_afford_photoshop_creates/?st=IWBJYN39&sh=e24a00bf)  Who knows, but this is definitely a contender. Great job! r/pixelart is calling, my friend. TIL you can paint in excel  Did you excel at painting? You should be fired. 

Edit: Spending hours painting in excel could get you fired, if caught. Stop asking "why?" - obviously you've never had a job above retail. You could always be doing something, don't give me that shit. 

Edit 2: I guess I don't know what I was expecting. Trying to talk about corporate work ethic to /r/gaming is about the worst idea I've had in a while. Good luck to all of you in the future, keep doing you. It makes it easier on us for hiring purposes.  How the hell do I get a job where I'd have this much free time? My free time doesn't have this much free time.
Awesome work btw. The comments on here made my day.  Great pic but that 2 pixel star gots to go I did this sort of thing once, not to this extent mind you, this is quite good!

I made an employee directory in Excel for the whole company (they didn't have one yet?!?!) It got passed around to a lot of other employees in all different departments, and I feel really sorry for any poor soul who tries to print that spreadsheet for easy reference. I got bored one day and recreated a 'Wake Up Neo-'esque screen (from the Matrix) a few thousand cells away from the top of the spreadsheet, far to the right of the bulk of the data. If I tried that, my excel would complain that there are too many cell formats. Sad to think you're working in a field where your talents aren't best being used. This looks fantastic.  Damn!! You're excellence in excel is great.  Send the file to your boss This is amazing! We're still going to have to let you go. You must really EXCEL in your field of work to have so much free time. Looks like Zelda for MS-DOS.  These would make great cross stitch patterns! What job do you have? How can I also get a job where I can waste time on the computer for hours on end and get paid? (I'm not attacking your job, sorry if that sounded rude) bro wtf i can't even organize numbers correctly this some bullshit Terrible. Poes don't show up until you're an adult. Hey! 

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

Listen!

I'm going to need you to come into work on Saturday....  Thanks for posting that link! great work! I am going to think about this every time I stare at a spreadsheet. Someone animate it within Excel what happened to sheet3? hey it's me ur boss Reminds me of old-school [ANSI art](http://www.digitpress.com/columns/images/bbs_80.jpg). Well done >slow at work

>paints masterpiece **in Microsoft EXCEL**

Lemme know if you get fired/promoted/demoted for any reason because I badly want your job. [cities](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/MtoWo)  Linked Cell You must work at a Hollywood Studio.... or a government agency. What is your job title/industry? Fucking slow indeed... Nice work, though. Death Mountain is on the wrong side of Hyrule Castle. Other than that, nice.  jesus...how slow does it get ?! Well, congratulations... this is going to be a thing this is awesome. /u/mar7967 - what job code does this get charged to? Excellent I loath using Excel and here you are having fun with it Well you've just improved my procrastination game - thanks! You've really Excel-led yourself  I used to do this in MSPaint, I'd zoom in 800%, select the smallest pencil tool, and voila, I'd do pixelart  Have you heard of mspaint?  I think you'd like its zoom mode What would be even cooler is if you wrote a macro to do this. Click run macro and watch it paint.  Nice! But you got way too much time on your hands.. You excel at painting! Here's something: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2QQHlQ_I This must be how Minecraft started.  I barely have time to eat lunch at work and this guy is fucking painting in excel.  Wouldn't it be infinitely easier/faster to just use MS Paint? As our president would say, "You're fired!". We used to call this ANSI art They pay you to do this? Are you going to bitch when your department is outsourced? Makes me nostalgic for the days of 8-bit glory.  I wish I had some sweet office job that let me do nothing but browse reddit and paint in excel all day.  I can almost see this being a cutscenes in one of the original games Can you explain the process? Well I have been looking at Reddit a lot at work. Might start doing this. Also very slow at work. well then keep it up because your sprites look adorable [deleted] This is kewlio. 

But ... Why did you screenshot the picture instead of just saving it and uploading it? I kept trying to scroll in the image until I realized it was part of the picture.  You have slain 2 bokoblins....
You have slain 3 bokoblins....
That is a difference of 1 bokoblins.  Amazing!  I can barely do one calculation in that program!
 This makes me wish later versions of Excel had kept [Dev Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGZfuwsvIFQ) as a hidden easter egg. Did you color each individual cell or did you set up conditional formats for 12 or so colors so you only had to type in a number?  Upload the spreasheet to dropbox for us. Dang what do you do? I want that job! That's crazy I wish my work was that slow. poe, nice choice What's ur job This is amazing. Great job Gee whiz what job do you have lol mine has such little down time i hope this was recorded as a macro I've recently started doing the same thing, I have a pixellated Nick Cage I'm especially proud of.  I didn't realize that you could paint in Excel.  He is playing on Master Quest mode since Death Mountain is on the left side this is fantastic I don't think I've ever seen Toon Link in Hyrule Field fighting a Poe with Navi. Interesting.  Neat How many lifetime did it took to complete this? A reddit upvote thing.  Not worth your time. You know, they have Microsoft Paint.... Damn Dude you got skillz I love it more than anything! :D My heart!  Joke's on you, Link's left ha - oh.

 I love the artwork! But I gotta ask... how fucking slow is your job where you have time to pull this off?  How do you paint in excel!? Great pixel art  Will be bored at work tomorrow. Challenge accepted. Its Tabulous more detailed but it dates back at least a decade to Mortgage pig

http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2008/11/happy-thanksgiving.html what the fuck! this is fucking amazing best use of excel ever
 As someone who loves spreadsheets and attention to detail, I love this Excel art but the bad [jpg compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos) is making my eye twitch... Whats the hight and width for the cells to be 8-bit? Do you want more work! That is unbelievable  You should get a second job with all that spare time. I created a [comic for nerds](https://comic.browserling.com) and made all my comics available in Excel Art format. Here are examples:

https://comic.browserling.com/25.xls

https://comic.browserling.com/45.xls

etc.

I currently have 64 comics and you can access them all from `1.xls` to `64.xls`.
 I use Keynote to draw illustrations and stuff, but this went past even my skill. :D Windows 7? Dude I want  your job!! What do you do?  This is great. Except that I feel like Death Mountain should be on the right. Now I have something to do tomorrow thanks op.  There are scripts that convert images to excel sheets.  I didnt realize zelda was a lefty. Amazing work, how long to take it? What do you do? Linked Cells. Nice.  Now do it with pivot tables. Can you create a VBA script that take a pic and converts to Excel paint? Just asking. Looks like Point n click adventure game G I don't know whether to thank you, or bitch at you... because I'm almost certain this will now be the way I'm going to get fired. You should get that woven like a tapestry :D Relevant
https://youtu.be/UBX2QQHlQ_I Reminded me this one my friend made: 
Excel of Cities [](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/MtoWo)  Now use some hidden numbers and conditional formatting to animate it. God I wish it was that slow at work.  Can you link to a blank xls sheet file.  It's like 2D minecraft  Op:I'd straight up buy one of these printed on canvas.  Death mountain is on the wrong side Now print it! That would come out so massive! Are you rock hard, rufi0h Your rows are magnificent but your columns lack conviction. Hey can u send me the file I can convert it to vb script and do stuff with it. Thanks!  Extremely slow apparently  [This Japanese artist took excel art to the next level.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1YnwWgpEyw) This explains my unemployment  Better than excelling in Paint I feel like a .BMP paint creation would be easier/make more sense... God I miss having s job that gets slow. I still dream there are a few out there you can live on. How the F? How do you even do that lol. That's so cool Lumbridge castle The stars are perfectly spaced. If I made that I would've obsessed over the star placement and then rage quit when I couldn't get T perfect  >sometimes Wish work was that slow... This is beautiful.  Do you happen to work at self-employed inc? Lmao it's so good 😂 The fact that I haven't thought to do this makes me feel like a failure of a procrastinator.  *art.xlsx* LOVE IT! Zelda is def the best nintendo game period. Then comes smash brothers.  Very impressive What do you do that allows for this much time??? Excelda That is a very inefficient company  I used to make color by number via spread sheets for my elementary students. Love this. Nice work! Let the record show that I hate excel. How slow? I wish I had that much free time at work. How long did it take you?
 Could someone code Zelda in excel??? Reeeeeal slow. Where do you work?  Painting Excel ?? WTF ? And i am here trying to copy a table next to other one without fucking up the column sizes. You know, one thing I am really scared of is being at a job where I am paid not to do much.  I don't wanna know how much you make to sit there and do this lol Can you send me this excel file?  Resume: Master level proficiency in Excel. Administrator of a 4.3 GB Excel file extending to column "JJJJJ" and totaling more than 5 million populated cells.  I used to do the same thing, but on a smaller scale. Use macros, and you can switch outfits with a click of a button.  Is your job a graphics artist?! Wow, that is slow Okay now make a game out of it
I will buy it I've found excel is an excellent software to plan pixel artwork for Perler Beads. Nice job. I love how people can make excel do things that it was almost certainly never designed for. Would this have been easier/more practical in something !Ike paint? Almost assuredly. But then again many excel databases that I see would also be much more practical in MS Access. Damn. How slow was it?  NIIIIIIIICCCCCEEEEEEEEEE I'm inspired.  I start this tomorrow. Now im curious how many hours it took and how much they pay you per hour to know just exactly how much this would theoretically cost. I'm so curious what happened to "Sheet3".... I wish I had your job How long did this take? [this](https://youtu.be/V-_O7nl0Ii0?t=18s) is a great tutorial on how to do this type of painting.  That's very punny! Brilliant. http://m.imgur.com/DRVRZGs?r Anything Earthbound I will upvote!  Those are amazing and look exactly like the in game sprites! Wow, when viewed on mobile, the grid does this visual effect thing  when zooming in and out of the images! Great work, next time make the borders clear. The lines are really bothersome.  Foobar2000 represent! Best music player ever!  Whoa, nice touhou sprite. Gotta play more of that great fighting game. 6 cells per pixel... why... Got some windows open I see. You like torrents also.  fucking awesome - I had no clue  Upvote for Kraken. Love the design, never played the game though. Wow, second time upvoting anything related to Touhou today. And accordingly plugging /r/Touhou. +1 for Touhou
 Man I miss MSN...  lots of torrenting too why use excel if you have photoshop? It hyRULES! I thought that was a pointless comment, but then I understood the Link. It looks really neat.  https://youtu.be/UBX2QQHlQ_I Fuck you Word. [happy now?](http://i.imgur.com/WxqnWWc.jpg) Came here to say this, that ghost would indicate this is Ocarina of Time in which case you're right. It's a great picture though and this small detail doesn't detract from that at all, it's just a funny way to take the piss out of OP. Surely you can be east or west of death mountain and still face hyrule castle? It's the Gamecube version It is East. This view is at the rear of the castle. That's the back door.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRsPheErBj8 how do you know we're facing north? about a day in a half.  It looks like he's just changing the background color on each individual cell, treating them as pixels. It's pretty neat. Dude you didn't see that top post a few days ago? This old Asian dude who couldn't afford photoshop used excel to make really badass portraits of flowers and shit.  It's hard to think of things you *cant* do in excel. For the uninitiated - isn't it easier to do this kind of thing in 'paint'? Why use excel in the first place? There are even programs to convert images to excel files.  Here they are. I did the first one when i was board and screwing around, then i thought maybe ill give it a real try. 
http://imgur.com/a/aqKkj Excel is my preferred game engine. Can do a lot very quickly.

Some of mine:

https://carywalkin.itch.io/arenaxlsm

https://carywalkin.itch.io/candy-number-crunch-saga Me too, I made a battleship workbook years ago,wonder if it's still poking around. I think Legend of Zelda is a pretty cool guy. Eh time travels and fights Ganons and doesnt afraid of anything. Let the hate flow! You mean Metroid. His name is Metroid. Triggered! Difference is pixel art vs vector art I used to just paint in MS Paint, how trivial of me. I don't disagree with that  You're trying to be funny, right? He's in a call center so I wouldn't be so jealous "guess how many hours you payed me to do this!"  Yeah, but then you'd have to put up with Carol from HR.  
*Pfft*  
Fuckin' Carol. i resize all the rows and columns to the same size, in this case 7x7 pixels. then i go in and fill each pixel in with a solid color.  He downloaded a [excel pixel art generator](http://williamjeffreyharding.com/dataprocess/PixelArtGenerator.html), exported a believable low-res image, then [pulled a reddit](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/56/6a/8b/566a8be0b2d6d89cb01ef61bc109ab9e.jpg). http://imgur.com/a/C1haY get out D:< You should be pun-ished. Just beat the game for the first time today, can confirm. Fought that kraken a few hours ago, spot on. I'm still waiting for Earthbound 64.. Earthbound Called the moire pattern! Hey! You were right! Also: [looks much better in 2016 in actual excel](http://puu.sh/sEB4M.png)!

 "great work" proceeds to nitpick on several year old art tbh i prefer it with less clear borders. gives it a nice style I still use it to this day! Really is the best! Amarok! most of its games are danmaku If I remember correctly... I did this because open office (at the time) couldn't resize cells into perfect squares (at least I didn't know how), so my solution was to use multiple cells to create a semi-good square. Not perfect, but it worked at the time :) 8 I vlookup to this artist Dad? Quality LINK! I thought u were saying about his joke then I realised you ocarina of time Tldr Guy is annoying as fuck..... Amazing! Thank you for the share.

More historically accurate  Yeah it's certainly awesome nonetheless. Also the windwaker style Link :( [deleted] And face the main entrance to hyrule? I don't recall there being large entryways on anything but the front. Given Hyrule's map, you actually can't. Master Quest is only mirrored in the 3ds version, the GC version is left the same. We seem to be in Hyrule Field (south of the castle) and see the front gate of the castle that faces southward. Wow, your work really *is* slow. Is this .5 days or 1.5 days? In a half of what? I want your job... Exactly. I just resized them all so they were square  I bet it would be pretty easy to write a macro to convert a picture to a spreadsheet. I might try that if I get bored at work.  Anybody have a link? That's awesome. Somebody found the same pixel art monkey that I did! http://imgur.com/Et5YWmN (my vday gift to my fiancé) Oh wow, the contrast between those two reminds me of the owl picture haha  The second is beautiful. But what's on Sheet4? Nice shading on the tree. Before anybody says anything, Bored. The first one would be me trying... The second sheet is really good, but seriously that leap from your first sheet to the third / one you posted is ridiculous. wow how do people do this shit, nice job You made me waste the entire monday morning on arena. Thank you. This is awesome.

Good storywriting btw. I'm hooked. If I'm too trash to finish it I may come back begging for tips. Gamons  It's an older meme sir, but it checks out. Great response  Why? Someone has to staff the phone. If they don't have something for you to do between phone calls, they're paying for your presence. Not really, I work in operations. My jobs a logistical type so if everything is running smoothly I don't have a lot to do. My job is to react when it goes poorly. There is no Carol in HR! Alright, here it is: http://p.ahkscript.org/?p=927c4aab

Run that script with AutoHotkey. Click the top left corner of the picture you want and drag like you do with the snipping tool to the bottom right corner of your picture.

It will save VBA code to your desktop that you can run in Excel. I would have done that step with COM but AHK didn't like the RGB() function.

It isn't going to handle anything bigger than an icon. And it's very slow. Maybe I'll improve it :P He was leaving anyway... because the princess is in another castle.  Yoshi'd be punished. Word? Man I wish I could play this game again....sadly dont know how to find it! [removed] Is earthbound fun? http://i.imgur.com/fBO1WZz.png Holy shit that looks awesome dude! 👍🏽 I'm more impressed by the fact that you actually took another redditors advice and it actually looks 10x better. [deleted] If I wanted this I'd go talk to my boss Yeah but look how much better it looks when all it took him was a simple excel format change... I mean, I wouldn't call clicking a check box nitpicking art but to each their own. Yep, played them all minus 14 and 15. Just so happens that 12.3 and 14.5 are my favorites.  [deleted] Even worse, so small I can't count em lol Pivot table. My thoughts match yours as well.  Perhaps we should start an index of all these 'comments?
 This pun thread is the SUM of all my fears Epic reference Every picture is actually just a spreadsheet. He took a picture and denoted every pixel to its numeral between 1(black) and 255(pure color) in red green or blue and copy and pasted it into Excel. 

Then spent two days setting the conditional formatting because, turns out, excel was not designed for that.  Just pretend that it's wii [jeez are you people ever satisfied](http://i.imgur.com/k8Uh2Sm.jpg) Actually, it's not. In the SNES version, he keeps the shield pointed towards death mountain out of superstition. 

(Also, to save on sprite memory.) I knew something just felt wrong about it but didn't know what. you know, i never noticed Link uses his sword in his left hand... dont you normally use your dominant hand with a sword? if so, that means Link is left handed, which is kinda cool.

*EDIT* found this:

"Link is left-handed. However, for Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, they switched Link to right handed due the the fact that an overwhelming amount of gamers are right-handed. So in use with the Wii Remote, it made sense to make him a righty. Take a look at the GameCube version of TP, Link is still left-handed." the sound of hundreds of Zelda fans suddenly realizing that Link is left handed.  Er. But isnt his sword by default in his left hand? Okay, happy [now?](http://imgur.com/a/mw5O0) Hero mode It's a secret back door  It's the back entrance to Hyrule castle. It looks just like the front. Just go with it.  Depends on the Hyrule map. For instance, in Twilight Princess, you can enter Castle Town from both sides, as it's circular and in the middle of Hyrule Plains.  I cannot believe I sold my copy of masters quest for gamecube along with some other version that came in a silver box. Last I heard they are worth money. Its just the slow season for us. I have to staff a phone, if it doesn't ring, there isn't a ton for me to do.  Are you actually him? [deleted] How exactly do you resize them and to what exact size if it's in pixels or length for perfect squares?  [Fine](http://www.graphictip.com/2016/11/27/amazing-art-done-excel-77yr-old-man/)
But OP is gonna feel all upstaged now
 I came here hoping someone else had the link, as I missed the article when it was on the front page due to the Reddit hug of death. Oh, well, to the search bar I go...

https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1g59x2/a_76yearold_japanese_man_makes_beautiful/ Oh yeah, i just googled pixel animals and tried to replicate it.  That monkey is from Yoshi's Island btw We don't talk about Sheet4. I remember one of my friends made a real-time skateboard game in PowerPoint. It was a long time ago, so no pics. :( I do remember that it had a bunch of slides connected by rules. There was music and a menu screen too.

Anyway, it seems that you can make anything you want in whatever program, as long as they have the basics. The limitation is on you to make it real. And to think people at my office were amazed at my simple battleship game using conditional formatting.  I, Gamon, will save us Nice opinion  [removed] I'm an insurance policy. If things are going well, I don't have to do much. Plus I'm always the person who does things around the office. No one ever thinks of me as someone who doesn't pull their weight ..and in another game. You can get it on the New 3DS through the eShop. It's awesome to play on the go. I'm sure there are several GBA and SNES emulators out there, some even on Android! (or iOS if you've jailbroken.) > Word? Man I wish I could play this game again

No, Excel. Download znes and an earthbound ROM Totally worth it. Was silly, weird  crazy, super far out. Think it definitely holds up, as far as all the good words I've heard over the years. Definitely a bit tedious at times, being homesick or tired from the sun. Some of the other ills you can get were a bit irritating as well. But really, I'm barely complaining. Now I'd really like to play Mother and Mother 3.

Edit: words Yes, very much so. You may need a guide sometimes as it can be a little iffy on where to go, IGN has a great one. But the battle system and general gameplay are great, especially for older RPG noobs. It's not really grind heavy at all to just go through the game, and is funny and charming throughout, and pushes the boundary of the SNES in a lot of ways with the graphics and animation. It is absolutely a gem and one of the most unique games I've played, especially for a JRPG, a genre that is as filled with tropes as any.  Why is that picture on that meme? That thumb looks like a poo. I'm more impressed he still has the excel files. Great comment, next time make the points clearer by using bullet points. Reading "one" then "two" is really bothersome. Greatttt yea... I'm gonna need you to go ahead and file those TPS reports next time. I'm watching this. You get names like "Shoot the Bullet" to "Phantasmagoria of Flower View" and Subterranean animism.(Sounds like a Dissertation)

Sub-Subcultures blow my mind. Not that I can talk as some people like crappy fantasy novels and other like... things that apparently require a lot of mental effort cause damn. (Also Magically girls) Must've taken the MAJORAty of their workday.  Agreed, I can COUNT a few.  but death mountain would be west then... But now his shield is completely useless and doesn't block anything. He somehow broke his arm to get his shield behind his head in that position. I know for sure that in Twilight Princess they literally just mirrored the entire game world on the Wii compared to the GCN version. Yes, and in the mirrored pic it's in his right hand Depends which version of Zelda you are talking about. In Twilight Princess (Wii) and Skyward Sword it was in his right hand. I realize that this picture is probably of OOT but it doesn't have to be. Now he's off the road. Good point. Admittedly, Ocarina of Time is my focal point. That's rough buddy Are they worth money? I used to own Master's Quest, and Skies of Arcadia Legends, but I think they both ended up at Gamestop :( I'm in a similar position. I worked in fast food for a year and a half until I got into a desk position and everything feels much much slower. Maybe I too should learn how to do excel pixel art. 10x10 isn't square?? How can I make perfect squares, then? Legitimately curious how 10x10 isn't square. No snark here. Is it an excel issue or is my fundamental understanding of geometry wrong? If you switch to Print Layout view first, they'll be in inches and will be equal.

*Cue #mindblown* Huh? 10x10 is square.  When I start a new Excel sheet I press control a and then hold the control button while I resize one of the columns and all of them will do the same. I repeat the step with the rose That's absurd oh my gosh This guy's work is different, I think?

He seems to be more vector than bitmap...? You ever realize that you have zero talents? Even the things I've worked hard at, I'm only ever going to be good at.

 I bought Earthbound on the Wii U for $10. That was actually the best $10 I have ever spent. [deleted] Yeah I played the first 3rd of it on SNESoid for Android, worked great.  Or if you're looking for a legal option, Nintendo is selling Earthbound on its Wii U and 3DS virtual console. Granted, it's pretty overpriced at $10. "today was a good day" is a song by Ice Cube. That's a screenshot from the music video :) Cuz today was a good day I actually have somewhat of a problem with keeping a bunch of files for no reason. [Might also be the reason why I've never thrown out a hard-drive for like 13 years](http://puu.sh/sEQ2V.png). I don't know about that...

* Formatting a post takes time
* No option for numbered lists
* They should be called Wizard Points

edit:  Hey!  You were right! Well to be fair~~y~~, we should all be working right now, but instead we're **navi**gating on *zant*ernet.

I'm not good at this. I think it was painted =today()  there's only one thing we can do. we have to kill OP. Broken arms heh are you serious? If I was used to twilight princess that would infuriate me Well at least I still have my copy of Twin Snakes. I was told they were worth like $100 but looking at ebay right now I'm calling bullshit.

edit: on myself I hope you Excel! (Sorry) can I suggest something? I work in a desk position, it's not slow, but I really like slacking off, so I emailed myself the text of lord of the rings and pretended to read emails for a week and read lord of the rings and it's great and TBH it really gave me job satisfaction and I even tell people about it on the dancefloor when I'm high on drugs and stuff and people are impressed and rightfully so? Haha, I'm in a similar position too, except that I have work to do and just choose not to do it. Haha. don't ask me When resizing a  column in excel, the size of the column is given in the following format: "Width: xx (yy pixels)." 

When resizing a row in excel, the size of the row is given in the following format: "Height: zz (yy pixels)."

Because excel makes it's own height and width units, x/y is not equal to z/y. So if you want to make a perfect square, you need to go by the second number (pixels) and not the first number (some arbitrary unit).

For example, if you want to make a perfect square you will get something that reads like this: "Width: 0.63 (10 px)" and "Height: 6.00 (10 px).
 TLDR: Excel makes up different units for height and width

https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5gio0t/it_gets_slow_at_work_sometimes_so_i_started/dasvn9p/?st=iwbll6el&sh=2ecd8c60 Each cell isn't a square by default so 10 x 10 of them also isn't a square. The default cells are rectangular but you can change their default size to a square which is useful for certain things but not necessary for a typical database or data TLDR: Excel makes up different units for height and width

https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5gio0t/it_gets_slow_at_work_sometimes_so_i_started/dasvn9p/?st=iwbll6el&sh=2ecd8c60 I imagine they mean things with those dimensions in Excel, as in the width and height are using different units. Dank Reply *Luigi taping it* Not really relevant, but cool. I wouldn't call it "codebending"  either. I feel that part made it slightly less cool, and kind of lame therefore douchey. It's better to just let cool shit be cool, and not add not provide any input over it. But nifty, nontheless.  Thank you I really don't understand > Mysterious Harddrive

Aaaaaand, we've found the porn collection. You should buy a couple of big drives, configure them as RAID, and then just copy all that crap there. Beats having a lot of drives of varying sizes and ages without any redundancy. I have a thing for not having red almost full hard drives. When ever it's ready I try to clear away downloads, unwanted programs and anything else I can get ride of just to stop it from going red. Is that weird? :/ 1. Use RES to make formatting a breeze
2. Numbered lists are indeed a thing
3. 
4. Profit?? Don't triforce puns, let them come naturally! =SUM(something something something) But first, we need to get these stones scattered all across the country so we can time travel.  Yeah, it's pretty weird seeing it for the first time. Literally the entire game world is backwards, but you get used to it fairly quickly. I just borrowed the actual book from the library and read it. As long as i'm by the phone/radio and get all my paperwork done I have plenty of free time (If there's no customer service to be had.) You should create a mailing list! I'd subscribe to that This is amazing, thank you. I work in an office and have had days/weeks with literally nothing to do and it kills me. But at the same time, I feel like if I'm not typing it doesn't really look like I'm working. BUT, at the same time, I pay literally no attention to what anyone else is doing and my boss sits with his back to me so yeah this is a great suggestion overall You may not have that job for much longer Redditor for 2 years. How long have you waited for this moment?  nice i have a feeling you know, but you don't want to tell. because you hate what you cannot be, but that's OK Wow I never noticed that, i use excel everyday and always used the pixel count. Why would they make the units different? Makes no sense to me. Obviously. But in OP's image, there are square. Unless the guy was simply complaining about excel, in which case more power to him lol Gay remark! Green Mario** This

It's probably more healthy for the drives. I reluctently do it when my computer becomes slow as a snail or I really need more space. Recently I had to uninstall most of my Steam library just to make place for other games. T'was a sad day :( But sometimes it's hard for puns to link up.

__________________________
Good afternoon,
Please find attached as discussed, the order pertaining to the following text.

Dimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that many of the Orcs were demanding a halt. Uglúk was shouting. He felt himself flung to the ground, and he lay as he fell, till black dreams took him. But he did not long escape from pain; soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him again. For a long time he was tossed and shaken, and then slowly the darkness gave way, and he came back to the waking world and found that it was morning. Orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass.


Warm golden regards,

nutseed

PS please excuse my brevity but I'm at work and very tired and I miss my drugs About 2 years don't ask me. My guess? One width unit is the width of one character. And one height unit is one "point" (as in 12 point font). That's true, but that's not really what they were talking about here. Don't worry, I *past* it along. Haha, I **ganon**ot argue with that! That, Zora complete bust. You're who we all aspire to be <3 You're a fantastic person!

I hope you get your drugs soon ;) that seems about right This is exactly it, but it comes from fonts where all of the characters are the same width. Not all of them have this quality.  I do a lot of coding in VBA and I've learned very tediously that excel's size units for cells is the characters. So a cell of width 15 will perfectly fit 15 characters of a normalized font. That's actually a pretty good guess. I'm gonna check it out tomorrow when I get into work.  I was hoping the (light) argument you guys were having would help me figure out what he meant by 10x10 not being a square... but I'm still confused. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time  yes [I've highlighted a regular 10x10 in Excel.](http://imgur.com/a/ePz0C) Basically in Excel the height and width values don't use the same scale. So 10 x 10 would not give you a square if you just simply set the values for each dimension to that. Width is calculated based on how many 0's can fit in a cell across, and height is a calculation based on a "points" unit. There is more to it, but that's the important part.

Edit: http://dailydoseofexcel.com/archives/2004/06/01/column-widths-in-points/ this link I just found explains it a bit since I don't feel like typing anymore tonight. I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of GTX 1080s suddenly cried out... I must not hype.

Hype is the mind-killer.

Hype is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

I will face my hype.

I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the hype has gone there will be nothing.

Only I will remain. Something that doesn't really come across in the videos where they quantum jump like that is that moving like that is not a loading screen. You are actually moving through the space in a persistent instance. You could also cruise from the first to the second planet, and it might take hours, but its not just magically warping you there.  Im actually happy this game has a long time before a final or even beta release. It gives me time to upgrade my pc to actually handle it. THIS IS NOT A FEATURE.

This occurred in a display of the development engine features and is done in a developer's "god mode" that ignores atmospheric effects. No Man's sky it ain't  My current rig is about 6 years old now and i've been waiting for the right opportunity to buy a new build.  Cannot wait to play this game on a freshly built PC.  So yummy.   Hey folks, there some confusion about what's actually going on and I'd like to shed a little light: 

This was in the Cry-engine dev-kit itself. they aren't actually planning on letting you jump from inside one planets atmosphere to inside another.. especially at .2c or 2% the speed of light, which is how fast the ship was traveling. They are implementing physics based flight models in space, in atmosphere, and within planets atmospheres. Also the planets are going to be 1:5 the scale of actual planets, which is massive, and the systems are going to be designed with the same scale in mind.. meaning even if that planet he jumped to was 1.25 light seconds away, which is the distance from earth to the moon, it would take him over 60 seconds to get there. This demo was just to showcase different biomes in their new procedural planet generation model, meaning showcasing the different ways planets can look. 

Of course all of this is still in flux, and the developer, Chris Roberts, has said at a certain point fun and playability will take precedence over realism, or at least the level of realism they hope to achieve. They do not want the game to be hyper-realistic, but they the game is being delayed because of this new tech which allows to them to increase the level of realism while also making it more fun. 

Finally, if you look at /r/starcitizen right now, you are going to see a lot of heat on the front page, this has happened for two reasons: 

1. a lot of new people are showing up 

2. a lot of old people are getting antsy


**edit:**~~I'm pretty sure~~ there's a free fly week going on, **only for backers,** which allows you to use every current flight ready ship, and while the game, to me, is fun for a few minutes, it's nothing like it's going to be. The live-game gets cut from the dev-branch so  slowly because of how many things change so quickly, that the game we saw in that demo is likely 4 months away from being in our hands, and by that time Sq42 will be being finished. At least that's the hope. But with the 2.6 alpha build coming in less than a month they'll be implementing the much awaited fps game-mode and alot of back end changes and improvments to allow for 3.0 alpha build which is what you were seeing in the demo above. That demo, by the way, is 30 minutes long, you should all check it out. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdCFTF8j7yI

And here's a look at the previous demo, which a lot of people are saying was even better than this one

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l-epO6oUHE
 But do the planets have toilets that don't use water?
Because when I went to burning man it was just a dusty waterless shitstorm. Looks like they put all that money to good use. This may be worth the price just as a space sim alone.  Will SC have multiplayer? What I love about every current gaming discussion:

"NMS was such a disappointment, they should have taken their time to add the features they promised instead of rushing it out!"

"SC is going to be such a disaster, they constantly delay things to polish them and have nothing to show for it!" As a working professional who won't have 'Eve Online' amounts of time to play this, can I play this without other people? I don't want to be interdicted/griefed by YoloSwagFreshXXX #[**HERE IS THE LIVE GAMEPLAY OF THIS SCENE** \(featuring Mark Hamil\)](https://youtu.be/XuDj5v81Nd0?t=2h6m4s)  [deleted] For those who are interested, here is the 30 minute gameplay demo they did this past weekend showing off the newer version of the procedural generation tech they showed at Gamescom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdCFTF8j7yI

Note that it's all done live in game (including the camera fly-in at the beginning) - none of it is faked (though the actual encounter is all scripted). At 19:45 he scopes in on a space station in orbit and you can see the rings rotating - that's the same station that the camera flies past at the very beginning.

The game obviously has a long way to go yet, but it's getting the point where you can see real glimpses of what it could be in the future. The mechanic reminds me of Freelancer, that's a nice touch. I always wanted to play a game like this. I thank all of you who have donated to make it happen. I cant wait to buy it when it is released. Rip me no PC No Man's Elite Dangerous Eve Online.  When this does eventually come out, I might just have to take a vacation to my computer room. Saw the Gamescom video of this game and it's shaping up to be fantastic  I just realized that this is actually in r/gaming and not r/starcitizen Best part about this game is that if you WANTED to just fly there without quantum you could. Whenever I go into the comment's section for gameplay clips for SC I just see a lot of people talking about No Man's Sky that seem very upset that this game is doing well. 1. This game is a PC exclusive.


2. This game is nothing like NMS. If you enjoyed this, head on over to r/starcitizen for more! *generic comment comparing Star Citizen to No Man's Sky* I haven't seen you be able to get out of your ship and walk around - Is this possible in this game? Is star citizen worth getting if you liked games like ED  It's like NMS and ED had a baby, a beautiful beautiful baby. That will go on and do wonderful things in the world.  Damn. No chance of this hitting PS4 is it? :/  Here's a clip from the Gamescom 2016 demo from August. Gives a more accurate idea of travel and atmospheric entry:
https://youtu.be/3l-epO6oUHE?t=339

The only downside here is that the planets themselves are on the older V1 technology (V2 was shown this last Sunday at CitizenCon). I am refusing to get too excited but this already looks better than the game that shall not be named.  Looks like No Man's Sky, only not shit. I really hope Star Citizen is a good spiritual successor to Freelancer. Freelancer was so fun in that there were several ways to make a living, and lots of factions to ally or be hostile with. You couldn't be friends with everyone either, because allying with one meant you were often enemy to another. This made it so fun when passing through hostile space. The only thing freelancer lacked, and this was probably partially due to technology, is online multiplayer. It was lonely out there and fending for yourself gets old sometimes. If you could explore with a friend or a fleet, you could achieve much bigger goals.  A part of me is happy about the fiasco of NMS unmet expectations so long term projects like this will be more proactive to deliver a better project to avoid similar criticisms. Wait, so Star Citizen is what we wanted out of NMS? Funny how No Man's Sky reputation is causing people to look at this game like grumpy old men look at the government.  This one gif by itself gives me more hope than I ever had for No Man's Sky. That being said I'm not preordering/ buying this game until it's in something of a complete state. I learned that lesson long before No Man's Sky It's like No Man's Sky without the bullshit! This is truly sensational I've had my doubts about this project, but this is actually pretty amazing. Is this the game Hello Games ripped off? This looks far superior than the way no mans sky tried to do it  For folks that missed it here is the full live demo this was pulled from.  Has space flight, ground vehicles, and FPS stuff.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdCFTF8j7yI&feature=youtu.be Somewhere in the basement of an expensive house in the UK, Sean Murray is sipping his beer and thinking "So THAT'S how it's done". Rip No Mans Sky It's like no mans sky but it works! Damn it!  This looks great...but can I just have a re-make of X-Wing...or X-Wing Alliance?  With a riveting single player story?  A *real* flight-sim too, not the arcade-y Battlefield-esque junk included with Battlefront.

I can just imagine a scene like this in that type of game.  Rogue Squadron takes off from Yavin IV, and does an emergency hyperspace jump in the atmosphere to an imperial attack going on nearby.  The kicker is you have objectives in space, and possibly in the atmosphere as well.  Do some close air support, and then take it into space to fend off a star destroyer. As cool as this is I really hope this is a planet and a moon otherwise the astrophysics wouldn't make sense for planets to be this close. Star Citizen worth a buy now?  Im feeling pretty confident in this game! What game is this? It looks dope Now that's how you fucking travel! That is SO COOL!!!!!!!!! Where can we download this game? I am considering buying the game, can anyone tell me if it is worth it quick? Just like the bullet points. I am considering it more than normal today since I just bought my 1080 (upgrading from a 960)

Edit: thank you all for the response :-) Epic can't wait What game is this, what is it about? Looks sick I feel like this is a massive "fuck you" to no man's sky Kinda frustrating seeing people say don't believe the hype due to no mans sky. NMS was a game built for the PS4. SC is a PC game, todays hardware is capable of this never mind 2 years from now. Hello games had like 16 guys who only previously worked on 2d games. CIG has 200 plus and a lot of them are veterans with no outside pressure from someone like Sony. Dont think NMS had a massive budget either, SC is up to 125$ million and still going. I cant remember much about NMS pre release material, but i do remember quite a few vague answers or straight up lies without much gameplay at all. For SC they are 100% open about everything, bugs, development processes, hours of real time gameplay demo's, future plans what is possible, what could be possible, and there is a playable build right a long with it that they (slowly) add to. The only problem i have is that they are a tad overzealous with release dates. Personally id be happy with just Squadron 42. This "game" is barely a proof of concept (in terms of gameplay) and already it's superior to NMS.

Amazing. My mind is blown. Is this in game at the moment ? I have this game but i cant find my ship I own in the hanger :/  So...what am I supposed to do with this raging hard on NOW? 

Thanks a lot OP! This is just disgustingly good. Guys, NMS was riding the wave that Star Citizen started. Please stop comparing the two. The only reason that game existed was because Star Citizen proved that there was money to be made in space sims. 

Just because you're only hearing of Star Citizen now, doesn't mean it'll be the next No Mans Sky. The only reason half of you are making the NMS comparison is because NMS is probably one of, like, 2 or 3 space sims that you've ever heard of or played, and it was hardly a space sim at that. 

Those of us that were following Star Citizens development could have told you it would be amazing close to 4 years ago, before NMS was even announced. Moreover, anyone with half a brain could have realized that NMS would flop the moment they read "procedural generation". And to think people are *still* calling Star Citizen a scam.. hah. Also just for the record, this .gif was taken from the editor, it's highly unlikely you're going to be able to jump from planet to planet in the actual game. (as in, it won't be as unrealistic as this, which is absolutely a good thing) ...in error. [deleted] I have the alpha and it is actually very well optimized. The main issue is the net code, which is one of the final things that will be fixed.  I've only got a 970 and that runs it swimmingly even in Alpha right now. He who controls the hype controls the universe.

Bless the Maker and His water.
Bless the coming and going of Him.
May His passage cleanse the world. Nice reference man Youre Hype im not  

You apply excessive Hype, i control that hype through fluid motion,  
  

That means relaxing the Hype so it can react instantly without resistance-no, without thought.     
  

Do you see now? It means becoming like clear water. Between this and the sand worm it seems like there's cool stuff but is any of it actually implemented?  
  
I own the game but seem to have trouble just figuring out where to go or what to do and sort of wish that it felt a bit more accessible. Do we know what other people see when you do it? If someone was a very clever asshole, could they fly into your quantum jump path and let you crash into them?

EDIT: apparently you can and also you can't. Thanks guys They've figured out how to queue up the resources needed for your destination starting when you decide to jump. There is a brief pause before the jump to facilitate this. 

You're able to interrupt the jump at any time because what's in between the two places? Nothing. Maybe debris or a ship, which should have also been queued up. 

It's amazing technology. Another thing they're working on is faces. The face tech is unbelievable.  Let's just say it explicitly- it's not like the con-job in NMS. Haha I have been trying to get a friend to go to PC....I think the sandworm gif worked on him!  Plenty of time to get a good working rig. I like how they're being totally open about the development process and getting people involved in playing the beta. It makes it so much easier to see where they're going with it. It's one of the most open development processes I've ever seen for any studio ... anywhere frankly. But one of the selling points of the original announcement was that it will have next level graphics such that most GPU won't be able to run it at good fps. At this point it seems like it will launch when new GPU will be able to play it like normal.  That's good to hear.  I was thinking this appeared too fast. *That said* this still demonstrates a pretty phenomenal technological achievement - while travel like this probably will be restricted for gameplay reasons, *the engine created for the game makes this sort of demonstration possible.* Good.

I've done the first half of this in Evochron before. I exploded before I left the atmosphere. So you mean I can't pull a Force Awakens and warp from inside a cargo hold into the atmosphere of another planet? You may not be able to jump from within a planet's atmosphere to another planet's atmosphere, but the atmospheric effects and lighting once you're on those planets are real features. Good to see someone posted it. Oh, thanks. Great to know. I was wondering if there will be atmospheric conditions and you could "burn" if done that and was wondering if this was ignored because he jumped into the ship in dev mod. You guys should learn to be cautiously optimistic by now. http://i.imgur.com/XUoQAbD.gifv YES MAN'S SKY It's like they saw the trailer for no mans sky and thought, yeah, we can actually do that. You might want to make that call when it's actually out...how many times does this need to happen before you dumb asses learn what your mistake is? At this point nothing could possibly go wrong. Star Citizen could take shits that look and play better than NMS 1080s will be pretty cheap by the time it comes out too! What's the expected plan for full release?  

I have 980ti that chugs along the alpha ok..  But holding off on a new build until this is released.

It's a monster and I can't wait for the new wave of games! :D .2C is 20% of the speed of light. Just FYI. xD Please do not say 2.6 will be out in a month.  It is misinformation.  It might be out.  It might not. > I'm pretty sure there's a free fly week going on

Citation needed. Looks all ships unlocked for backers only, not users with no pledge. Did I mention I went to burning man? No essays, please. They evidently just had a "CitizenCon" convention, where a lot of people were salty because they set their expectations too high, and Star Citizen didn't deliver certain this or that.

...just to put things into perspective. MMO persistent universe portion, yes.

Squadron 42 is the single player military campaign that takes place in the same universe. That was a glimpse of the multiplayer universe, so yes anything you hear or see about Star Citizen that doesn't have SQ42(single player campaign) in it, is most likely referring to the multiplayer universe :) It will be a MMO so yeah  Yes, but your chances of meeting another player is incredibly low because of the size of the universe. ^^^/s it already does [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l-epO6oUHE) some footage of the upcoming 3.0 alpha release of Star Citizen, which is the MMO side of it. Its currently on alpha 2.5, 2.6 should be up in the next few months. 3.0 possibly before christmas, but I'd say it'll be sometime in the new year. Yeah, SC is the antithesis of NMS in that regard. CIG decided not to show the SQ42 presentation because it wasn't polished enough.

Sony decided to release NMS despite it being severely cut down.

I prefer the former over the latter any day. Exactly.  So, what your saying is gamers are twat waffles? This is my concern as well. But, I am a backer of the game, and I've spent a good amount of time in it already.

Here's what I've been able to gather from the forum posts of Devs, as well as interviews/demo presentations:

* Chris Roberts (creator) intends some ships to *require* multiplayer interaction. For example, the RSI polaris that was just released is roughly a 24-man crewed ship. It's something they intend for large groups of organized people to put together

* They are talking about and planning to implement NPC teams. To what degree, I don't know - but they have mentioned multiple times that they want you to be able to hire NPC teams to crew your ships. This is massive for players like me who have a small org, may play at different times than most, but still want to crew my 5-6 person vessel.

* They've also mentioned that even though some ships are 4-8 players in crew capacity, it will be possible to have full control and be able to sufficiently pilot the ship with only 1-2 players. Having extra makes the job easier (i.e. delegation of tasks), but it will be possible solo. Which ships and whether or not this makes it to release, no idea.

* Everything is persistent (nothing new here), so that the work you put in will save on exiting. You'll be able to work towards earning everything in the game, no paywalls or restrictions (this is the plan, nothing is set in stone until release).

I think the big thing is what you want to do with your time. If you can't put shit tons of time into the game, then maybe stay away from the playstyles/professions that will require asinine amounts of time to become a powerhouse in. 

I do think, though, that every facet of this game will be accessible to all levels of play to some degree. 

The only thing I'd recommend is that if you're not willing to back the game now (waiting to release is 100% justified), then just keep a lookout for the "Free-Fly" events. They literally give you free access to the game, and allow you to try out some specific ships at their choosing. The events can last a weekend, or a whole week - just depends. But it's a great way to "demo" the game without having to pay any money. (Some free-fly events are for the general public, others are for subscribers/backers only. Just FYI) yeah it has single player There won't be grind like a typical MMO, you have your ship, personal gear and weapons and perhaps reputations and licenses to obtain. No things like skill points, class systems, levels and what else. There's no tangible endgame either. So you're not deprived of the full star citizen experience simply because you have a starter ship. 

You don't need to own a badass ship to actually venture out with the nerds to do large scale battles. Simply sign up as a crew member! The best I can say is that it's the most ambitious space sim ever planned.

This is the most recent quick rundown I could find

 Google it, crowdfunded game, 4years in development so far, no release date, expected in mid to late 2018 or 2019 Well, Chris Roberts made Freelancer, so that's no surprise. It's made by the same man
 I loved multiplayer Freelancer so much, I'm glad people out there still remember it. I'm hoping the combat in SC is similar. There's also a ship called Freelancer in the game. You know its the same lead developer right? RIP me have PC but it sucks  Not that they are cheap, but cheaper than they ever have been. Start saving now, and you might have enough for a good rig by the time this gets a commercial release - especially if you keep an eye out for sales and deals on individual parts. I'm sure if you saved $50 a week, you could have a pretty decent rig by the time the game comes out in about 5 or 6 years. No Man's Eve: Dangerous Seriously this is the kind if game Ive been waiting for No release date. The game suffered from the success of its crowdfunding campaign, and has been forced to changed drastically the scope of its development, but in the good direction (bigger, better, shinier). Since there is no publisher, the devs are taking their time to produce every element of the game and make sure everything is in a perfect condition, even if this means delaying its release even more.

A lot of people regard the constant delays as proof that CIG does not know what they are doing and the whole project will crash. Other welcome this approach which slaps in the face of the "release quick fix later" that seems to prevail of late in the gaming industry.

A lot of people as well have no idea how is a video game developped, and seem to think that the development takes place between the announcement and the release, that is usually around 2 years. This is utterly false. A game, especially triple A (the largest games) can take 4 to 10 years to be completed from initial design to release. Star Citizen has been public since initial design, 4 years ago.

Read about it, don't trust the haters, don't trust the fanboys, make up your mind, but don't expect a release anytime soon.

 Have you seen the CitizenCon video? It is even more amazing. I see people who are probably just figuring out that they should wait for the game to be released before paying for it. In other words, people are learning, at least, some of them are. *generic response contrasting Star Citizen and No Man's Sky* Yes you can land anywhere or stop in space and jump out of your ship, you can even walk around your ship well it's flying.. That is if you have a copilot flying it.  Very much so. Nope. Thank god.  Yes. If all goes to plan. Nah, it's a lot more than that, just to give you an idea, you can board an enemy capital ship, disable their gravity generator, put on magnetic boots, and hunt the captain and his crew down to take over the ship and warp out before the police get to you. Hopefully more than what we wanted out of No Man's Sky. Although it's not going to be an infinite playspace with randomly generated planets, each planet will be curated and there will be somewhere around 400 planets or so (give or take 300). I'm still at a loss as to what the expectation was for NMS.  I never saw the appeal of the promise and it still failed to deliver on several parts of that.  Star Citizen's opening goal has always been a strong Wing Commander-like story driven single player and a multiplayer-centric MMO akin to Freelancer.  I can't imagine someone would have expected either of those from NMS from what I saw before launch. So, cautious and critical of what they're seeing to avoid hype?
 Just an FYI they let you play for free in its current alpha state on free weekends all the time. If someone makes the next X-Wing game, I will squeal. Star Citizen will likely one day have a star wars mod server, at least. Well you're in luck. Star Citizen comes with a single campaign that will remind you of the Wing Commander series. Trailer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FF-ewiwmhs It's a demo setup, that's all. I would say no. Wait until 3.0 which should come sometime around the end of the year. But there is probably about 10 hours worth of stuff to do in SC right now.

The biggest thing right now is the netcode, even the beefiest computers are lagging in the universe, but that should be fixed in the next patch (2.6). No. Unless you plan on helping with the development. Bug test. Stress test. Report issues you find. robertsspaceindustries.com

Also check out /r/starcitizen for FAQs and Q&A threads. I would recommend holding off until single player is released.  If you buy it today it is still very limited in the scope of what you can do, and you might just burn yourself out before more fun versions are released later on.  I say this as an early backer as well, there is no need to drop money on this, unless you think it is a worthy project to fund, and don't expect much bang for your buck right now. If you already like space games, definitely.  If it is just mild curiosity, hold off until the next free fly week and decide then.  If you don't like it then, just keep chilling until another free fly after a big update.  Eventually you will either have bought it or the game will be effectively complete and you won't care.  =D

The only reason to buy now is to support the development or get a better deal.  There is no reason to buy it just to find out if you like it or not; make use of the occasional free trials. Star Citizen. There is also a single player game called Squadron 42. It's a space combat sim with a crap load of features. FPS, Dogfights, Mining, Trade, Exploration. It's still a long way out, but the development is the most open I've ever seen. You need to place your ship in the hangar, find a little dot on the floor, highlight and click, and you can place objects (inc ships).

You don't need to enter the hangar to play though, just select universe and you should be able to spawn your ship from the console in port Olisar. It isn't.  The space to planet landing stuff won't arrive until 3.0 which is scheduled before the end of the year, last I heard. Quantump jumps are in the game. You can use it in the persistent universe to jump across long distances. and their fans were suddenly silenced. A bit more info here - http://www.gamersnexus.net/news/2637-system-specs-for-demo-pcs-at-citizencon-2016 Tell that to my GTX 960. Even at 720p, the fans spin up to the point where it sounds like the screams of the damned, and even then I can only get about 20 FPS. The hype must flow. Holy Christ shai hulud.  I bought Star Citizen years ago but lets just say the last space game with giant sand worms didn't work so well...

God I want this game to be good so badly.  the quantum travelling is implemented, but not the sand worm or any planet side stuff Yeah Right now if you aren't super involved it can def be hard to figure out what to do. Current version of the game you can jump and even cancel mid jump. People have also done time lapses of cruising between relatively close points that took 7+ hours instead  of quantum jumping. In a few months we will see a few ships with Electronics warfare kits capable of pulling Other ships out of Quantum travel mid jump. Like a pirate trying to ambush cargo Haulers. I dont think so. The actual game is at 2.6 i think.  You can't go down to the planet surface in the live version, but you can quantum travel between stations, moons, asteroid fields, etc. yeah in the twitch vod it happened towards the end...i'll see if i can find it
found it: https://youtu.be/mLk6NWCUf8M?t=7734 Well you are moving super fast, but yeah there have been videos where people have captured moments of other ships quantum traveling. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G29b0GKX6Sc)

Edit: A lot of people are having a hard time seeing it, which makes sense as it is very small. This was captured by accident so there wasn't like a great shot or anything. Full screen the video and go to 1:20. Look at the circle in the upper right corner and you will see a very small light traveling to it from the center of the screen. That is the ship. It actually does travel from the bottom left to the top right. At the end of the video when you see it, that is half speed, so it is def hard to see.

Edit 2: Thank you to /u/lord_dale for providing this-
>Here (http://i.imgur.com/JODH06G.jpg) is a visual aid to find the path of the ship provided by the video-author. Found it to be easier to track on the second run (0:24 - 0:33) Theoretically... but I think you'll be pulled out of quantum travel if that happens As v3rge mentioned I believe an automated system pulls you out of quantum to prevent this. I believe that is the lore explanation for how interdiction works. Some ships will have E-warfare tools to pull ships out of quantum mid flight. Like a pirate crew ambushing cargo haulers. I believe lore explanation is it has a way to flag ships as though there is an obstruction in their path. Link? just for a reason why other development teams don't do it.. it takes time and energy; plus like this last citizencon, it puts them at risk of over-hyping.

I would prefer they stop with some of the weekly podcasts and such, unless it's really short or something (haven't tuned in). They can say they enjoy interacting with the community but at the end of the day it's an added stress. I just thought it was weird that he jumped in atmosphere. I didn't like it. Haha Yeah 64 bit positioning allows for [ALOT](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s400/ALOT.png) more space in-game. How is that game? 

I just recently stumbled onto it, and looked at what it claims to offer - I'm kind of perplexed that it's not more popular. http://imgur.com/gallery/spZou2E Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice and can't get fooled again. Ah screw that! How do I preorder? I mean people have had access to every build of this so far so it's alright to be a little optimistic.... It may take forever but I'm pretty sure it will be awesome when it's finished.  Evolve (Flop on PC)

Battleborn (FLOP)

Borderlands the presequel (Well its Gearbox Australia and its not to be expected that a different studio can bring the feel of the original studio)

Man its been a bad as of late https://gfycat.com/RemarkableIllfatedFlies Do you think it's possible for Shaun to have saved face if he made a drunken YouTube video a week before release explaining everything wrong with the game? Bill Man's Nye Ah Hell Naw Man's Sky inb4 recreation of No Man's Sky trailer using Star Citizen It kinda was the other way around NMS saw the Star Citizen trailer and thought to themselves "we can do something like that in 2 years!" and then failed.

Star Citizen revived space games and I love it. There are so many coming out :D Possib-lie Yeah, cause they'll be on the 1980 series by then.

^I ^kid >1080s will be pretty cheap

Hah If your talking about the single player, sometime in 2017, the online game, who knows.  Chris Roberts won't be releasing the single player or the online game until it is up to his standards.  He's able to do this because the game is player backed at $126,000,000 to date.  If you're interested in the game, I would wait until 3.0 to drop.  That would better reflect what you just saw.

edit:  $127,682,452 Im pretty sure early of 2019 is the most plausible release date SC Glad I wasn't the only one pedantic enough to comment on this. > They evidently just had a "CitizenCon" convention, where a lot of people were salty because they set their expectations too high, and Star Citizen didn't deliver certain this or that.
>

> ...just to put things into perspective.

It's not so much that what they did show failed to live up to expectations, but rather what they didn't show. People were expecting to see a mission from Squadron 42 demoed, but they weren't able to finish it in time (issues with animations apparently). It's not that they didn't deliver, it's just that we didn't get a single preview of sq42 what so ever. We were expecting to get more than a slideshow.

But honestly a year from now it will probably be seen as a good decision.

I welcome the fact that they're maintaining quality of quantity. MAN THAT SOUNDS SOOOOO FAMILIARRRRR Where was the salt?

Is that what cheering and applause is, now a days? People weren't salty because they "didn't deliver certain this or that" they just didn't show Squadron 42 because some animations were unpolished.

Fix your wording and don't spread misinformation. Hello Games made the decision not Sony. Blaming Sony is pushing the blame to the wrong person. thank you for the thorough well written response! I basically have to wait, since my primary computer is an old macbook, this will be the game to push me to build/by a pc.

Very encouraging to hear about NPC crews. I can't imagine how much fun a first person FTL would be Well the single player portion is like an entirely different game isn't it? As in a seperate purchase  I should be noted that he said that they were aiming for one patch per quarter. He did not give specific dates. Wow. I had no idea they were doing so much! Farming? Salvage? That sounds incredible! 

I'm so glad i backed it early and then ignored the hype. I'll have to seriously consider playing next year. C'mon tax return!  It'll be worth every second I waited for it too. ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^so ^^^^^^fucking ^^^^^^hope I've been jonesing for a true Freelancer successor since I played the first one. It had so much potential. When I heard Chris was doing this game, I had to check it out. Been watching the progress from afar since. If it manages to live up to the hype, and I think it can, this will be the game to beat for a decade.  Didn't know that, good to know who's behind Star Citizen. I've played freelancer and the current "baby persistent universe" of star citizen. 
  
SC combat feels very similar, if a bit faster paced. It's definitely heading in the right direction for fans of Freelancer. Nope, haven't really looked into Star Citizen. But that's awesome. No worries. Start saving $20 bucks a month and you should have plenty to buy an amazing computer when SC is finally released. Plus if you wait to buy close to release day the CPU/GPU tech will have increased to get you better performance. No Man's Eve: Dangerous Citizen Yup. Both sides are almost equally toxic. 

However SC is more or less missing their own internal deadlines. Which are almost never hit by any company on earth. You set a deadline not to be realistic, but to set everyone in high gear and not to have everyone lackadaisically prancing around and twiddling their thumbs.  *subtly inflammatory comment criticizing rebuttal* Then i will. There is nothing wrong with being cautious and critical but some take it too far and are just cynical to the point of actively working against the game for some reason  The scaling isn't totally true to life, either. While its the best I've seen especially with the atmosphere and biomes, it still has that slightly cartoonish appearance where you can see a mountain range spiking out of the surface of the planet. On the ISS if you pass over Everest its a tiny little bump. Sir, our scout groups have checked that the crap game we destroyed was not No Man's Sky. Like i said, the FPS is low due to server issues. If you were playing by yourself offline, your performance would be much better.  my 960 pulls a cool 25-30 fps at 1080p SAND WORM?!

Will we get spice too? Can ordinary users do quantum jumps to any planet in the playable released version of the game? in freelancer they were known as lane hackers because the jumps could only be done in designated ageira technologies trade lanes. the lane hackers (ex atech employees) would assist rouges and outcasts to pull a cargo ship out of the lane.  Not accurate.

The quantum system projects a tiny field way forward, it's used both in regular space and in wormhole travel.  If the field encounters sufficient mass to be effective it causes the drive to shut down.   So the problem with interdiction is that you may have knocked the ship out of quantum travel, but it might also be 3,000km from you as well. Not even, we're still at 2.5, but 2.6 is set to come in a few weeks time Holy shit that's awesome! I'll let you know in 4 hours if I need to see a doctor "Did you see it?"    
No    
"Let's watch it again!"    
Still didn't see anything.    
"Okay, now at half speed"    
No, I don't see anything.    
(repeated this 3 times) That is a pretty bad ass thing to see in the game. You have to go full screen and hd to see it but that is really cool.
 Oh man I hope so. I'm gonna get a huge ship and drive it into people's jump paths to pull them out like an Imperial Interdictor cruiser. I dont think so.

You can Quantum Travel without setting a target I think.

A few weeks ago, I started to Quantum Travel and just exploded. I think I Quantumed into an asteroid :( (Salivates)

Hot damn look down the comment chain, here I was trying to trick the game into letting me be an Interdictor ship and it turns out the game will just let me do it. https://gfycat.com/QuestionableOfficialCero https://gfycat.com/QuestionableOfficialCero From the Star Citizen planets v2 demo. Those weekly shows are paid for by subscribers and the subscription income isn't included in the development funds. Subscribers get neat perks but nothing that gives you an advantage in game For real. I much prefer how Elite Dangerous handled this.

I mean, you can play the game right now. It just doesn't have the ability to land on planets yet. Something had to make up for The Witcher 3 I bought Mario Maker, and I was pretty happy with my purchase. Battleborn was so fun too, just mistimed release with Overwatch. You're missing Division Wait, what was wrong with Mafia 3? We gor dishonored 2 and shadow warrior 2 to look forward to, they should be fun at least in the gameplay department Gears of War 4 (Ge4rs or Gears of 4 as I like to call it) is pretty great

I hear the campaign is mediocre but not bad. but the multiplayer is top notch The Science Sky Next update they'll introduce giant dinosaur-like aliens and flying whales. That's the first thing that's ever gone wrong. All jokes are based on a bit of truth... ^^^cries You're joking, but.... You might not be wrong. Most video cards that are 3 years old are quite affordable  I already bought into the game.  I'm not too bothered how long he takes!  I'm just not going to upgrade my rig until it's full release.   > People were expecting

Could it be said that if people weren't expecting that, that they wouldn't have been disappointed?  The way I understand it, nobody promised Squadron 42.  It was merely hinted at.  When something I'm excited about gets hinted at, I usually go overboard. I think it already was a good decision if you go back and rewatch the Morrow Tour from last year. I think that was shown a little earlier than they would have liked, which is why it was quickly overshadowed by all the planetary tech. This S42 demo is supposed to be the showcase that sets the very bar of what people should expect from all the other chapters once they're complete, so I'm all for them taking their time to make sure nothing is lacking when they do show it.  The issue with CitizenCon is people were expecting to see a mission of Squadron 42 (the single player campaign) demoed at the event, but they weren't able to finish it in time. What was demoed did live up to expectations though. Except this time, we still have a beautiful game with acceptable play elements, and the game itself is still in development? 4300 upvotes on this https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/56pfe9/you_guys_are_going_to_hate_me_but_citizencon/ Maybe not salt but the subreddit was not left in hype train mode after Citizen Con. Expectations were set high by Chris at the end of Games Con and that got the rumour mill flying in the community so there was a lot of stuff hoped for that was never really planned. Having one thing that was planned, the Squadron 42 Demo, cancelled was also a bit of a bummer but this is why we were happy with Chris Roberts running the show. 

He wasn't happy with it so he pulled the plug on showing it, that is exactly why I gave him some of my money.  I would also like to point out that (per Chris Roberts), while some of the larger ships will have large crews, only a small fraction of those will HAVE to be actual players. For example, the Idris frigate is crewed by ~50 but only 5-7 will have to be actual players. The rest will be NPC crew.  
  
It seems to me that only the capital class of ships are meant to require multiple people to operate. So many of these ships you see now on the Star Citizen website that say, for example, "Max Crew: 6", should be perfectly flyable with just you and 5 NPC crew.  
  
Of course this is all subject to change as the game is still in alpha.  
  
Link for where I got the info - https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/56z5ew/random_things_i_learned_from_chris/d8nmgl6 Correct, but that doesn't mean you can't play SC alone. Get a good-size mini hauler like a Reliant or something and you easily Bounty Hunt or Cargo Haul on your own. Alpha 4.0 would give us a close enough approximation to a Beta that I'd say we won't see it until mid 2018. That's only 6 months later than planned, but at that point you have 95% of your game built and I think they're going to take their time polishing it. Yep! 


Repair is also pretty amazing so its not you normal repair in most games. You will still be able to do the almost instant repair on certain service locations. But with this is that you will be repairing ships your self ranging from small fighters to capital class ships.

[Here](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/txracgb7pr9d3r/cover/AnvilcrucibleIDRISFORMATION.jpg) you see three dedicated repair ships (the Crucible) repair a capital class frigate (the Idris) 

 Yeah, its Chris Roberts. He seems pretty cool. I never played his older games but following Star Citizen has made me view him positively.  By the time SC is released he would have enough saved for his grandkids college education. Darude - sandstorm This is one of the first times ever where Internal Deadlines are being seen by the community. As a game tester, this shit is just same old game development for me, except I happen to know more about SC's development than I do 3/4ths of the game's I've tested in the past. *mediocre pun that gets gilded* The planets will be 1/4 scale for gameplay reasons. This makes traveling down to the planets and getting around much easier. It also makes traversing the star systems less painful. 

The planet they showed in the demo is also smaller than what they were planning on using AFAIK. Makes the demo quicker. 

Lastly, the camera that is zooming down to the surface is extremely sped up, or else we'd probably still be here watching it fly around.  They mentioned that planets are about 1/8th of true size because if they were true to life, gravity wells would be insane, re-entry would take 10 minutes...

Sometimes gameplay trumps realism. They found the makings of a game, but they estimate that it has been in production for some time. Hello Games lied to us! Terminate them, immediately! Help us Serverside Jesus!  how else can you quantum travel? You get spoce.  
Which is 30% different and doesn't come with a C&D order. Not if House Harkonnen has anything to say about it.  You Atreides?  You smell like an Atreides. Do you spice? HE WHO CONTROLS THE SPICE, CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE!! I know. When I saw the sand worm it was like a Dune dream come true. Patience Muad'Dib Bless the Maker and all His Water. Bless the coming and going of Him, May His passing cleanse the world. May He keep the world for his people.  There should at least be a fat disgusting baron that you can kill. >rouges

*flashes back to Orgrimmar general chat 2005* You could just shoot the lanes in single player, did that not work in multiplayer? 3000 KM is not far. Interdiction will be a built in part of the game. I'm sure they won't develop it only for it to be completely useless. Won't be seeing planetary surface stuff like this until 3.0 which will be January if we're lucky. And Star Marine will release "sometime next month". 

At least that's what was said in August 2015 I'll have needles ready in 3 hours  You might also like non warp drive [video](https://youtu.be/hVf1GKqaoMI?t=12s) Yeah I explained this to someone else. Not my video and the video was made for the SC subreddit which has a better understanding of what to look for. Full screen the video and at 1:20 look at the circle toward the upper right corner. Right before the video ends you will see a tiny light moving toward it from the center of the screen. That is the ship and at that point of the video, its only moving at half speed. Very hard to see if you don't know what to look for or where to look for it. It's a tiny white dot moving diagonally from both left to top right. Looks a bit like when you see a satellite moving across the sky in real life the video should have said "look at the space station top right, eventually a pixel will fly there" This is very likely a big part of the game in the near future when cargo and transport missions are implemented. Actual interdiction is gonna be a thing sometime between 3.0 and 4.0 (can't remember which one specifically from the presentation slides).

I'd imagine (pure speculation here) it'd work something like Star Wars interdictors too, by projecting a massive gravity well, since maneuvering ships into flight paths would be rather hit or miss. More so miss considering the size of space. The word "Interdictor" is used on ships and player/npc roles so chances are that's going to be possible. The game space now is big, but not infinite. You can still run into the borders of the area. No, you just went out of the map (the map is very small for now) Per their [post-3.0 roadmap](http://imgur.com/a/BhUxp), quantum interdiction is targeted for 3.1.

In terms of dates, 3.0 is scheduled to release by the end of this year, and 3.1 something like 2-3 months after that.

Tack on another 2-3 months of delays and we're looking at May/June-ish. Yep, that will be a facet of the game as is :) That does look incredible...too incredible. They have the resources and expertise, so I'm rooting for them, but I'll believe this will be in the playable game when it's in the playable game. Thatsapenis.gif Okay. That's it. This game is in fact 100000% more amazing than I thought. Is that star citizen too? Gif ended too soon. I like how he shot it a couple times, then it turned to look at him and it looks like he hit panic mode in the last few frames... What the bejeebus! I had no idea this was a part of Star Citizen. I already purchased the game in 2014, is there  a website or a video where I can see the implemented features and future plans? I mean what does the game consist of right now?  This was just a demo. They placed a waypoint inside the atmosphere for times sake. no but you can high wake from orbital cruse. Is she still doing anything? Last I heard about her was releasing a book but that was years ago. It's not rocket appliances! I love that GWB and rickyisms are easily confused... that actually sounds like a great web quiz. Who said it-- President Bush or a Trailer Park Boy?

    My minds started racing against each other.	

    It's time for the human race to enter the solar system.

    It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it. 

    I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family.

    Well, I think if you say you're going to do something and don't do it, that's trustworthiness.

    Quite frankly, teachers are the only profession that teach our children.

    One word sums up probably the responsibility of any Governor, and that one word is, 'to be prepared'.

    I just want you to know that, when we talk about war, we're really talking about peace.

    A low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls.

    I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.






 This better not be another fuckin toadaso.  You know the one he's standing there like "OH THIS SUIT ISSS A GEORGIO ARMANI, YEAH MY DAAAD KNOWS HIM" J COLE WENT DOUBLE PLATINUM NO FEATURES The beat in that song is so good. #**COLE WORLD** No I believe Tennessee  Is it fun? Wtf how It's honestly depressing that CDPR release this amazing game with all these pro-consumer practices that looks like it might elevate the industry to a new standard, but instead every other dev was like "well, they win, we give up, here's some half-finished garbage." Some weird video game ritual where every promising game was sacrificed to bring us the glory that is the Witcher 3. Who needs /r/gamingcirclejerk with threads like these? [deleted] I can't seem to get into Witcher 2. It seems a bit...silly? I think it could be a translation thing cos some of the names feel a bit crappy. A Witch Hunter? Do you see what I'm saying? And one of the town names sounded silly. I dunno - is it worth me giving it another chance? I love Skyrim! Witcher just had a silly vibe to it. Almost like Lord Of the Rings + Wizard of Oz. I still want a wiiu just for that game. Im definitely gonna buy the gimped 3ds version just to have it still playing it! Agreed. It's no Borderlands, but it's certainly a fine game. Just unlucky. and no advertising and just banking on the fact that they made borderlands before We don't mention the division here....ever. From what I hear, the PC Port has been very middling.  Not a deal breaker for some people, others are waiting until it gets more stable.  As for the game itself, I hear it is pretty good but starts to feel repetitive. 

This is just what I heard from other posts and comments, I haven't played it myself so take this with a grain of salt.  If you don't have any salt, head over to /r/NoMansSkyTheGame, they have dumpsters of the stuff. Mostly performance and Bugs. the gameplay itself is quite fun and pretty good, but ye... ugh bugs.
 It has bugs and we can't stand bugs! Hey check out this hilarious physics glitch gif of GTA V!  Oh boy, here we go... Makes me wonder how many generations of video cards we've been through waiting for half life 3. Chris Roberts said during the September 26th GamersNexus interview that they were going to show a Squadron 42 mission. Watching the whole event it was very clear to me that it had been planned around the expectation that a big chunk of it was going to be the SQ42 video. They were caught short with that and had to fill most of the time with pretty dull filler material. The whole Spectrum talk was probably supposed to be a couple of minutes, if it was going to feature at all. The presenters were also pretty awkward, probably because they all knew people weren't going to see what they had expected and were filling time.

So I don't think this one is fair to pin just on the audience. I also don't think the bit in CryEditor was supposed to be there either, that was supposed to be in Frankfurt's ATV (Sean Tracy alluded to that while they were showing it). No they literally said they were going to show it at CitCon and then told people they werent actually the day of What is great is that Chris Roberts himself pulled the demo because he didn't think it was polished enough. Chris cares about quality and knows how to develop games. But people will still overhype it and set their expectations too high, and it won't deliver certain this or that. 

That's what sounds familiar.  You never played any of the wing commander games?  If your brain can handle old graphics, they are definitely worth playing  And enough left over to even afford a value meal from mcdonalds Darude - sandworm  ...these graphics are too crisp for console troopers. I hear the tech guild is working on a computer that is fast enough to perform this task. There is also a genetic cult that is looking into breeding this skill naturally into males. I have also heard of an invasion force of real fuckers that must have some kind of ftl, I'm not sure what it is.  And the fuckers are being chased by something else, so they must have ftl too.  Do you want a Butlerian Jihad?

Because that's how you get a Butlerian Jihad. Bad idea if you don't have a Gellar field to shield you from the horrors of the Warp... or maybe you actually enjoy communing with the vile denizens of Chaos, you HERETIC The spice must flow BY ENTERING A LITERAL HELLSCAPE, WHERE THE ONLY THING KEEPING A DAEMON FROM GNAWING YOUR FACE OFF IS A COMBINATION OF ANCIENT, POORLY-UNDERSTOOD TECHNOLOGY, AND PRAYERS TO A PSYCHIC, DECAYED CORPSE. The spoce must flew. "spoce" is obviously only 20% different that "spice".  Do you even math bro? in the 80s, we called it "spoice." Someone has a copyright on spice? For 400 gold maybe You spice bro?  Haha watched that 2 days ago and now immediately looked if someone here referenced that ;D good job (spice? spice?) They are overpowdered  [removed] you can but that is a gameplay mechanic. multiplayer may have been different with mods included  It's a tough ruleset to balance though, that's for sure. The whole tackling, ECM, ECCM, EW etc web can easily end up as either the most powerful combat system or as never-used fluff.

I'm glad it is intended to be a part of the game though! March it is then. January 2018. You heard it here first folks. I wish the people above saw this video too, its really awesome, to me as awesome or more as the other one.  Yeah, it really needs to be full screen and at 1080 fully buffered to catch it. "Near Future". EVE interdictors project a bubble around themselves, or drop a bubble generator. Seems to work pretty well. Damn, that might be it, haha.

Thanks For now they haven't overpromised on features afaik. They have been ... optimistic when it comes to release dates but in terms of actual features I don't think we have seen anything announced that was later confirmed it won't be coming r/mildlypenis Yes from the same event they showed both Console panic glitched the system. She's still active, just not on her blog/social media. Which is a good thing, because she used her blog as a means to cope with her depression. She's been more active in her life, and even gave a lecture/Q&A at JoCo Cruise 2016. She's also working on her second book. She found another dinosaur costume and was never heard from again.  No one wants to admit they ate nine cans of ravioli, but I did and I'm ashamed of myself. talk bout your 2 birds get stoned  Can we be friends with the Benedicts? FUCK YOU! I AIIIIIIIIIN'T HAVIN DAT SHIT. Well, for about 10 minutes. The flight is cool, but it's a bitch to fight anyone unless you buy a 75 dollar ship. The starter ship flies like it's a hippie van. Don't buy a mustang, they are really glitchy on the inside.

But, I guess. There's not too much content though. I would wait a few months if you were to buy it.

Also, they have free flight weekends every so often, so you can test out higher tiered ships. https://robertsspaceindustries.com/fly-now

> Starter packages include a ship and everything you need to play Star Citizen ***today***, as well as the full game upon release. No additional purchase required. Just a heads up, the star citizen sub is super active and is very helpful to new people. I hope cyberpunk is good. All I know is that I won't be pre-ordering it regardless of how much I love CDPR and the Witcher series.  To be fair they have their studio in Poland where expenses are extremely low, so they can sell their game for a normal price and make a good chunk more money than anyone in the US/Western Europe.

But on the other hand, yay for the best game of the year coming from my country and CDPR are fucking awesome. I'll definitely sacrifice all future EA, Ubisoft and Activision titles for the Cyberpunk 2077 to be as-good or even better than the Witcher 3. It's a no brainer, really. I'm finally *really* getting into the game. And holy shit. I honestly didn't think it was possible to have such depth in a game.  I have it, but I also have the 1 and 2, and I want to play through them first but 1 is just... hard to play. Will I be missing that much just skipping past them? Hell if 2 is better I'll just play that.

Edit: Thanks for the honest answers! Gta's DLCs are far from free, they are using the f2p model on a pay first game. Their business is in the people that buy silver cards for in-game money, and that is reflected by the astronomical prices everything has in-game. Unlucky is when Overwatch gets announced one month before release of your game. Knowing well before and releasing at the same time - plain stupid. and nothing of value was lost. All of them Roughly 8 on the Nvidia side and 9 on the AMD side. HL2: EP. 2 came out in 2007, the 8800 GT was one of the best cards at the time. I might be a little off but based on Nvidias website there's been 10 card generations since then. My daughter will be going off to college by the time HL3 comes out. 





She's 3 months old right now.  > That's what sounds familiar. 

Hyping a game sounds familiar?

https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/43uedv/was_the_halflife_2_hype_as_big_as_the_halflife_3/

/r/noshitsherlock Well they didnt deliver yet. The stuff will still be in the game they're just missing a deadline. You think you'll be able to afford a value meal after student loans! Ha... Haha... HAHAHAHAHA! (cries silently into neck deep pile of debt) /s

Edit: /s They are easily impressed, but they will soon be back, and with greater upscaling. Sounds great but can you write this in a beautiful prose that combines interesting philosophies on ecology on a planet scale with archaic religions come to life?  I've only read Frank's 6 books.  Is it worth it to continue reading any of the others? You just made me want to see a Dune/Warhammer 40k crossover, perhaps just Dune as a local system/region in the 40k 'verse.  Thou shalt not build a machine in the likeness of a human mind. Well apparently Star Citizen has Shai-Hulud already, so this seems probable. it's all fun and games until the warp spawns pour into your ship and your navigator loses sight of the Astronomican... I didn't know Friends was a WH40K prequel. I didn't notice the God Emperor there, though. Was it Gunther? I must not fire. Fire is the mimekiller. >that

Do you even word, bro? No idea.  
I made a funny remark.  
I already forgot what this was about.  
...  
Who are you?  
Where am I?   Buccaneers certainly come to mind. Once used to hinder Spanish trade in the Caribbean later turned on their English and Dutch masters.  In fiction, interdiction usually *is* the most effective form of combat due to surprise and typically superior numbers. Why would this not be the case in the game, barring issues with the targeted players being upset? The universe is supposedly populated 9:1 AI to human, so it may very well be completely fine. You could also tune it by only allowing it to be powered up for a short time per activation, forcing it to require some degree of skill and timing.

Ensure some guaranteed safe routes (that potentially take longer) or shorter routes that run the chance of interdiction. Seems pretty standard to me. Sounds like an Eve player. :) Well see if they are going for complete realism, balance should be a little off. Tech and defense to new stuff are always lagging somewhat.  Thing is I'm quite content with waiting on this game as long as it turns out to be what they promised. Take a much damn time as they need to do it right.

Edit: u/killerwin i think you opened up a can of worms :) I think even if it's released Jan '18 it's gonna not be even 3/4 finished. RemindMe! 5 years EVE, the only game where you get to hear grown men scream the word bubbles in anger. [deleted] Oh thats great. I was worried her blog disappearance was something more tragic. Then I'm she is doing well. Don't worry about it. Water under the fridge  *faint smile* You have been banned from /r/mustang Thanks for answering. Idk why gaming has such a problem with asking questions, so I appreciate it This is actually one of the few games I will prepurchase. Very few companies have my trust enough to preorder with these days, but CDPR is one of them. Blizzard is another. Um. Can't think of a third. =/ What expenses are lower in Poland than the US/Western Europe? Just curious. As someone in the games industry this would be good to know.

EDIT: Just checked programmer salaries in Poland. They look to be half or one third of the US. Considering labor is one of the largest dev costs, that's huge.

EDIT 2: I realize that cost of living is also lower. However, when trading with the rest of the world, foreign money goes farther in Poland. Selling a $60 game in the US gets you more in Poland than it does in New York. That's the only thing I mean. I didn't mean to imply anything about a standard of living, which is impossible to tell just from a salary number! I guess I should probably get around to playing Witcher 3. "Want this super fast new car??!?! Well just play for a few months straight and you can afford it!!!"

You mean I can't....

 "No...you can't just steal one as the game's name implies...."

Well....

"Shut the fuck up and buy shark cards!" Yup. That was planned by someone with more confidence than sense.

Blizzard are one of the few companies that competitors should avoid going into direct competition. They have money, resources and a reputation for releasing well planned and well executed games. Sure, there are hiccups Cough *Diablo 3 release* Cough, but on the whole, they produce solid games.

Whoever pushed for that release date should be reduced to janitorial duties. You sometimes don't have a choice. You have contractual obligations and have to pay your employees. The publishers should have worked something out. Uh, I was expecting NMS to be the example lol. Shits fucked.  Maybe with a touch of political philosophy?  Sure,  just make sure not to die before is complete,  ok? 

Ok And have Max von Sydow read it. Yes but are you ready for 10 pages that describe how subtly I move my eyebrow to convey a mixture of arrogance and despair? I loved this thread so fucking much. and then it to your son after you die, and he will totally screw it over turning it into shit? Many new machines on Ix. The mind of man is holy. 

For all its flaws im enjoying the expanded books. So, building a machine that is totally alien is a-ok...right? I think that's when the fun really starts though!
 Fire is the lil deaf that Bings total obfustication. Curses, foiled again... Spoce is a helluva drug. Also came to say he might be an Eve player. i think the "etc.. web" gave it away. He also sounds like he might be bitching about ECM being overpowered before it's even implemented.. DEFINITELY Eve player.. :)

#NerfStarCitizenSvipulEquivalent Cyno up! > Take a much damn time as they need to do it right.

Be careful what you wish for. Signed, /r/DayZ  RemindMe! 5000 years Being a tad optimistic there don't you think? Overwatch - Zarya

World of Warcraft - Paladins, at least when I played it was just them

Heroes of Newerth - Bubbles is a hero, he is a similar version of Puck from dota


I realise you're probably being facetious but I've seen this quote a lot recently (even girls on dating sites, fml.) and now it just annoys me 1. They were never cutscenes. In the first demo where they showed off planetary landings the camera zoomed out to give some glamour shots but the player was in control of their avatar the entire time that the flight assist guided the ship in to land.

2. This has only been done away with because the new procgen planets make it unnecessary. Yeah, replaced with landing tunnels which you have limited control in to bring your ship to ground. Supposedly, anyway. Well you actually land instead.  So that's better. Two hands in the bush are better than no birds at all. You have been made moderator of /r/corvette Pre-Alpha btw, so expect frame issues & random bugs.  I love the Fallout series, I pre-ordered Fallout 4. I wouldn't again given the oppertunity. Just wait, digital copies don't run out, they are not limited. Fromsoft Man how do people still not get it? This has nothing to do with trust. Developers shouldn't need your trust. They should be operating within budgets earned through selling games, not promises. By refusing to pre-order, you're letting the developers know that you'll only buy a well-crafted and finished product and that's it. If they want money from gamers, they're going to have to deliver a good game. We as gamers should not give development teams the option to survive off of hype. They need incentive to deliver on their promises. It's not just that, food prices and accommodation costs are lower, meaning that less money often buys more.  Pretty much.

They have all the advantages of a western european country with the low cost of living of an eastern european country.

I mean of course the lads over at CDPR are also sound or they wouldn't make such great games, but having to only pay a fraction of what others pay is huge. Also, Blizzard has fans like not many, if any other publishers/developers have.  I have encountered plenty of people (throughout my time in WoW, D3, & HotS) who almost exclusively play Blizzard games. Diablo 3 ended up being a pretty decent game, it just took a year to get decent. People forget how terrible online play was with Diablo 2 for the first 2 years  It was but one example in a long line of hyped games. He *is* the Kwisatz Haderach! Rolling Stone raves, *"Ten out of ten - an instant classic."* The New York Times describes it *"like a grittier, more grounded version of the original Star Wars movies, minus George Lucas."* The Onion proclaims *"Eh, it's alright."*

*Shit's Fucked*

Now in theaters. Rated R. On a scale of one broken arm to two broken arms how fucked are we talking about here? I will pace my fire.

I will alloy it to grass ovary and truly.

And when it has lawn grass I will turn the MRI to be its calf.

Where the fire cast lawn there will be muffins. Only I will see pain. I hear ramen is bad for cognitive functions over the long term, you might be a good case study. Thing is, CIG has actually developers that work. I mean, they redid an entire engine in less time than DayZ did (not to mention DayZ basically just redid the rendering, not the entire network code like CIG did) , whilst simultaneously creating a game from the ground up. They didn't have the luxury of using a preexisting map to play on, let alone all of the military assets. They implemented 64-bit precision, localized and nested physics grids, procedurally generated planets with incredibly detailed surfaces that are able to be explored with no loading screen and no fly by rails system... The list just goes on. 

I'd wager that CIG has put in as much work (with results) within a time frame of one year as the DayZ dev crew has on the games lifetime.  they really don't like it when you mention that its taken them like 5 years to add clothes I think Punkmaffles statement assumes they don't up and stop working on it.  In the late stages of your life, you will pass on your account to your children. And them to their progeny. In 5000 years, they will get the message.....and laugh. "We don't know much about him but he had a great sense of humour.". And they will ask the bot to remind in another thousand years. That mario game for the wii or wii u, can't remember which, wherein when shit goes down and you're the last one alive, all your friends are screaming "DON'T BUBBLE! DON'T FUCKING BUBBLE!!" Yea but that's an upgrade not a downgrade. 

EDIT: a word  Thats also actually false. The limited tunnel thing will only be on heavily populated planets with strict air control. Any of these vastly unpopulated planets you can enter and exit at any point. That and manual landings. Just have to get two birds stoned at once and server wipes every now and then.  "frame issues" is putting it lightly. Fuck planets and sand worms, I want to play with more than 30 fps on a 1070 > digital copies don't run out

Back in the day I used to pre-order because of this exact issue.  Games would actually be impossible to find on shelves day of release.  That is a problem of the past, I have no reason to pre-order / reserve copy anymore.  It also doesnt help that 99% of the time "PREORDER NOW AND GET EXCLUSIVE X-Y-Z!"  becomes available to everyone after the first month or two. this is exactly the best reason to never preorder $100 for some mini-figs that sit on a shelf by my TV? Sign me the fuck up.  
Wife loves the "Tales" series of JRPGs, I'm a sucker for Disgaea;  We have made many preorders from these two series.  

But a regular/standard edition? Not a chance. Yeah, but being from Eastern Europe myself, I can say the wage difference is a double edge sword, as while the company do have less cost, there is a high number of talented programmers and engineers going abroad to earn the money they easily can.    

It usually takes something special to get a lot of the top people to stay. Either to (almost) match the salary, or to have a project people really want to work on, which is what i suspect CDPR uses, Im one of them. Its honestly not even because I try to be a fan boy of them. They just have legitimately great games with high replay value like none other.   
  
I don't play them all, but I own them all and enjoyed them all for at least a while. And if I get bored with whatever "main game" im currently playing, another blizzard game is usually my go to.  
  
For example, I play WoW a lot, when an expansion gets old while waiting for the next, ill pick up D3. D3 is a game I can play for short bursts. An absolute blast beginning of a season, but will get old after a while as well, so then I can play SC2, hearthstone, and overwatch as fillers until a new WoW expansion comes out or a new D3 season comes out, then they are fresh as ever once again.  
  
They are constantly updating their games to add content which makes them feel new so its hard to get bored. And when you already have time and experience in a game, you can jump right into the high end action without a learning curve associated with completely new games.  
  
And the biggest reason is the online ability of all their games. Never been big on single player games, but all blizzard games I can join thousands of others playing right along side me. You can get immersed into a game that isn't just AI, its real live people who are part of the game itself.  Paradox is the only company I can think of with an equally loyal following.  At least this time we have someone at the helm who has good experience making awesome space games. (Freelancer) Yeah, those are kill words! Khaine's Gate fucked. One arm broken in two places. Incest I can quit anytime man.... As someone who works in the industry, the scope of what they are doing is unprecedented. Its a weird anomaly with a consciousness of passionate 90s dev with the structure, technology and money of today's gaming industry. I don't think we'll have many of those games that pushes limits just because they can, it's unnecessary risk in a now mature industry. Last one I can think of was WoW when it launched and I can bet we'll wait at least another decade to have something like it again.  Of course they don't, that's like saying it took CSGO almost 5 years to add sprays. It's not that linear a development process. But it wasn't just clothes?

Huge additions to the map plus Elektro/Cherno was re-designed

Tons of weapons/clothing/gear


Working vehicles


New rendering engine/weather


Partial base-building


Persistence

I do agree that it's been abysmally slow but spreading hyperbole isn't nice either.


edit:and a lot of minor stuff like zombie models, health system, ballistics/sound etc


2nd edit: I've seemed to just cause a lot of arguing, just check the changelogs or play the game yourself if you already have it, no it isn't done or anywhere near promised but it isn't a piece of shit that got abandoned after it made shit tons of money either. I thought that would have been a given in this context. The cutscene landings were never meant for unpopulated planets if memory serves.  We'll bring that cross when we come to it.  To be fair, in the Puniverse right now everyone gets 30fps.  From a 1060 to a Titan XP.  It's a server side issue they have a pretty good handle on.  A fix is on slate for 2-6 months from now depending on how quickly they are stabilize the planned fix (dynamic culling of relevant data transferred server -> client -> server on a need-to-know basis far more strict than base Cryengine). Total opposite of wolfenstein. Lol I just hate when difficulty means "All the enemies now take 6 shots to kill instead of 3, and you die if a fly breathes on you" Another game that does that well is Deus Ex Human Revolution, where Easy is "give me a story", Normal is "give me a challenge" and hard is "give me Deus Ex". They really do understand me; I just want to mindlessly slaughter and feel like a god.

That's why I love Diablo so much. Often, I just want to play a game for the story line. I don't want to do the same thing over and over because I keep dying. Sometimes I have an hour to play a week.

Not going to play the same area twice because I died. I played the entire mass effect series on casual. I was just there for the story, didn't want combat to hold it back This is nice to see.  Not everyone needs soul crushing difficulty to stay engaged. Now I'm curious about what the other difficulties say... This is exactly why I tend to play Civ 5 on settler most of the time.  Yes... Settler.  Oh, and of course I have the game set to quick, 5 billion years old (super flat and easy to move across), with abundant resources, and no barbarians.  Its pretty much a version of Civ a 5 year old could play and win with ease. 

After a stressful day at work I don't want to engage in difficult strategy... I just want to steamroll the map as Washington and unleash my frustrations on the poor digital civs that happen to get stuck on my map. 

No complicated thinking involved, no planning out ahead of time, no worrying about money and happiness... just mindlessly clicking while the minimap slowly turns blue.  

Occasionally on the weekend Ill play at a higher difficulty but 95% of the time I play on settler and I love it.  I am not ashamed to admit that. 

EDIT: I forgot about my favorite thing when playing on Settler.  Getting all chummy with a civ and trading one of their cities in exchange for a massive amount of money and resources... then declare war to negate my part of the trade but keep the city.  

Ill pick a small city in a prime location (mainly in a location that will set me up to destroy the other civs with bombers or has a resource I need) and trade hundreds of gold and a ton of resources each turn to get the city.  Ill wait a few turns until Im allowed to build new things in the new city, purchase a barracks, Armory, a few planes, and a few defensive units then declare war on the civ I traded with.  Now I have the city and most of my resources intact.    

Everyone hates me after that but what are they going to do about it?   *insert evil laugh here*.  I tend to find myself playing on the equivalent of Hard in most games, but I have never understood the superiority think they have when they brag about playing on harder modes. Not everyone is as good; maybe the challenge presented to some people in Easy is the same as the challenge you get on max difficulty? Difficulty in my opinion should be used to tune the game to that perfect balance of challenge and fun. 

Personally I don't enjoy the steamroll approach the picture suggests, but if you do go for it! I play a lot of games on easy, and people always want to give me shit for it. I get why you would want something challenging, but I like to relax while I play.  And then Katherine is sitting over there like,"Having a hard time? Try playing on easy...NOPE! Still fucking hard as shit!" Maybe when I was a college kid with tons of free time, sure I'd play on hard.

But after working 9 hors, commuting 2 hours, then wrestling with kids' dinner/showers and doing chores and realizing I only have 45 min before I need to be asleep.... shit yea you bet I'm putting that thing on the easiest of easy modes. This games is like that supportive older brother everyone wanted but never got This reminds me of Halo 3's description of easy mode which read "The game basically plays itself" feel like there's an 'an' missing from that sentence This how I feel about sports games. My friends give me a hard time for playing on rookie with a maxed out character. If i wanted to fail at sports I would just go outside and actually try playing them.  They forgot to list "suck at videogames", which is the reason I play on easy. I wish I could blame a long exhausting day at work. Easy is relative. XCOM games will still force-feed a newbie their own face. This is fucking spot on. 
I am 41 now and I am lucky to get 30 minutes to play a game these days. The last thing I want to do is battle the portion of stubborn level over and over for that small amount of time. 

I've had my days of legendary. I set it to easy now so I can see a larger portion of the game since I may not get back to it for months.  I'll take a longer, easier game over a shorter game which generates its length through difficulty, any day.

My ideal games are where you generate the challenge yourself. The base game itself can be pretty simple and easy, such as Tetris. But once you start getting real good at it, it progressively gets harder and harder. Get into your 30s and this gets all too true. Reminds me of this great philosopher:

"Look, for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra, and sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, you know, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything's gonna turn out okay."

--BoJack Horseman This used to be my logic for always picking easy, but then I started amping up difficulty and I feel more satisfied afterwards. 

Admittedly, sometimes it's rage inducing. The last boss in the Blood and Wine dlc, for example, was 1 hitting me through quen. I had to put the game down for a day or so. After I came back refreshed and stomped his ass, every sidestep perfect, it was all worth it I like this. I've never been great at games, and it kind of pisses me off when the game makes fun of me for playing on easy Speaking of difficulty levels, Postal 2had a nice spectrum of [difficulty levels](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/postal/images/6/67/Diffic.png/revision/latest?cb=20140704203426). I think the biggest problem with hard games isn't that they are hard, it's that they make failure boring. They often just make you do the same part over and over until you get it right, when what they should be doing is make you look for easier ways to advance. I personally really enjoy playing exploration based RPGs on super high difficulties because it makes the quest for power feel like it has meaning. It has to be a game that allows you to get so powerful that enemies you had to run from before become easy though. My friends are always giving me shit for playing on easy mode. Some times you just want to destroy everything and feel invincible. Or you could just do it like Ninja Gaiden on Xbox where if you die more than 3x on the first level it changes the difficulty to 'Ninja Dog'... Spot on.    I want to enjoy a story and experience something I don't do normally.   It's not my job,  it's not my life.   I game for entertainment. 

Sometimes I'll play hard but a lot of times I just want to see a game's story,  not be challenged by repetitive enemies. 

PS fuck games that don't let you change difficulties mid game.  I agree. When I get off work I just want to relax and get my mind off things. Not build up stress and anger on super hard difficulties lol.  I wish more gameplay difficulties were smarter. More often then not harder difficulties just slap extra HP, damage, or resources onto the AI and it's basically just like playing against a kid with cheats.

I like playing Normal mostly because I don't like the AI getting artificial bonuses that gap close. For instance, higher difficulty Civ games in my opinion SUCK because they invalidate what you can do. Want that great library? Better turn the difficulty down otherwise you can do everything right but the AI gets it anyways because it's got a bunch of bonuses.

Higher difficulties should make the game harder without making the AI cheat. What if I just want the AI to not play so damned passive and actually war dec me? Why do I need to give them cheat bonuses just to get the AI to TRY to beat me? Yes exactly. A lot of gamers are just in it for the experience, not a competition.  Finally! Developers who actually get it. 👏🏻 I play Skyrim on Novice for this reason. The combat isn't particularly engaging whether it's on easy or expert, I just want to build my character and explore, which takes long enough already.  I appreciate this. About 90% of the time I play games (except for sequels where I'm familiar with the mechanics) just for the story the first time around. 

If the game has some kind of replay value, I'll go back and play it through harder difficulties. 

I have to set a time limit on my gaming, so I prefer a way to immerse myself for the time rather than grind away.  This is a prime reason Shadow Warrior 2 is about to get bought by me.

I've never understood the shaming of gamers who don't like hard difficulty. While I'm not saying games should have "Press X to skip to next cutscene", I primarily play games to unwind, and too high of a challenge turns me away pretty quickly.

I actually *like* feeling like a superhero, and I enjoy the fact that games offer easy modes to facilitate that.

On the other hand, just to let people know, I also play Cod and other FPS in online multiplayer, so it's not that I'm afraid of losing, or that I have a rage problem or something else armchair psychologists might like to assume for me. Other than that, I've never had much motivation to play games that liked to deride "easy" players, such as pretty much anything that Tomonobu Itagaki has touched. I still remember when I died one too many times on Ninja Gaiden and was put into "Ninja-dog Mode", I think I made it to the end of that level and then quit.

At the end of the day, not everyone plays for the sheer challenge, and it's nice to see games acknowledging that. Love games that have the same rewards or achievements no matter the difficulty setting.  Heck, I actually enjoy the story more if it is on Easy because I am not rage quitting every 2 minutes. I play some games on easy to get through the game quickly. I have too much of a backlog to spend time grinding and dying on every single game I want to play. For instance, for some reason I never had played any God of War games until I picked them all up at Gamestop a few months ago. If I had time, I would gladly go through the harder difficulty, but I just want to get through the storyline while experiencing the game so I play on easy. 

On other games that are near and dear to my heart like Kingdom Hearts, Persona, or Final Fantasy, I will gladly grind and 100% completion whore because those games are my favorites. Yep. Once I got older and got a job, I started to play my RPGs on easy. Just so I can run through the story line and get a feel for the gameplay.

After completion though I find myself playing certain missions on higher difficulties. But I don't have the time investment to bang my head against a wall for hours anymore. Not because I wont wake up early enough to get to work. But because I don't want to feel mentally drained at work all day I play most single player games on easy or normal... if a game is just going to make things bullet sponges to make it harder I don't need to waste my time with that. I heard it described as a "content tourist."  Sometimes I like being that tourist. I just do it for the story, I play games for story most of the time not the combat I enjoy playing Ninja Gaiden black on hard because I like going to bed angry and feeling like I accomplished nothing.  Exactly! I accomplish enough in life I don't need validation from a video game anymore. thank you!  i ALWAYS play on easy for those reasons. I just want to be mind numb as I blast demons or whatever enemy I'm against.  Don't annihilate me with throngs of 20+ enemies. Just let me enjoy myself.  The dark souls community is the worst about this.    
"so yeah i think boss x is pretty tough, he gave me alot of trouble."    
"LOL U SUCK GIT GUD I KILL HIM ON SL1 NAKED STOP PLAYING DARK SOULS U DISGRACE" Any platformer with Easy Mode needs a jumping puzzle option so after you fall the fifth time it says, "Do you just want to spawn over there?" Yes, and playing on the hardest difficulty isn't just to prove something either.  It's for people who actually find it relaxing and fun to have a challenge. Same thing with mass effect. You have a specific mode if you want the combat to be a breeze and want to focus on the story part. Yay for devs who understand casuals! :) As some with mental health issues and who uses games as a form of escapism from a shitheel of a brain who constantly wants me to be miserable or longs for death, I had to give up on higher difficulty in games a long time ago. I appreciate a dev. that does this, who does not mock you for your choices or just because you want to live a story. I just wish achievements were not tied to difficulty levels. It sucks to not be able to "complete" a game achievement wise when usually four of them are devoted to different levels of difficulty.  Im playing Witcher 3 right now on easy and have no regrets, pretty sure I played 2 on easy as well. 

Just trying to enjoy the story and see some titties :) Right i just like to relax and chill out playing. I wanna enjoy myself not get angry or frustrated Just like many other people, I play "easy" for the story. It's the best when you can fine-tune difficulties (like in Skyrim, it had a ton), I love when the game is challenging but not frustrating. After I've finished the story, I can play on a harder difficulty if I liked the game and want a serious challenge. But unless difficulty is a part of the game's mechanic, I am going to play on easy because dying all the time kind of breaks the immersion. Especially if a game is focused on telling a story, I want it to be an interactive movie basically.

EDIT: I knew I forgot something. I have to admit that I often also cheat in **singleplayer** games. Tons of people say that it's stupid, people who do that are idiots and don't know how to play etc. But I think that the point of games is to enjoy yourself, so who the fuck cares if you play one-handed blindfolded legendary or cheat your way through easy. It's singleplayer, you're not breaking anyone's experience, there's nothing to be mad about. As an example, I find grinding one of the most annoying things, so I'm happy whenever it can be skipped. And I don't see a reason to yell that people who enjoy grinding are wasting their life or such. If they enjoy it, they're not wasting any second of their time. I applaud the description for the most part, except for the implication that all those playing on harder difficulties are trying to 'prove' something.  

That's true for some, e.g. Achievement/leaderboard nuts, but I know I only play on harder difficulties now after 20+ years of gaming because easy games are just too boring to bother with.  I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in that. This is EXACTLY why I play on easy mode now. I have no time to repeatedly replay sections, and I feel like god damn Jack Bauer when I do it. Nice to see a game doesn't shame someone for choosing an easy difficulty. Too many games, at least in the past, would question your abilities if you chose to play on a lower difficulty.

Personally, I play to relax and de-stress, and my days of throwing controllers across the room are over. I don't need to be frustrated by games anymore.

Last time playing a game on Insane difficulty was impressive I was a dateless wonder of a High School Freshman and had a lot of time to do f*** all.
 Nailed it.

I literally bought DS3 to get good. 

Yeah, I know. Games in the past were fucking unbeatable even in Easy, like Megadrive and SNES games. Deus Ex and Witcher 3 also did this well by emphasizing that the easy difficulty is basically for the story only, but this matches how I've always seen it myself, heroic. Honestly, I play Skyrim & Fallout 4 on god mode a lot of the time. I work a lot, I'm tired. I just want to vegetate, fuck around, and feel like a badass. I have lots of fun, and I play it like an RPG - I get into character, I make decisions based on that particular character's personality/motivations and all that, and I don't have to worry about getting my ass handed to me. Didn't gamers freak out when some game had a mode that was basically 'I mainly want the story make the gameplay short and easy'?  I totally agree with this mentality. Used to play every game on the hardest level, then I realized I don't really enjoy that. I play games mostly for good story or for interesting gameplay and hard does not equal interesting for me when I have limited amount of time and want to maximize the fun. I notice this myself as the years advance ^^ As a student I would always play on the harder difficulties yet now I'm more interested in the story or plain, quick fun before i have to do all that grown up stuff. facerolling mechanics and ignoring gameplay elements isnt very fun though...

imagine dark souls if you didnt have to dodge/block anything, and you had infinite estus and stamina.  it would suck, cause you are removing the rewarding aspect of playing the game well/overcoming challenges. I wish every game understood this. 

Someone tell Bungie about this amazing development, people playing games to have fun and not be tryhards! Simply astounding! Fuck yes. Sometimes I bust my ass and I need to feel like Superman for an hour.  If more games' hard modes translated to more than just damage buffs/debuffs and HP counts, I'd play more of them.  Too many developers kinda cheap out on what should be *tactically and strategically* more complexity in gameplay.  

Diablo 2 adding in scaling immunities and resistances, for example, made Nightmare and Hell difficulties more engaging (except when you run into Immune to Magic & Immune to Physical... That RNG was murder sometimes). The missing "an" in front of "exhausting day" is causing a significant degree of eye twitch for me right now. My favorite difficult mode labels were in the game Blood 2 - 

Genocide  
Homicide  
Suicide   I don't think many modern games deal with difficulty as good as they did 10 or 15 years ago.  I like to feel threatened like I might die fairly fast but I don't like having to unload a full mag into someone just to kill them.  I thought the first Crysis handled this well.  I think they called it realistic mode.  The enemies weren't bullet sponges (at least the human ones) and I wasn't invincible.  Fun times stealthing my way around the map taking out the enemy one at a time. I mostly play games on normal or easy, I get bored with a game after  a couple days of playing. If I havent beaten by then, then its a good chance I'll just move on and not play again for months, if ever again.

Only very rare games can hold me the whole time. This is nice, because yes - sometimes I play games to feel like a superhero. Other times I want to die repeatedly.  I tend to play high difficulty in most games, just because I like the challenge, especially if it's a strategy game, but I also know how to accept defeat, I'm looking at you XCOM. I played that on normal, loved it, and never looked back

Edit: Swypos I wish life had an easy level.  That's all I'd ever play -- making bank, getting pussy, jet setting in leisure around the world.   

nah I'd probably just play video games I play games for story mostly, unless it's an MMO, so nothing wrong with easy story on single player It's amazing to me that we still use this incredibly broken system for choosing difficulty. This screen alone makes me interested in the game, because the designers clearly understand the core/casual fallacy

Gods Will Be Watching is another game that gets this whole "decide how hard you want the game to be without any context" thing right. 

There's the Normal mode, Light mode (which basically increases your margin of error) Puzzle mode (which removes rng) Puzzle Light mode (larger margin for error and no rng) and Narrative mode (read a book but click instead of turn pages). It's till not perfect (in puzzle modes anything with a progress bar absolutely has to go to 100% before you can do anything) but by calling the modes something other than "easy" "normal" and "hard" it makes it easier for "hardcore" gamers without a lot of time on their hands to actually get through the game. 

Also it's hard as fuck, so the various modes help you get a beautiful story.  I like playing on easy because the story mode feels more like a movie.

I think it's nice. I wasn't aware people played on higher difficulties than easy because they needed to prove something to themselves.  I thought we played on higher difficulties because games are boring as shit on easy. I love this game so much but I'm stuck at only about 63% completion without an objective.  I just fought Kamiko's body for the second time, what the hell do I do next? Does it call you a giant pussy again? I do wonder if they'd have done that if it wasn't a reference to Wolf 3D's settings... Pretty sure Wolfenstein does this in a tongue-in-cheek way though. Metal Gear Solid V also. They make you wear a chicken mask for the remainder of the mission. Ninja Gaiden as well. To even unlock it you have to die a bunch of times in normal, then you get "ninja dog" mode. If I remember right the dialogue in game actually changes and they treat you like a weakling.  This is my issue with most Bethesda game's difficulties. All they do is up the dmg % and reduce your defense %. The end result is you getting cheap shot by a stray fireball or Molotov cocktail while emptying an entire clip into a normal enemies face and they still stand.

The best harder difficulties are the ones that increase damage on both sides and add additional dangers or enemies to the normal game. Yeah, this is usually why i don't go above the "normal" difficulty on a lot of games. I love when a game is challenging through the mechanics and world design but not when enemies are just damage sponges.  This is one of the reasons I like the Metro games. Higher difficulty means you die quicker, but so do enemies. In addition, you receive less ammo, and some difficulties remove parts or the entirety of your HUD. And then there's Ninja Gaiden That's better than playing Aladdin or Lion King on the Sega Genesis. No difficulties, but the game is just fucking impossible. This is why I like dark souls. There is no difficulty setting, its hard but the damage is balanced. I love when they give difficulties cool names. I still can remember Halo 2's description for Legendary with the sick Sanghelli head on the badge.

"You face opponents that have never known defeat, who laugh in alien tongues at your efforts to survive. This is suicide."

That's what I call giving some background to why I want to beat the story in the hardest difficulty. Great immersion + sense of accomplishment Newest game has "I never asked for this". Yes! I was trying to remember what game did this haha the witcher had something similar, just the story, sword and story and 2 other things

pretty cool In the new one, the highest difficulty is called "I Never Asked For This" [Don't forget Back.](http://i.imgur.com/CuQojSv.jpg) That implies that easy and normal are not the real thing though. I have a "personal rule" that if I'm supposed to be a super soldier killing machine 1980s action star type character, I'll turn the difficulty *down* and enjoy being the most badass motherfucker in the Galaxy


like with Halo, Mass Effect, the Arkham games (Batman shouldn't get hit once fighting 10+ low level thugs)




but if I'm supposed to be some regular schmuck, I won't mess with the difficulty


usually horror games, but also applicable to most "modern shooters"




 ...



can't say I've ever purposely turned *up* the difficulty of a game, on the first playthrough at least I think we have played different Diablos... I like games that let you change the difficulty freely. In a lot of "Tales of.." games you can turn the battle difficulty up or down whenever you want, which is nice for particularly annoying bosses or dungeons that you're sick of replaying. Deus Ex: Human Revolution had a difficulty called "Tell me a story" for that exact reason. I feel the same way. 
Most of the time if the game I'm playing is going to be 100+ hours, RPGs like dragon age, I always play at normal or lower  difficulty because it's already going to take forever to finish so I don't want to double my play time and create a ton of frustration, when I just want to enjoy the play through. . 

On the other hand I always play FPS game on hard or higher. They are a little shorter and they are more about challenging my skills directly.  

But there is no reason to feel like you shouldn't play at a low difficulty. A friend of mine is super casual and plays everything on the lowest he can. Whenever I am at his place gaming I can't even believe he can have fun like that, but he doesn't give a shit because that's fun for him.  I hate playing FF games, but I like watching someone else go through the story. That was me with Witcher 3 at first. I fucked up and didn't have any food or anything and I kept getting killed by the wild hunt in a pretty early mission so I switched it to easy to pass that part. It's also a nice feature when you can change the difficulty mid game.  That's why I wish games had cheat codes still. I just want to unwind and blow shit up. If I hit a really hard boss and have to try ten times to get it, I'm not having fun any more. Usually I can find a trainer or something if I really have to but it's risky. I like how GTAV let's you skip a mission if you die a bunch of times *Viking Conquest* was like this for me.

I would come home, get captured by bandits fifty times, and knock the difficulty down because I'm not using my few hours of free time to play as an Irish slave. The reason I am currently playing Witcher 3 on "just the story" difficulty. It's so much more enjoyable for me personally when I don't have to focus super hard and just get enjoy the brilliant writing and graphics.  I also like games that are hard without making you die over and over. I'm starting to love the idea of permadeath I also play for the story but also for the challenge. I pretty much always put on the highest difficulty. I like the IDEA of Dark Souls. I do not like actually PLAYING Dark Souls. Try telling the people over at /r/dontstarve that - they'll crush you for not playing exactly by the rules. It's ridiculous haha. same, but also with Dragon Age...


I really don't play Bioware games for their combat  Especially since, aside from the phoned-in ending, combat was the weakest point of the series in my opinion. Making it more frustrating hardly adds to the experience. I did it for the acheezements, but my play-through on easy was more enjoyable. Heh, I like that the only direct response to your comment is ridiculously downvoted...

But I feel the same way. I've played games like Mass Effect on their highest difficulty for the challenge...but it's generally only after I've played through the main storyline once or twice. I don't always have a lot of free time and sometimes I just wanna come home and, like the post said, "feel like a goddamn superhero." Honestly, I've been playing video games for nearly two decades, and I still consider myself bad at them. I took 2 years to beat dark souls 1 on a second character, which I only did because a friend and I started taking Friday nights to take turns playing the character(this is super fun and if any of you out there are interested in the Souls series but don't like the frustration, find someone to do this with)

I play games practically every day for at least some time, but I'm still consistently mediocre, and I have accepted that. This is what easy modes and LPs are for, so I don't have to wait my time and money on a game I can't beat, because at this point I'm not going to suddenly "git gud".  You requested, I delivered: http://i.imgur.com/CxIaIek.png I think it's cool people enjoy a game the way they want to play it, that is the way it should be! Thumbs up for the Civ 5 shout out I LOVE that game. Personally I prefer Emporer, hard enough where I might lose a city but easy enough to win the game with any civ given any circumstance. As they say "Different strokes for different folks". Cheers! I used to do the same thing, but I found a much better way to play (for me at least).

What I do is play on a much higher difficulty, but I have the In Game Editor mod running. The reason for the higher difficulty is that the A.I. seems to be a lot more interactive, so they might bully you a bit more or they'll use different strategies and expand; so they aren't just kind of dead in the water.

When things get a bit too hectic or I need an advantage, I just use the IGE. I know I'm going to win, but it's the scenarios playing out before me that are fun. I agree, i do the same damn thing! I like rewriting history (Guns first used in 750AD, first nuke dropped on Jerusalem (for no goddamn reason at all, that i care to mention) in 1500AD. I have no problem playing the game like this. I feel the same way, but recently I've been trying to bump it up a few difficulty settings. Not so much that the game becomes hard, mind you -- just enough so that when I eventually steamroll all other cities, they put up a modicum of resistance, and it feels *that* much more satisfying to crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and to hear the lamentations of their women. Crushing AI is a lesson in how to feel like a badass. I play Total War on easy. I'm terrible at those sorts of games. They can be very frustrating and that is the last thing I want in my video games. I like to conquer the lands, its really relaxing and satisfying when it all goes my way.

Even if I know I stacked the deck, I still enjoy myself.  You are not alone... It really depends on the game man. After playing Guitar Hero on expert, going back to easy is boring af and I always attempt to get people to play higher difficulties once I think they're ready. The only issue is when people get up their own ass over their skill. The saying "My standards are not your standards" works well in this case. Well, people wanting to brag about being good at something is hardly surprising; fairly natural human impulse.

My greatest frustration is how non-standard difficulty levels are across video games; on some games, you can crank it all the way up to the highest difficulty level and still not get much of a challenge; in others, normal mode is quite challenging and setting it to hard on your first playthrough is a mistake.

Another issue lies in the fact that making difficulty levels for a lot of games is basically impossible without totally redesigning the game; platformers are an obvious example, but there's a lot of games where you simply cannot readily adjust the difficulty level because the way the game works is the way it works, and challenges are built around playing it a certain way. It's great that a lot of games give you the option of catering to difficulty. When I played the latest Wolfenstein, I went for the hardest setting because I felt the old school vibe and wanted to feel challenged. If I play anything made by bioware, I usually play on the easier settings because I'm more interested in the story than the combat. It all depends on what YOU want out of the experience, not what other people think is an acceptable standard.

The only time I ever advocate higher difficulties is if someone wants to get better at the game. Back in the days of Halo 3, my friends advised me to beat the campaign on Legendary to get better at the multiplayer, and they were right. The higher stakes trains you to think faster, to be more precise with your aim and to make use of the environment when in a firefight. On the lower settings, you weren't required to have tactical sense or have the aim of the dude from the Navy Seals copypasta, but on Legendary it was mandatory. The same thing works for strategy games too, if you can beat the AI on higher difficulties then you'll think differently when playing against other players. It's almost as if the game designers know this and built in a method to cater to different gaming styles. Everything doesn't have to be super difficult, sometimes you just want to get the story and feel like a god. I prefer calling Catherine's "Easy" difficulty "Playable Mode", because fuck not having an Undo option in a high-stress puzzler with clunky control and instadeath. Easy was harder because if I got stuck, the guides were for normal mode and above for the most part They actually had to patch in a secret Super Easy mode that is just Easy mode with a special item that lets you jump up multiple blocks at once. And boy does it ever. You can stand in the middle of a battlefield and just let your shields recharge, regardless of how much you get shot. I'm not sure you actually die in that mode.

 Lmfao I once beat this entire campaign with one of my best buddies ever, he is not a gamer and I still remember the feeling of comradery and accomplishment we both shared.....

Which was promptly deflated upon reading the description of the difiiculty.

Im pretty sure it includes the phrase "make your enemies cower and flee from your might" or something along those lines. i just got an xbox one and the halo mcc. been playing on easy and halo 3 i didnt even have to try to find cover, its almost like they couldnt kill you. i think i died once in the whole halo 3 campaign and im pretty sure it was my own fault. Been doing this for years in baseball. Character at 99 stats, broke the records for home runs, stolen bases etc for a single season and for career. I play music or watch let's plays or something while I zone out on rookie Most people (like me) who play's sports games around the all-star/superstar difficulty level don't do it for a challenge or a sense of achievement. We just want to play a game that feels like the real thing, winning and losing not only belongs in sports, it's an essential part of it. This is me :|  
I found like... 3 games I'm really awesome at, but the rest? It's like what's the point? Especially online. Lookin' at you CS:GO. I've played XCOM on a few difficulties, easy tends to not fuck you over even when you do everything right. oh man that sniper shot missed

QUICKLOAD SAVE I never understood why people think XCOM games are naturally hard, even without save-scumming every 2 turns. The hardest part is having a 10% chance of a bullet hitting one of your units actually hit, the bullshit RNG is the absolute hardest part on the lower difficulties whereas on the higher difficulties the AI is a 2k ELO chess player. I'm actually playing a lot of 7 days to Die and one of the things I love about that game is that you can fine-tune the game (xml editing) to your liking to an absurd degree. 
No fast zombies, no animal or special zombies (just the old school slow zombies) the loot has the frequency I want, hunger and thirst drop at a rate I find appropriate... I LOVE when a game gives you so much liberty to customise how much of a challenge you want it to be.  [deleted] I'm not even 20 yet and this is true Turned 30 this year. I had to quit raiding in warcraft and only have limited time for each game. I definitely agree with you. Being an adult sucks. When a game does scaling difficulty correctly, playing on hard or whatever can be a lot of fun. When it's just a matter of enemies having more health and doing more damage, hard pass. That's almost always boring. God I remember playing back when I was new to those action style games and I still got my ass handed to me on Ninja Dog.  
Had an Older cousin who could play on the hardest pretty flawlessly and if blew my mind haha  
  
Thanks for bringing that game up those were fond memories I haven't thought of in a long time! Well put. I play singleplayer for the story. If I wanted a challenge, I'd play multiplayer. Which I do.  That's right Timmy! You play you're xstation on whatever setting you like. I think "New Super Mario Bros Wii" did this, if you died about 5 times, the game asked you if you wanted to skip the segment you were stuck on. You must like games like Mass Effect. If you do enjoy story, try the TellTale games  I'm not sure why this was down voted, but I've got your back Easy mode is "Can I play, daddy!" and your icon is the main character with a dummy in his mouth. Hell, Wolfenstein calls you a giant pussy when you exit the game. Would it really be Wolfenstein if they changed up the names of the difficulty levels though? They're part of the fabric of the franchise at this point, similar to DOOM.  Yeah, the old Doom games did it, too. [Yep.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/f7/fb/27/f7fb27926a193e1f4b9bff4bf3ceff6e.jpg) That's my issue with Arma. Instead of young the AI's smartness they just increase their accuracy

Easy= 5 shots until they land a hit

Normal= 3

Hard= 2 

Then Veteran is 1 shot head shots so long as you don't get a drop on them. I'm not kidding I did a test on this and even watched a video on it  Just curious, how would you prefer to make a Bethesda style game more difficult? I'd imagine making the AI smarter to a significant degree would be extremely difficult to do. I remember trying to start that game on the hardest and having no hud at all. I think I lasted 20 minutes before toning it down a notch.  Not to mention the bonus 'reward' cinematic at the end of the games if beaten on "legendary." Not to mention intimidating. That was always one of my most favorite things about halo when I was younger. Bungie has always been great with flavor text. And man, was Halo 2 "Legendary" a challenge. 

It was just completely insane. Get out of cover, and in half a second your shield is out due to the crossfire of five overheating plasma rifles, and you have three plasma grenades flying in your direction.  Then you get auto killed by jackals with snipers from half the level away.  That's hardcore mode tho. If you die, you restart. Which is ironic because if you're playing at that difficulty level you actually did ask for it. >the witcher had something similar, just the story, sword and story and 2 other things

>pretty cool

Blood and Broken Bones

Death March Games with multiple difficulties are often designed overall with one difficulty in mind, then the other difficulties are minor alterations such as enemy numbers and stats. So yes, hard mode may very well be the "real" thing. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy the others. I always laugh at RPG's where you are some ''chosen hero'' literally send by god and some ''brave warrior'' and then you set one step in the open world and you get killed by a snail.  
  
Like really? Are you sure about your choice god? Me? Diablo III, at least the last time I played, rewards you more for playing on lower Torment levels and cutting through more volume, so I always felt like a god when I played.

Diablo 2 pre-1.10 was super easy, now I think it has good difficulty.

And in Diablo 1... there was so much hacking, even *other* players hacking *my* items without me wanting them to that I was unintentionally a god there as well. God yes, especially since you'll be doing just fine on one of the higher difficulties for normal fights but start getting your ass kicked in indescribable fashion once you hit a boss. Going up one difficulty level is the difference between attending a tea party for little girls and half your party getting one-shot by the boss's mystic arte. The Last Of Us and many Need For Speed games also did this, and I was thankfull for that. I like to play on hard, but some stages can just be frustrating and aren't fun anymore. I've appreciated this for the Elder Scrolls games. Small groups of weak enemies can still be challenging while large cheap-as-fuck enemies can be toned down if you so wish.  Titanfall 2 lets you do this in the campaign. It's really nice when you've accidentally wallrunned too far and jumped into a group of 12 enemies on master difficulty - and it triggers a checkpoint right before you die I loved The World Ends With You for this. You could at any time change the level of the enemies from 1-99, change the level of AI your teammate would be controlled by, and change the difficulty, in addition to the fact that all of the random encounters are manually triggered, and you could chain up lots of high level fights for a really high loot drop rate if you were collecting, or just fight for fun for a while and level yourself up. You don't realize why those difficulties exist until you try to get somebody who has never played video games in their life into gaming.  I let my niece play Ocarina of Time on my 3DS and she couldn't even walk straight enough to get Link to jump off ledges. She actually spent a few minutes trying to figure out what the jump button was because she was so consistently not jumping off edges she was running off of.

The point is, I introduced her to the game because I remember it being a very casual game that was more story and puzzle-based rather than difficult.  Turns out everything is difficult if you can't even figure out how to control your character. And it's still kind of challenging, up to a point that is  I always do easiest because I play for story and nothing else. If the difficulty does not add to the story in any meaningful way then it's a pointless option. I don't want to die 100 times on a single boss because I don't care enough to get an achievement (really those things are dumb to me). And say I do beat the boss on turn 101, I get a sense of accomplishment for 5 seconds. But yet I've spent hours of being frustrated for that 5 seconds. What's the point?

I get home from work at 7:30, walk the dog, get something to eat. By time I get caught up with all that, it's like 9 PM and I gotta wake up at 5 am.  I've been having fun watching an LP of Resident Evil 1 for the same reason. I don't have the patience for managing ink rolls & saves or for "oops you did this puzzle wrong, the room floods with gas and you die and need to repeat the past few rooms to get here." 

But the game itself is **really** cool and watching someone play it who knows (and points out) every little secret and detail is fun. It's like a tour of a haunted mansion. My wife doesn't like video games, but loved watching me play games like shadow of the colossus and assassin's creed. They're just very visually stimulating and fun.  While there are some notable exceptions, FF games are usually very casual by RPG standards.  You can mash the attack button and make it through most dungeons without having to grind experience levels.  Also there are usually movie versions of the games you can buy or download which are just all the cutscenes spliced together.  Having said that, there are lots of games I find much more enjoyable to watch someone else play rather than play myself.   You gotta surpass the mountain. For in, in relevance to the OP, I like very difficult games with good story. It makes me feel a little better when I reach a great cutscene after a hard fight. It feels well earned.  Let me guess the part, is it when you're with Kiera and you're going through the cave? You should really play Saints Row 3 and 4, if you haven't already.  They are the epitome of "I just want to blow stuff up and have fun". It you haven't played the Just Cause games, they might be up your alley. GTAV still has cheat codes as well.  http://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/Cheats_and_Secrets Recently started a new character in Skyrim where I'm using console commands for the first time because i wanted to just spam spells relentlessly (lots of mod ones i hadn't had a chance to try) and it's as fun as anticipated. How are trainers risky? I use them all the time and I've never had an issue. I use Infinity for any of the games it supports and then LinGon will usually have any other I may need. Never run across any malware or viruses or anything. And as long as you stick with single player you shouldn't get banned from anything.  The easiest settings mode in that game is great. Take 1/4 damage and your troops take half damage. Keep the army sizes to 75+ and slice through enemies like butter I might have to do that, I've been struggling to get into the game because of the (brilliant but unforgiving) gameplay. try r/outside  I really enjoyed Dark Souls...

And then blight town.. \* *shudders* \* No...No... NOT AGAIN.. As a middle-aged gamer, I can't stress enough how much being busy and having a career changes your taste in entertainment.  Especially if you have a job in IT.  

When I was younger I lived for big, complex RPGs and competitive first-person shooters.  I loved the *TotalWar* series.  I loved just being engrossed in all the minutiae.

These days I much prefer simple games like Rocket League, that I can play for tiny chunks, have fun and then go do something else.  With very little in the way of investment time or energy-wise.

I even enjoyed *No Man's Sky*, specifically because it was largely aimless and undirected.  I walked/flew around looking at cool Sci-Fi fractal landscapes.  No 'boss' character hanging over me telling me to do shit all the time.

 Just finally got the game on Android and started playing. Seems cute enough. But ugh, that sounds like a not fun way to play.  Aw hell no. Vanguard was the funniest class in a shooter game i have ever played. Worked well on insane as well.

Just charge people and throw them off cliffs. All. Day. That and the one ability (not slam) that makes them float, then FIUPS them off in the direction you aimed. 

Go i had so much fun. Beat them all on Insane mode, if anything it made the story feel better to me.  I had to work my ass off in so many situations to barely survive and win which is realistically how Shephard's escapades would go and not just running around killing everyone with my three man squad. Yeah, it's weird.  Seems like u/TitaniumDragon was only using Dark Souls as a word association joke based on the fact that I said not every game need "soul crushing" difficulty.  Dark Souls didn't even really occur to me as I wrote my initial comment.

That said, games being *too easy* can also make me rage.  I couldn't get more then 25% through Kirby's Epic Yarn because the inability to die/game over state made me feel like the game was pointless. "feeling like a goddamn superhero" is exactly why I love blowing shit up in Borderlands 2 with my brother while playing as Salvador. We can just run around and shoot stuff for an hour or two and there's enough of a challenge that we are kept interested, but not so much that we're stuck on round 4 of "okay, at this time do this and then do that right away". Frankly, I suck at shooters. My reaction time and hand-eye coordination are pretty bad, and I've just never mastered the thing.

I don't usually play easy (sheer stubbornness), but I'm consistently challenged by normal or perhaps hard if there are modes above that. I just don't need Fallout cranked up to Very Hard to have a good time, it mostly just gets me killed before I can react.  Dark Souls was an exception for me, and even there I played with a 100% block shield and overleveled my character to get through - riposte play is too damn hard for me. Thank you for including them all as one image so I can view it on mobile. You the real mvp. I wish more games would tell you exactly what each difficulty does like this. Really cool. Suddenly I want to master the Wang. My biggest problem with Civ games is that the way I end up playing them, none of the difficulty modes really work right. I more or less do a sort of... slingshot operation with my civs, I guess is the best way to put it. Which basically results in my military being pretty weak early game (when it is nearly impossible to conquer cities successfully with crappy normal troops anyway) and then my economy booms and I end up being God.

The problem is that once you get ahead in Civ it becomes really hard for the other civs to ever catch up or really challenge you. So for me, the real "challenge" of the game is basically getting to that point... after which point it is a couple hundred turns of going through the motions before I win. Never got into mods for the game (never been a big modding person) but Im definitely going to have to check that out.  

Sounds interesting enough that I want to give that a try.   Because of that one trade route that started exacting enough influence to screw up your otherwise perfect religious hegemony. And then you have to spend like 50 turns producing missionaries to repropagate your message across your entire domain. Then you realize that it's because you took over the city that was a religious center, and you have to work on eradicating differing points of view, because you just want the symmetry of being all one philosophy (even though you don't even care what that philosophy is), so you try to just nuke the damn city into oblivion instead. Nope, that never happened to me.  >first nuke dropped on Jerusalem (for no goddamn reason at all, that i care to mention)

[Calm down, Mel](http://img3.rnkr-static.com/user_node_img/50004/1000071295/C350/the-jews-are-responsible-for-all-the-wars-in-the-world-quotations-photo-u3.jpg) I love rewriting history in Civ.  For some reason, anachronism is my favorite part - either I'll try and have tanks rolling around during the Roman era, or sometimes I'll viciously suppress science (refuse Research Agreements, take productive cities) and see how late I can keep people from discovering basic inventions. When Guitar Hero was starting out, I played easy mostly just to hear awesome songs. After some practice I was able to go to Medium and there I sat for the rest of the time I played. 4 buttons was more than enough for me, as I really didn't have the dexterity to use the Orange key too well.  Regarding your second paragraph, that is why I advocate using difficulty to balance the game, not deciding that "I only play games on Hard"

 It didn't help that the devs got too good at their own game. "Easy" was easy for them. Thought the same thing until i got sliced by a chieftan with a sword Yeah I played when I was just a youngin and sucked but I remember dying a lot lol, looking back it might've just been me being a dumb ass and getting killed by my own grenades. I respect that. Sometimes I just don't want to feel like a disappointment to my father so I take it easy virtually.  Counter strike has always seemed weird to me... Like everyone that plays right now has always played. Everyone knows what to do and I just kinda buy guns that seem fun and die while everyone else is a god that can headshot me with a pistol across the map. I played a good bit and got ok at it but after 80+ hours I am still almost always negative True that.  There was a time I could allow myself to be frustrated at a video-game. That was a long time ago. 
Probably why I don't play multiplayer games much.  That's why I still play Assassins Creed 3. I have Black Flag but AC3 is just constant fluent engagement and its easy as hell but still fun. Good story too. It's like when I think I'll get back into Counter Strike, but the kids destroying me weren't even conceived for the first 3 years I was playing it. And then they see my "5 year" icon on my profile and accuse me of stealing someone's account because I suck so bad. Try 15 years experience.... I'm 23, and it's true, i can't understand how i played so many matches before, i just get bored and can't handle it anymore. That perfectly describes Witcher 3's last boss. The guy has the most predictable attack pattern in the world and way too much health. It was like 10+ minutes of dodging the same tired attacks until you finally chip him down. TIL other countries call pacifiers "dummys" and I wished I lived there instead. Well it's a shoutout to the original and was always kinda hilarious Pacifier is so militaristic. THIS TOOL WILL PACIFY YOUR CRYING BABY. IF IT FAILS TO PACIFY YOUR BABY, THEN YOU HAVE A DUMMY. A dummy, *and* a pink bonnet on his head, right? It more common to call them "binkies" here. You may go years without ever hearing the word "pacifier". From western United States (Utah). Plus a pink bonnet and total bitch expression on Blazko's face.  it wants to make sure you know you're a giant pussy. Is this for real? I can't find video of this  Duke Nukem was "peice of cake" Wasnt the easier on Doom "I'm too young to die" Even the new Doom does it to an extent. Easy is called "I'm too young to die!" and is only really for people who have no shooter experience. Which is ironic, considering the experience is really kind of reversed. You're an unstoppable death god on Can I Play, and you are going to *weep* on I Am Death Incarnate. lol. veteran is getting sniped out of a jet at mach 1 FPSs will always have either moron bots or literal aimbots. It just doesn't make much sense to code several different tactics for your ai when they all have the same information and abilities. Pretty much all you can do is vary their accuracy, plus maybe stand around deliberately wasting time for a moment here and there for easy mode. Well F.E.A.R. had great AI and it was from 2005. You gotta give them some randomness. If you know when an enemy is gonna surprise flank, is it really a surprise? You up the damage taken and given, and you make the AI less predictable.

Easy means you take low damage, enemy takes high, enemies are predictable.

Medium means you and the enemies take medium damage, enemies now use weapons like grenades, rocket launchers. Enemies now use cover more intelligently, aim their shots faster/more accurately.

Hard means you take high damage, enemies take high damage, and enemies now use every variety of weapon. Mines, snipers, molotovs, fat man, etc. In combat they will heal each other, flank you, and try to flush you out of cover with explosives. 

That's a pretty quick way to distinguish the difficulties and make them scale well. Ideally they could implement advanced options for fine tuning each of those aspects (damage, tactics, AI, etc) independently of each other. I think Spec Ops : The Line had 4 difficulties. Easy, Medium, Hard, and Realism. Realism being, 1-2 shots to kill and 1-2 shots to die. That was perfect for me and exactly what I was looking for. I actually spent a LOT of time messing with mods to figure this out. I ended up extremely satisfied by increasing the damage on both sides to immersive levels such that an arrow would one shot human enemies, drastically decreasing shout wait times (thus increasing my own power and survivability), tweaking some magic spells like armor spells, turning on 100% kill moves for everything (I'm addicted to them), and drastically increasing the number of enemy NPCs. In essence it made making the wrong decisions much more costly since you can be one shorted in many cases (not always) but making smart decisions much more rewarding and you feel more of a badass since you are mowing a lot of ppl down with kill moves but always on the edge of your seat since you could die. Or in other words the drastic decrease in vitality was offset with a drastic increase in power. I love how every time Bethesda and their faults come up, people are like "Well, whats the answer!? More work? Wtf is that, it isn't fair!"

They could start by fixing their engine, AI, animations, environments, etc. Pretty much try to make a better game in every way but that's not their style. Add more AI, make both sides do far more damage, such to penalize you for your mistakes severely, but at the same time still making you feel powerful as you lay waste to your enemies. You gain power, but the scope for error decreases. Actually, Bethesda answered my woes for Fallout4 at least, with the new Survival difficulty, which not only tweaked numbers in a decent fashion, but changed gameplay and added some extra systems to make the game more challenging. I hope they continue this idea with future open-world game releases. >Just curious, how would you prefer to make a Bethesda style game more difficult? I'd imagine making the AI smarter to a significant degree would be extremely difficult to do.

They could always just add new attacks. A stunning ground smash for giants, for example. Fucking love the addition in the original, CE.  Because who doesn't want to see an Elite cop a feel on a human? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought there wasn't legendary ending for halo 2? Destiny is full of this stuff.

Like, The Last Word has the flavor text "Yours, not mine"

Or Fatebringer: "Delivering the inevitable, one pull at a time." That was a hard damn game mode. Oddly, the first few levels were some of toughest - once things moved into fancy weapons and open maps I could cope, but CQC with nothing but a battle rifle was rough.

And the last level with infinite Flood was a pain of course, but everything in between was easier. Coop is fucking impossible. If One person dies then you get sent back to the checkpoint. Me and my friend couldn't beat the first mission after hours of trying. Maybe we just blow Don't forget the Jackal snipers which can one-shot you in under a second. Well you're supposed to restart. Last I checked quick save and quick loading still worked, allowing you to just quickly reload that save before the end of the death cutscene.  Yeah, it actually seems totally reasonable.  Everybody gets the story, but one mode reflects the original balance.

And often, the other modes are pretty obviously unnatural.  Melee attacks cease to kill, ammo balances get screwed up, and 'special' weapons become unimpressive or mandatory.  I still remember the damn Jackals in Halo 2 getting headshots *without facing me*, because Legendary wasn't the designed difficulty. It's why I sometimes have a strong feeling of not wanting to play a game until I know what the 'true' mode is.

I don't want to play easy mode but I also don't want to play a shitty hard mode that just makes no sense.

 I suppose, at least in games where you actually die, that the idea is that event never happened, not in the "true" series of events. In the "true" events your hero is never defeated, not once, not unless the storyline says so. Kind of like how AC did it, by losing you are deviating from the correct storyline. Honestly I'm just kinda sick of the whole "chosen one" trope in general. Like, if I'm going to succeed, if I'm going to be special, I don't want it to be because I secretly have dragon blood in my veins or some shit. Let me, the random shmuck, succeed because I worked my fucking ass off. Let me be powerful because I made myself powerful.

The cool thing about mortals is that they are mortal. That they can slay gods and demons and all sorts or supernatural shit through sheer determination and willpower. Mortals are strong because they are weak. ESO had that with mudcrabs. Now they scaled the shit out of it and anything can still kill you, but at least you can give it hell before it does.  Oh those Diablo I days. 

"How did you get on the roof?"

And that was only the tip of the iceberg.  Ah, the Godly Plate of the Whale and Kings Sword of Haste days. I'm so glad I was there when original Diablo/Hellfire dropped. > And in Diablo 1... there was so much hacking, even other players hacking my items without me wanting them to that I was unintentionally a god there as well.

Forgot about that rofl. Stay a while and listen...
 always in games where you excel everything but the one tiny bit is just a part where you say "bullshit" to yourself. That last sentence sums up 80% of the single player games I've beaten.  Hard is too easy, Insane/Nightmare/Legendary is fucking a impossible challenge that requires perfect character builds and dozens of frustrating deaths.

Even FPS games like Halo 3 have this issue.  Heroic difficulty means I might die once a level, but Legendary?  Every jackal has a beam rifle that will 1 shot you, there aren't enough bullets in the galaxy to kill a hunter, and you can't even abuse vehicles because the grunts will plasma pistol your ass before you can even aim at them. The difference between 100cc and 150cc on mario kart.  Honestly all of the sneaking sections aren't fun. They never were.  I think about this a lot when I see new players picking up a controller or joystick or mouse - I don't remember a time when I couldn't use those things with a measurable degree of skill.

Maybe it's because I've had a controller in my hand since I was 3, but I've never had the issue of, "wait, how do I control this game?" I think the closest I came was Superman 64 when it first came out, the Internet wasn't really big, and I didn't know that it was just the game that was shit, not me. It's so foreign to me, I can't even actually imagine what it's like, to not just pick up a new game and *understand* all the mechanics presented within a minute. Someone should compile an introductory series of games for people who are new to gaming, that build up mechanics and controls without assuming any prior knowledge or skill. I got my father to try playing Portal. I figured it was ideal since it's short, easy, and the whole game is basically a tutorial. Turns out using a keyboard and mouse to move and look around is harder than I realized. Which is why it astounds me when games, big and small, don't make absolutely damn sure that their controls are perfect, rather than good enough.  I agree completely. 

Sometime though higher difficulty does add a lot to the game play. I'll reference Dagon age again where on normal it was someone hard on the first few dragons or bosses but by the half way mark I had the best gear and knew what stats I needed and some I didn't need at all. But when you increase to hard all of a sudden you need to know what types of damage enemies do, what damage counters them, what skills combo with your team, and you need to control your team to profit those combos. I don't play hard because then you NEED to do those things or you lose, but on normal you have the option but there is no incentive. So it adds something that adds depth for those who want it. But I just don't like spending that extra time and effort for the same outcome.  It's fun watching the Game Grumps play a game that Arin is good at. I get frustrated watching people miss things. I hate playing horror games, but I love watching LPs of horror games.  
I don't find it fun to jump at everything, but I do find it hilarious to watch *others* jump at everything.

...  
...Am I the baddie? I do like video games, but there are some that I enjoy watching my husband play even more than I'd enjoy playing them by myself. Those ones are usually the parkour/adventure-type games like Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, and Tomb Raider. We make a good team because I tend to see loot glittering that he misses because he's focusing on acrobatics. For some reason i have never been able to play a FF for more than a few minutes. I find them incredibly dull and generic (which is ironic, given that they are the inspiration of a lot of other rpgs) Nah, some games are just perfect to watch Let's Plays of, especially if the host has a pleasant personality. Saints 3 was a bit better for just blowing random shit up, imo.  Saints 4 was more like "there is finally a decent game set in The Matrix, but without all the pseudo-messianic nonsense." And they have cheat codes on top of that, lol JC3 is super mindless fun. Gets pretty repetitive, though.  But it disables saving your progress. I went in the back way on my first two characters because I had taken the Key and didn't know I was breaking the natural progression.  Get down there, go as far forward as I can and say "What  the fuck is with this tree? Where do I go!?"

Learning that I needed to now backtrack all the way but through the mud level made me want to strangle my own brain. Playing through it for the first time now. Using a guide only when I have to and just got to Blighttown. Is it that bad? Kill the moonlight butterfly (and hydra I believe) before going to that area the gear you get from around their makes it a bit easier, Sen's on the other hand is just torcher.  This is the same reason I play sports games. FIFA, NHL and the like.  There is progression but not a time sink in order to achieve it.  I've been in IT for over a decade. Still love RPGS and shooters.

Why would working in IT make me change taste in games? Lift is the ability you're thinking of in the first game. I think it was replaced with pull in ME2. The combat in the first game was super clumsy though. When I put the second disc in after finishing the first I was so relieved at how much better things worked, even though when I played ME2 cold I didn't really appreciate the combat.  Vanguard was the only way I got through insanity on ME3. Grenades one shotting made cover meaningless, since I'd get one shot whenever I poked my head out anyway. So I took the shield restore perk on Charge, took a shotgun and pistol for -200% cooldown, and dashed in. Got me killed a lot, but the fuckton of shields kept me alive for the most part. Better than any other class, at the minimum.  Is that the class with the "superman flying charge"?  If so, I agree.....i never got tired of doing that to everyone Bastion Sentinels with the Assault Rifle bonus talent was totally the best class in Mass Effect 1. Dark Souls isn't even that difficult really. Like it's challenging at first but as long as you're fairly adaptable you'll beat it pretty quickly.

The first one is really just a strategy of "stay right on the boss's ass and to the right, when they're in animation roll, and post attack you get in as many hits as you can. Rinse and repeat" for the strong majority. The only ones that are complained about are the ones that isn't as viable with (Taurus demon can throw you off sometimes, Hellkite Wyvern is some buuuuuuuullllshiiiiit, Capra squishes you in a tight space with those doggos, S&O can tag team you, same for Four Kings who also have specific attacks that really fuck you if you're too close), but that's where being adaptable and/or going Sunlight Bro and spamming lightning comes in. Sometimes the difficulty changes are much too intricate to really communicate those to you, though. Like what if the changes are just using different AI that has been benchmarked against play-testers?  the way of the Wang is a long and hard road to go down. You must first master your joystick, the way a fisherman masters bait. So say Attila shows up at your door early with battering rams, do you just restart? Also Deity is almost impossible to get ahead unless you find yourself on a secluded island with abundant resources and some city states for neighbors. Otherwise if you're low on troops enemies will steamroll you and they build wonders like regular buildings.

However I definitely agree that if you are ahead in science, the game becomes pretty on any difficulty.  That's pretty standard, and is an issue that all 4x games share. You're either behind the AI, or leagues ahead. The amount of time you spend on an even battleground with the AI is negligible. 

The only "fix" to this is AIs that "cheat" by being given massive bonuses. But even then, that just means that it takes until later in the game for the player to exponentially surpass them. This is the same way I play Civ5. I play defensive/production/growth based in the early game with Tradition, go big into Commerce and Patronage in the mid-game, stack gold generating wonders, and then basically play the late game like Elon Musk, and buy my way into space. Im not the only one! Thats hilarious! I love re-writing history in this game. That's exactly how I rolled, until I met another dude who played on hard. When we would vs each other he'd win every time because he had more notes so I had to crank it up. Then he went to expert so I eventually had to follow. That's why I said when I think they're ready I start pushing. But this path also requires one person to be better than the other, for solo play its p irrelevant. The only song I was ever able to beat on Expert was 'When You Were Young' in Guitar Hero 3.

I can still do it, but holy SHIT that game murders my wrists. His flesh is *seared* just the way I like it. It's going to take a lot more than 80 hours to improve in a game like CSGO.  Just keep at it, learn the smokes and strategies, and practice your aim.  You'll start seeing improvements in no time.

Also, shameless plug for r/csgocritic if you need it. Maybe i was too overgeared but it took like 2 min for me Come to the UK mate.

I didn't get the title of "The pacifier" until I was 13. According to Wikipedia they are called soothers in Canada, and teether in the Phillippines. Just one of those things that each country likes to name themselves. I dunno man, I always liked the word "pacifier". It sounds like the name of Judge Dredd's gun or something.

In italy it's called "ciuccio" (which, funnily enough, translates as "I suck". Im not kidding)

Edit: typo dummy literally means "dummy tit" i.e. fake breast .... I called it a "binkie/binky"  "Schnuller"  
- Germany I pictured a crash dummy and didn't get it. I called them "boppies" forever because that's what my mom called them... I didn't know they were called pacifiers until my 20s. Luckily I learned that before having to use the word myself outside my family. I was so confused until your post swept in and saved the day. I always heard it called a soother in Canada Utah is weird as fuck tho.  No, that's just Utah. Everywhere else calls them pacifiers. I'm in Utah as well. No way. Pacifier is how we say it in Oregon. I've heard binkie but it's more of a funny baby word.  So it's an educational game? It doesn't literally call you a giant pussy, but it does mock you in the dialog to confirm quiting.

ex (paraphrased):

>* Do you really want to quit?
>* 'Esc' to save the world
>* 'Enter' to cower in fear Well after an exhausting day of work I would probably like a piece of cake too, so, yeah that one's fine.  Yeah but the icon was of the Doom guy in a baby bonnet, IIRC. Is that not how veteran snipers from your country work? I couldn't help but think of [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nO8oPH__Ww) from MGSV when I read your comment. XD Crysis had AI that flanked, threw grenades etc. They telegraphed all of this... but in the hardest difficulty, they were shouting it in Korean, rather than in English. A small touch (and the game was still too easy IMHO), but a nice one nonetheless. Actually, if memory serves correctly, aren't F.E.A.R.'s AI movements mostly scripted and the levels are just built so that you are placed in situations where the AI can look smart?

Regardless, Bethesda's games are mostly open world and as such would probably be much harder to make "smart" than a linear shooter like F.E.A.R. Yeah except making an ai predictable or not isn't easy Fun fact, the less predictable the AI the harder it is to program and more likely it is to be completely broken.

Because technically AI has to be predictable.  You also have to keep in mind that the engine used in Fallout and Elder Scrolls games is older than some of the people playing them. > They could start by fixing their engine, AI, animations, environments, etc. Pretty much try to make a better game in every way but that's not their style.

This may or may not be true... But it really isn't relevant to difficulty level. I understand your irritation though. I like how every time someone wants to criticize something about a Bethesda game they parrot the same old engine circlejerk as if it's relevant to the discussion in any way, despite other developers/games making the exact same design decision.

Witcher 3 does the same thing (All the different difficulties do is increase enemy health and damage while reducing player XP gains). The game in the OP does the same thing. Dark Souls' New Game Plus does the same thing. Every Diablo clone out there does the same thing if they have difficulty options. Countless games by developers all over the world do the same thing. But apparently the only reason Bthesda does it is because "their, engine, AI, animations (lol?), environments, ect," are somehow broken in the context of adding difficulty to the game. Bethesda games makes incredible worlds and then modders shape it into a masterpiece.  I agree.I really enjoy "hardcore" or "realism" modes where anyone, player or npc, dies to one or two attacks. I hate when it's one sided and the player dies to one or two but the enemies are unstoppable juggernauts.  This one sends you through the ground and out of the world, as opposed to their regular attacks there nothing better than the original legendary split screen co-op. That is how I  first beat the game at a friends house with tireless all night hours, had to call a sleepover to finish it lmao This is it baby. 

Hold me. There is. I recall it was Cortana talking to Gravemind back on the covenant ship. paging /u/destiny_flavor_text  The flavour text on Last Word is what made me want to start using hand cannons. *sigh*

I wish the game itself was as fucking awesome as the lore for it is.  One of the Prince of Persia games (can't remember which one) has a voiceover that goes "no no no, that's not what happened" after you die, as though the storyteller is trying to remember the correct series of events. Good times. I wonder how many people playing D3 aren't aware that Obsidian Ring of the Zodiac is a reference to that era? Fume knight in Dark Souls 2 was that boss for me. Stopped playing and never went back after using all of my human effigies. [deleted] It's tough for game dev to find the right difficulty level for thousands of gamers in 3-5 difficulty level. It's probably because you played when you were so young that you didn't realize you were god awful at the game.  I remember games used to take me AGES to beat, but I never remember having any real difficulty with them.  Now I can beat a lot of older games I used to play in a few hours.  So, either I was just fucking around doing whatever when I was a kid, or, more likely, I just really sucked but I was having so much fun that I didn't notice. Just play a flight sim it'll give you that feeling!  Likewise. Older cousin got me into games when I was 4. I'm sure I was terrible at video at a young age, but I probably adapted to basic controls to most games a few years laters. Don't remember a time where I really struggled with coordination because I started so young. I remember by mom trying to play Timesplitters years ago and maneuvering the character and the camera at the same time was just too difficult for her. Yet, it's hard for me to grasp games as difficult in terms of basic mechanics. I think these easy modes that cater to that type of audience is really cool and I would like to see how a typical non-gamer try a game that most of us would consider a "hardcore" game.  A lot of people don't think about being new. However, I am not particularly good at video games myself even with experience, so I play a good amount of "casual" games on the side. 

I want to make this list now. I could tier it out and even sort by genre and platform. Include some info about plot, length, graphics, and gameplay in without any terminology. 

I think I will.  This is one reason why Portal (or at least Portal 2) are so good. Most of those games are tutorials, but many of those tutorials at the same time put a twist on earlier mechanics. They start with the very basics of how to move around and jump, making them very easy to get into, and they don't require timing in most of their challenges. Timed challenges can be incredibly difficult if you're not familiar with video games. I played Dragon Age on normal just because I liked the story, but didn't like having to pause the game every 3 seconds to command my buddies. I can't make fun of him anymore. :( I was playing Splatoon and an "Arin Grump" destroyed me http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny 100% agree.  If the game revolves around gameplay (Darksouls), then difficulty and mechanics are the key.

If the game is about a narritive (Dragon Age), then don't waste my time with hours and hours of Deep Roads. going to top you and say Saint's Row 2 was the best for blowing stuff up. Can do a lot more crazy stuff in that game And God mode only lasts 5 minutes, which is pretty annoying. PC for life.  I did the same thing. Except I spent all of my time and perserverance fighting my way all the way to the top, at low level. Made it to the bonfire, then made it to the gates; to be told they don't open from this side. 

Confusion, outrage and confusion  It's fine to keep going through blighttown at the start. It doesn't matter which order you do the starting objectives in. I once started with the Master Key, went down to Blight Town through New Londo, made my way **UP**, only to realize that the gate was locked and needed the key from Gaping Dragon. Making my way down then back up made me feel like Old Spice guy. Is it bad when someone used a guide to figure out the Water temple? Hell no. I spent **weeks** in blight town, nobody should subject themselves to that much mental abuse. 

My message to you: http://i.imgur.com/rfABIg8.gif

credit to: /u/BigMurph26 for this masterpiece.  I prefer the combat in the first game over the second. In ME2 on the hardest setting you were literally spamming the same ability over and over until the enemies barrier was gone just to switch to another ability to get rid of the shield. Stuff like pull didn't work until the barrier and shield were gone at which point you already killed them anyways. At least that's how I remember it. *Infiltrator laughing in the shadows* "Smart" "Smarter" "Smartest" AI? For some it is a rather short road. But it's not about the distance you travel, but the way you travel the path.  > So say Attila shows up at your door early with battering rams, do you just restart?

Nope. I selectively destroy any siege tools they have first with what I have.

I don't have no army at all, I just have a sharply limited one. And as it turns out, when you ramp up your city populations super quickly, that creates a sort of innate defense.

I dunno, it has always worked okay for me. By the time people start building catapults en masse you need to have built up enough of a lead that you can actually toss out some troops and dissuade them from attacking - or at the very least, take out their siege tools.

What I usually end up doing is basically build up my army *just* as one of my neighbors decides to make war on me, and then take out their army with my army (which spawns a few turns after the war starts) and then go and take 1-3 of their cities and get them to make peace with me.

I suspect it is kind of dicey timing, as I have this happen to me almost every game, but it works out.

That said, I don't think I've ever actually fought against Attila in the early game; I've been in games with him, but he's always been far away from me so that by the time we met, I actually had a real army. It is entirely possible that I would have a very bad time if Attila was my neighbor.

> Also Deity is almost impossible to get ahead unless you find yourself on a secluded island with abundant resources and some city states for neighbors. 

Deity is quite hard, yes. I don't typically play on Deity mode; I generally play on the third highest difficulty mode, whatever that's called. I played Diety once and lasted about 25 turns until the world had declared war on me IIRC p irrelevant...pirrelevant....peerrelevant

Playing solo is peerrelevant. I don't expect to be good, I just expect to be matched with people at my skill level, which has have never seemed to happen. Not English, but they called it "Der Babynator" here in Germany.

EDIT: A comment about a vin diesel movie of arguable quality blew up. Nice :) as someone who lives in california and is mildly dyslexic I thought it was "the pacificer" and was about surfing  I was going to be up in arms over the language difference but your statement pacified me.

Bravo Gandalf. I'm 20 years old and I just learned what a dummy is in the non American sense  Some parts of Canada.. we still call it a pacifier here From Boston and my family always called them "binkies" and our bottles "buh-buhs."

Probably because it was easier for toddlers to tell the difference, though. Is that pronounced "Kyu-cho?" This gets wonderfuler and wonderfuler... Binkies used in MA as well I grew up in New Hampshire and we called it a binky California checking in. Binkies almost always yeah binkie is what you call it when you're actually talking to a baby, pacifier almost always with adults. meirl this is somehow better. I was just picturing the game audio saying "pussy" as you hit the quit button. I'm here to blitz through hordes of AI enemies who can't aim, and eat cake. And I'm all out of cake.  Piece of Cake isn't that easy if you spawn into later levels first. If that's how it works where you are, I hope to god you're in a NATO country I'm Korean and my English wasn't as good back then so Hard was the easiest setting for me.

Kind of overstatement there, but I did have to play hard just to see what the Korean was like, while I would have preferred to just play at an easy setting. Considering they can't make a talking dog follow a goddamn cobblestone path? 

Fuck you Barbas. You go to hell, you go to hell and you die. Well we're not asking them to do anything crazy. Healing each other, flanking, and flushing cover have all been done many times different game's AI. Yeah, except this is Bethesda we're talking about. The fact that it isn't easy is a piss poor excuse when you're one of the world's top tier game development studios. Fun fact, the AI I'm talking about has been widely used in various video games for at least a decade. 

AI has to be predictable in the same way a surprise party has to be predictable. It involves planning, setup, routines, etc. yet none of that should be seen by the player. All the player should see is the final result, which is an AI which appears to have complex tactics and variability. If they fixed AI, animations, and the environments it could do wonders to enemy tactics and increase difficulty, as instead of running at you blindly, enemies could use strategic locations to their advantage past staying on top of a ledge. Also, increasing damage on both sides makes the game a lot funner than making player DT lower and enemy DT higher.  To be fair Witcher's combat imo is the weakest aspect of the game. Enemies are extremely predictable and you can kill pretty much anything by dodging in circles and using the fire sign.  Giants: they could already send you to Secunda and Masser, and now they can slam you from the surface of Nirn right into the depths of Red Mountain, where the Heart of Lorkhan originally dwelt. Visit all 3 to get to know the being behind the creation of Mundus!

Edit: I missed a word 4 box LAN parties.  Those were awesome days. Now, halo 5 removed split screen altogether. That's actually the standard ending. Halo 2 and Reach are the only games without an extra or alternate scene in the legendary ending. It was in there, but was it the Legendary ending? I swear it was just a part of the game regardless, post/mid-credits or something. When was the last time you played it? The first Sands of Time game, which I loved! 
Also enjoyed Warrior Within for the combat (and I could look past the "2edgy4u" vibe it had) and the third one, Two Thrones I think? 

I pretend The Forgotten Sands never existed though.  I remember hearing a ring drop in Hell but I couldn't find it anywhere. I searched for like 30 minutes and finally found the few pixels and it was an Obsidian Ring of the Zodiac. I think a +19 or something? One off from perfect. Idk that sucked and was also awesome.  I feel you, I eventually went naked + longsword since allies and weight just made it harder. Such a punishing fight if you get hit once I quit Skyward Sword after the first boss - I think - because of this.  
Fuck your game telling me to swing a certain way when I clearly am doing that already. I know what horizontal is I'm not some degenerate. honestly i think it's more that the way most games implement difficulty levels is in a very superficial/artificial way. like. normal is 100% health and 100% damage, and hard is 130% health, 130% damage dealt. It doesn't require more skill in anything other than patience to grind out more attacks while dodging/reducing damage better. Ideally harder difficulties would have smarter ai that utilize teamwork or tactics in a more effective way, requiring the player to critically think and develop strategies for encounters rather than mechanically press buttons better. We had *a guy* for that level in blackwater city (before you get the o2 mask) in the original Ratchet and Clank for PS2. You are absolutely right. I was even shit at Pilotwings 64, now that I remember. My first 5 or 6 hours of Elite Dangerous were damn awful. He impressed me with his Ds3 and bloodborne run, but sometimes he gets stuck for so long on things that weren't even meant to be puzzles because he just won't read.  My fiancée is victim to this sometimes! When I first had her watch Mission Impossible with me, she complained that she didn't like their "generic spy movie music". I was like, "No, this is *Mission Impossible* music. Generic spy movies ripped *them* off." Oh wow. And I thought my friend that got to the gold wall in tomb of the giants before ringing the first bell had it rough.  Here's the thing. You didn't notice he got to the Tree which means he got to the Great Hollow which means he didn't have the ability to teleport between bonfires and he probably reached Ash Lake.

That means he'd have to now go back up the Great Hollow and through Blight Town to progress.

That's not fun for a first time player who didn't know better. Not to mention guns in the first game are the best... Spend wisely and do all content and you end up with guns that fire forever with 100% accuracy and never overheat.  > Deity is quite hard, yes. I don't typically play on Deity mode; I generally play on the third highest difficulty mode, whatever that's called.

Emperor! That ones my favorite too :) That's my strategy too. I have basically 0 troops, except the odd 1 or 2 to take out barbarians. This also gives me a ton of gold. Which means when someone attacks me, I go from weakling to literal war machine within a few turns. Playing as Washington, it really felt like Rome was "poking a sleeping dragon." Fuck you Caesar and Pocatello.  That makes it sound like a cyborg has been sent back from the future to be a nanny. Ich bin ein Babynator For a second I thought you were saying the actual German word for pacifier was Der Babynator. Then I realized we are talking about that dumb Vin Diesel movie.  That's brilliant. Pacifist? Isn't that the thing that babies suck on? I'd watch it. Well 'Soothie' is a brand name. So I assume you wouldn't call a pacifier a Soothie unless it was an actual Soothie.

Same think with 'Nuk'.  I live in Canada and most people I know call it a dummy Binkie seems to be a common word for pacifiers where I live, though both seem to be used interchangeably. I've met a lot of people in Southern California who call it a binky too. Funny thing is, my friends and I have always referred to bongs as binkies. Imagine the confusion when I actually had kids... Was called a binkie when I was growing up. Mom is from New England so I guess it makes sense now. Haven't heard anyone else use the term tho That's a common nickname anywhere in the US (binkies) More like "chu-cho" [Kyubey?](http://i.imgur.com/qFg2dR6.jpg)  I'm totally a dog person. Barbas made me rethink that and consider cats. Ultimate skyrim -- barbas + Meeko as followers plus Lydia. Never be able to walk through doorways again!  >Well we're not asking them to do anything crazy. 

Why aren't we? Bethesda is a giant publisher & dev. They have more than enough staff and resources to develop better AI. You can't really have complex AI in the elder scrolls games, the AI has less options to work with.

If we are talking Fallout 4 with more variety in the weapons used, Bethesda already amped up how smart they are, to the point where I dare say they might have one of the best open world AI that I have ever seen in a game.

Fallout 4 AI will flank, take cover, use grenades and wait for you to expose yourself.

Skyrim AI has 2 options, if AI has range then use range, If AI has melee then run at target because you can't do anything else. warthog wars on blood gulch motherfuckers! Fucking miss those days Weak Reach allowed you to see Chief's cryo pod in the ending by rapidly tapping right on the sticks, but otherwise no extra scene. When I beat reach on Legendary, I initially felt slapped in the face when I didn't get an extra scene.  
Then it hit me.  
No matter how well I did, Reach's fate was still the same. Why should the ending change in the slightest? And thank the fucking stars for that. Halo 2 is the only Halo campaign I haven't beaten on Legendary because of the difficulty, but my OCD wouldn't permit me to shelve the game if there was an extra ending. Gotta use that zoom to find them pixels.  Was there any other way to play in DS2 other than naked?  Armor barely reduced damage taken and just slowed your stamina regen down.  As a fat roller from DS1, the first thing I did after a few minutes into DS2 was take off all my armor because I had no stamina and my armor wasn't making me invincible anymore. He broke my shield dependence.  2 handed my curved sword and got good and by the flame's blessed light the good was got.  Because most of the time difficulty built around level design is extremely tedious and must be done from ground up, which means a well thought out schedule and plan and a budget to execute it.

Thats tougher to execute these days especially with how much wider levels and shit are expected to be with 3d and shit being even more tedious to make than ever before. I honestly think it's because they're talking so much. His brain's "word circuit" is so busy processing what Dan said or what he's currently saying that the words onscreen don't click. Oh god just thinking about that... lmao I'd just restart  I interpreted his post as finding the great hollow but not realising there were invisible walls inside it and thinking it was just a tree. 

But yeah going up from ash lake is nearly unbearable. I think that was a reference to the Vin Diesel movie. Or a really slick German lady's man. Ich komme wieder I thought the movie was enjoyable though :P For the record (and everyone curious) the *actual* german word for pacifier is “Schnuller“ Haha, have just been doing the same thing! Glad you posted or I still would've been struggling! Here in Czech we call them "Dudlík" (Doodleek). It's "smoczek" in Polish.  
  
Which for some reason means "little dragon" literally.  No dude that's pedophiles.  RedvsBlue reference? You mean a pussyfest? He said "soother" not "Soothie." Soothie, the brand name, comes from the generic word soother.

People also use brand names in place of generic words for non-branded things, anyways. Things like kleenex, q-tips or tupperware are more egregious, but there's also things like popsicle, velcro, zipper, and escalator that are all technically brand names that are now pretty much the only words used for those items.


There's crazy people in the states that refer to *all* soft drinks as "coke." Pure madness.


You can google it on whatever search engine you prefer! Nah, I worked at a store that sold them and heard plenty people call them soothies. Kinda like how many call tissues "kleenex" , regardless of brand. Or q-tips, band-aids etc.  You must live in an area that has a lot of British immigration and British roots. Cuz I'm Canadian born and raised and I've only ever heard that term from Brits. Live in Canada and never head it referred to A dummy until this article. Always soother or pacifier.  Aha. Cool, thank you. My company is headquartered in Italy. :) >Fallout 5 AI hacks banks, global financial collapse caused by bethesda

Tomorrow's headlines? > Fallout 4 AI will flank, take cover, use grenades and wait for you to expose yourself.

And literally all I'm advocating is to ramp up/down those actions depending on the difficulty as well as changing damage numbers.

Harder difficulties should have more of that behavior, and make it more varied. As it is even on the hardest difficulties you can usually hunker down behind cover and gun down enemies as they come at you 1 by 1. Flanking should be near constant if you try to stay in one place for long on hard+. Then they ruined the physics by allowing vehicle damage and more realistic collision. I remember we used to ram each other head on and one vehicle would fly into the air. We used to have two guys on foot who would then skeet shoot with rocket launchers. Hours and hours wasted lol. Then they ruined the physics by allowing vehicle damage and more realistic collision. I remember we used to ram each other head on and one vehicle would fly into the air. We used to have two guys on foot who would then skeet shoot with rocket launchers. Hours and hours wasted lol. Fashion Souls give you a +5 to confidence and swagger though  Oh for sure. I have no illusions that my suggestion/comment would be  worth it to devs from a cost benefit analysis standpoint but as a gamer I like to dream. All I was trying to say (more to the point on your original comment) is that you aren't going to achieve a smooth difficulty curve using the industry standard method, and thus have a large percentage of your players preferring an intermediate difficulty between your offerings. I used to watch Game Grumps, and I wouldn't mind them getting stuck at all, especially if it's cause they're having a good discussion. However, it would really tick me off if he started blaming his lack of progress on the developer's poor game design instead of just admitting he wasn't paying attention. I know, in German it sounds like Skynet sent Vin Diesel back in time to change diapers. I think that was more of a reference to: "Ich bin ein Berliner" > "Dudlík" (Doodleek).


You should get that checked out TIL The super common English word "Doodleek" in Czech is Dudlik. In Hungary we call it "cumi" (the c is like the c in cent: cumee) No! Pedophiles are the doctors that look at your feet. *sigh*

...upvote Tucker! Yes Sure! "I like me..." And Uber. I drove for Lyft and people I picked up would call their friends saying they're in their Uber and will be there soon.

Yeah us Newfies are weird fuckers You're welcome :) Where is your company HQ located? I'm near Venice. But there is a difference between hard and smart AI.

And smart AI aren't going to be proving a challenge for a person either way, or we start going into the cheating territory for the AI

That's the AI right now in Fallout 4, and they still aren't difficult with all those tactics, I can't imagine how idiotic they will be without portions of the tactics they use taken out.

AIs are a complicated thing, it's why Bethesda does it the way they do, or why most games resort to giving players a handicap over the AI. 

A simple solution for difficult AI is to just spawn more enemies with better equipment, or bring later game enemies out sooner. But even this has many faults. My favorite moment was in a 3-man FFA in Blood Gulch:

My one buddy and I were flying at each other in banshees, firing wildly as we passed, then looping around. This continued a couple rounds until our other friend, who was up on the ridge with the sniper rifle, got a double-headshot on us. Jeep Rumble: 

Blood Gulch, 100-lap race with no markers (made it basically impossible to finish a "race").

Set all player shields and health to max, unlimited grenades, charge pistol only. Set amount of lives. 

As many jeeps as the round can hold, up to four players. 

Rules:

No killing one another with guns. Only roadkill is allowed (since even with max health shields, getting hit by a jeep is an instant kill). 

All players must be in a jeep unless knocked out. You must try to get back in your jeep ASAP. You may use either grenade to deter other drivers from running you over. You can't shoot any other players, but if you respawn and are running to get into a jeep for the first time, use your charge pistol shot so that you glow a bright green and drivers know to avoid you. Last one alive (after all lives are lost) wins. 

Me and my college roommate would play this shit for hours. The sweaty palms of racing to your overturned jeep, flinging frenzied grenades and hoping to overturn or reroute a friend's jeep as they barrel toward you, and then barely making it only to be flung halfway across the level thanks to the vehicle physics of Halo1.... oh man, we'd laugh like loons for hours as we ran one another over, launched jeeps into oblivion, and tossed grenades like parade candy.  For real. All about that Desert Sorceress top for the single gloriously exposed nipple. It's most obvious during Game Grumps, but his attention disorder still shines in other works.  I still watch some, but yeah. If he focuses up and just plays the discussion is just "lol butts", but if he loosens up and just talks, the discussion is better (which at the end of the day is what I'm there for) but the gameplay suffers. I would watch the crap out of that movie /r/nocontext I am so proud of this comment train. Bravo Reddit, bravo.

Remursturd Wait, Ubisoft is selling a demastered version of AC2? Why? The guy is just surprised the frame rate is that smooth in an Assassin's Creed game. Does remastered mean brighter?

I feel like a lot of these "remastered" games don't really look any better, they just look different. Like the new skyrim, when I see graphical comparisons it doesn't really look much better, certainly not enough that I would want to buy the game again   I know they have good intentions (make money). But I feel bad for the original creators. They put out something that, while it may had it's flaws, they thought was a good game. That's why I respect the Zelda team and the Valve team. They delay the shit out of their games, but when you get them, no Remastering needed. You can play them 15 years later and they still look amazing.  What happened to my face?? Not only did they forgot how to do lighting; not only did they make every Italian a pasty-faced white douche; not only did they fuck up the climbing animations; but they creating this unsightly abomination.

Way to fucking go, Ubisoft. This is what happens when you use a cheap and incompetent studio (Virtuos) to "remaster" your games for a quick buck. You bunch of fucking syphilis infected, puss weeping, shit stained cocks. What game is this
 This looks like it could be on a episode of Nathan for You where Nathan visits the studios of Ubisoft and tells them to add brutal designs of celebrities as extras in their games and see if anyone notices to up their recent falls.

[Looks exactly like Dennis in "The Nightman Cometh"](http://images2.fanpop.com/images/polls/147000/147324_1227976801836_full.jpg?v=1227976595) Found MrRobot Thats how I look when I'm high in public and trying to act natural, except my eyes are red. Goa'uld! When the acid kicks in... The rarest Pepe of renaissance Guy looks like Max Verstappen 

http://media.nu.nl/m/558xdo9azsn9_wd640.jpg/gaat-max-verstappen-seizoen-podium-halen.jpg Huh. I never knew Renaissance Italy had Deep Ones. They added a Mr bean skin? today on games that dont need remasters but devs need money When you remaster a game a bit too much. Always and forever, Alyssa Edwards.
 He's seen some shit. Its kinda like when that lady tried restoring that painting of Christ. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/2JLjp

Renaissance stuff doesn't seem to remaster well.  NPC clearly became self aware. Great remastering effort team! When you land in another fucking universe and you're actually aware.  re mass turd Wtf? Did they lose the file for that guy or something and just jury rigged a quick replacement? So not only did you not link source, your title is the only thing you could read from the gif itself. Do you even know what game it is? I'd like to know which developer/game director, etc. actually looked that and said "Yup, that's better." I almost see it as an improvement pepe is that you someone needs to stick the remastered painting faces on this screenshot...

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pj-eTk1ZlD8/hqdefault.jpg Just wait until you see the climbing animations, haha they are so bad. Pepe in human form  They took the Silent Hill Collection as a challenge.  So I guess Pepe's not actually a frog but rather a really, really old Italian dude. He looks like pepe the frog. Who would have known that they wanted to memefy the game.. Shortly after applying his makeup, Fabbio was struck with a sense of existential dread When you hoping no one notices you're high af I think this is the face that you see on the civilians when they're further away from you. His face may just not have loaded properly for close distance for some reason. Jesus! Who the hell screwed that guy up? He looks like Ussop. That moment the realized he was living in a simulation. Omfg
It's human Pepe This looks like a "far-away" model that somehow found its' way into the foreground. It's pretty common for games to have ugly low-quality models to use when an NPC is at a distance, for the sake of performance. As the player approaches this model is swapped to a full one.

I've actually seen this worse in another Ubisoft game, AC Unity. In that game the jankdudes sometimes failed to swap out until they were right in front of you.

Anyway, does anyone have the game? I wanted to know if the climbing was changed, I've seen conflicting reports.

UPDATE: I did some reading, and for anyone wondering this dude is a glitch and doesn't appear in every instance of the game. As for the climbing everything should be the same, but the Polygon video shows off a fast-climbing glitch that was also present in the original. Can't help but hear the "Curb you enthusiasm" music being played.  "Remastered" is just another word for blinding lights and overly vibrant recolor. ...Backrolls? rarest of all pepes Is that Rami Malek? Was this remastered by the woman who ruined that Jesus painting? So why does the remaster as a whole look like garbage? Did they gut the graphics so low so they could make it hit 4 k? It's not weird.

It's just so remastered that it has an advanced artificial intelligence and is looking around wondering why the heck the remaster is so bad, and plotting its attack against the world. Wow that is a awful job of "remastering". Internalized Oppression  This is how season 3 of Mr. Robot begins. This feels like the work of George Lucas  If Pepe were human When the blunt too strong When you're high and hope no one notices My name is Alyssa Edwards and THIS, is Alyssa's Secret...*tongue pop* Pepe the frog was inspired by this man Has Ubisoft done anything well recently? Pepe asf Lol  That's how mushrooms is. I wouldn't recommend it. Guy just remembered he left the oven on This reminds me of that church painting  that was "restored" Looks familiar...

https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2013/02/08/17/AP899346187021.jpg /r/crappyoffbrands Hi, im edwad I wonder what it would look like if they "remastered" final fantasy 7? Pac man maybe? I'll just show this to people when they wonder why I boycott Ubisoft.

'nuff said. It's like they somehow accidently deleted this guy at the last minute and just had to throw something together That's when Alex realized he wasn't in Toon Town anymore. Did anyone else hear "The Sound of Silence" when it zoomed in on his face?  "This whole enlightenment thing, it all makes sense" He looks like he just became sentient and is realizing that he's in a video game.  let's bump up the contrast and sell to the plebs again Is this for real?  End my life fam This kills me everytime. Hahaha And this isn't even Pepe's final form *Am I… am I in a simulation?* Where will you be when the LSD kicks in? I would love to see the ezio saga truly remastered with their current movement system. Looks like vitalyzdTV hahah When the remastering process grants you consciousness and you start to realize you're in a video game 😳 Reminds me of this: http://m.imgur.com/gallery/2JLjp I think he got lost on his way to Paris and ended up in Florence... Remastered, AKA brighter colors and the occasional disfigured face How does the remastered edition look even worse?!? Wtf? Who the fuck looked at this and said "Yeah, this looks far better than the original and not creepy at all." I actually thought the right was remastered until I read the bottom. What the fuck?  *Curb Your Enthusiasm theme begins to play as the man realizes how hideous they've made him in his digital prison* Weird guy notwithstanding, I kind of feel like the remaster looks worse. As someone who has never played this game I genuinely thought the one on the left was the original "Holy fuck that's some strong acid" I see literally no benefits the remastered ed. solely based off this gif.


Does this game have any redeeming qualities? Were they even trying! http://imgur.com/k4oY0OP Wtf man? When the drugs kick in.  I don't know what this game is, but that character looks [familiar](http://imgur.com/a/jik4S)... It looks like that masterful restoration of the fresco a few years ago.  No, no, no! You simply don't get it! This is"cinematic" That's the look of a man who has seen some serious shit in his life.  what happened to you man... what have you seen? [hey OP](https://gfycat.com/PeriodicGoldenAfricangoldencat)  Thank god I didn't buy this shit "REMASTER" This is a gif from a video why not just link the whole video,? I just know I've seen him [somewhere](http://i.imgur.com/NgMNRY8.gif) before... Do game directors not play their games anymore? It's The Thing... Fuckin' synths  Until I read your comment I thought right was remastered.. Bro....im being so enlightened right now... http://imgur.com/ay7zxnD Enlightening Intensifies /r/AccidentalRenaissance Have you accepted our Lord and saviour "the Renaissance" for 1 ducat?  Yikes I know they got rid of a lot of that XBox 360 fog... but it looks a lot like the art of the atmosphere of the city was stripped away when they did that.

It does look, nicer?  But as another commenter said it looks like they just brightened things up and then somehow biffed the gameplay extraordinarily hard.

But I have come to expect nothing less from Ubisoft.  Good god those climbing mechanics are terrible! Everything they changed just seems to have made it worse. Why is it that so many remastered versions end up looking so ridiculous? If I had to speculate I'd say they probably pawn these remastered titles onto developers or small teams not really capable of putting out a full working product but who are at the very least capable of piggy backing off of the previous devs work. Then since a lot of these rereleases are just cash grabs anyways they probably impose impossible deadlines to further cut spending then when the deadline hits just kick that piece of shit product out the door to sell. Very low risk for them since they're marketing almost entirely on the nostalgia of the original game.  Thank you He's white now, is no one gonna touch on that?! They made him white, they gave him the old Michael Jackson treatment.  Okay. Remastered looks like it means: turned off blur filter and increased contrast.

LOL. I was hoping the Curb Your Enthusiasm music would play as they zoomed in. Was disappointed.   There's a couple of shots in that where I actually think the environment of the city looks better in the remastered. Not all of them, just a few. Mostly at night. 

What the ever living fuck did they do to the climbing and running animations? It doesn't even look playable. 0% chance of purchase material I am so glad I didn't purchase this game. 

Ubisoft has fucked up *Assassin's Creed* so bad, that they had to release a remastered version of the best games...  Then it decided to fuck that up too.  

Okay Ubi...time to shut down *Assassin's Creed* and give *Prince Of Persia* another chance. [He's scanning insanely](https://youtu.be/U8FzGlgVGdo) I loaded up on Visine and everything to make sure they couldn't! Special Needs Edition Assussins Crud Remustard Ermahgerd rermersterd Remasderp. Want ketchup with that? To be fair it's the whole Ezio trilogy, not just AC2. Is "Because its Ubisoft" not a good enough answer? Because people want to play the games on PS4 or Xbox One. So they can make AC games with even less effort while still pretending to not be super greedy while putting the AC series 'on hold'. His head exploded in the PC version.  God, I bought an R9 290 and tested it on this game. I thought something was wrong with my new card :(. Yes.

*source: Arkham remastered* Everyone... literally everyone. I'm pretty sure even ubisoft has said this at some point *minutes

FTFY I don't think that they had this in mind

The comparison video also shows some color problems and character climbing animation issues The grandma probably led the team.  What Stephen Colbert called a "dough-faced homunculus."  What is that one called again  I thinking more of [Whistler's Mother from the Mr Bean movie](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.144935040.0964/flat,800x800,070,f.jpg).  Although it was originally an atrocity, apparently it has become somewhat of a tourist attraction now, leading the church to be positively benefitted by more donations. Didn't realise the gif was real and thought it was just making a joke based on this Yup. Ubisoft fucked up the whole game. Yes but it's not entirely as a result of the remaster. The non-important NPCs in cutscenes were chosen randomly and some of the random NPCs look retarded like this. No its a glitch that happened to a few people. It's been patched out. 

People like to jump on the Ubisoft Circle Jerk hate train whenever possible though.  its not a remaster, its a port, and a mediocre one at that. I thought the exact same... i had to look it up... i dont know what they did, but it's real... and just as terrifying It's a-me! Mario! They outsourced the game to a cheap af Chinese 3D company. This is the result. Reminds me of [this](https://i.imgur.com/0XOtxxc.png). Sugar.  Sugar. In. Wator. 

More.  More. More. "Are you seeing this too?" [deleted] Dude looks like a praying mantis  Easy there I feel like more often than not those 2 come hand in hand Ah, the Potato Jesus method! Seriously stop buying remastered editions they are just empty cash grabs.  Ubisoft strikes again! My name is Ezio Auditore Da Firenze and THIS ... Is Assassin's Creed *tongue pop*  Hah! "Fuuuuuck. I wandered into the wrong studio, bitches. Oh that one dude this Phi Phi O'Hara bitch is throwing shade at is cute though... Giving me some Rigger Morris in my Eye-talian chonies, gwurl. Oh, shit! Phi Phi done throwed a rock. These mens is going crazy! Not this face, mama! I gotsta skeedaddle back to Seattle. Time to *GO* from this Ponte Vecchio! *tongue click*" I got the Skyrim remaster for free on PC.  It definitely looks better than vanilla, but it's clear they gave it out for free since you could mod it to make it look as nice as the remaster. I thought the same about skyrim until I actually played it. It looks fantastic in game, and it's a huge improvement on the original as well as the addition of quicksaves and overall much quicker load times I'm more impressed than I thought I would be. For Skyrim, if you're on PC the remastered version is better for moding and was free to everyone who had the original. If you're on console, it allows moding for the first time, and you might not have a PS3 or Xbox 360. And when they do a remaster, goddamn do they do it right. Ocarina of Time 3DS had amazing graphics and the controls just felt so right To be fair the original assassins creed 2 is an amazing game, possibly the best in the series and the only reason a remaster could be necessary is to play it on a new console. Zelda OOT does not look amazing. Please take off your nostalgia goggles. Even having "good controls" is debatable. Is it still a great game? Of course. But let's not say it's things it isn't.  >  forgot how to do lighting

Looks like they cranked up the contrast too high (losing fine detail on most of Ezio's gear) and went for deep color saturation everywhere, while simultaneously dropping many of the clouds, smoke, and other particle effects. 

Quite the hatchet job.  whoa there bud, everything ok? > a cheap and incompetent studio (Virtuos)

Well all of their locations are in east asia (India to China), so... Ubisoft started to go down hill after AC3 . Greed runs that company. It will never change bc the teens have their parents buy this garbage.  I stopped playing after ac 3. It was so bad that I never looked back.   Assassin's Creed 2 Assassins Creed 2.

- Ezio. Ezio Auditore da Firenze. MY BRAND It looks like a dev accidentally deleted the face textures and couldn't ctrl-z and so had to paint on a new face before the boss noticed. i'm wondering how this happens, it looks like it's supposed to be a different model, is this a result of flipping textures around or something? It is real sadly. [This is from IGN's comparison, the gif starts around the 1:50 minute mark.](https://youtu.be/PwYuqQQ5K0U)

Ubisoft outsourced this to a Chinese company with a shitty track record. Assassin's greed Yes! Exactly what I came in here to find. It's his mannerisms too and his eyes as he looks around. Real innsmouth look going on there.. Grow Up

EDIT: Ffs the one time I'm too lazy to post a link... [Here you go dammit](http://store.steampowered.com/app/426790/) Rainbow 6: Siege is pretty amazing. But The Thing makes perfect copies... It's Ubisoft's The Thing (Enhanced for ps4) *Yeah, fuck you too!* DAMN SYNTHS Enlightened AF "What the duck is this? WHAT THA FUCK IS DAT?!!" By your own intelligence? First thing I've laughed out loud at in awhile. Bravo Where will you be when diarrhea strikes? That dude's eyes are so narrow he probably uses one goggle to go swimming  When you're having Thanksgiving dinner and your racist grandpa goes from telling funny stories to complaining about the Jews and the blacks ruining the country. *tips gyrocopter* Open up a shitty photo editing software. Take a slightly blurry picture and apply the "sharpen" filter. You just did what Ubisofts calls a "remaster." The remaster looks worse than the original (including the freakin' guy) Yeah, it's kind of funny how often older games ended up using their graphical limitations to actually help make a better atmosphere.  Silent Hill was a good example of this, the thick fog wasn't just there to be spooky, it was there so the game only had to render the city out a few feet. Honestly I like the look of the original better.  Ubisoft can't even update a game correctly.  Both of the remastered Halos were leagues better than this.  They nearly felt like different games.  The few good differences in the original and remastered Assassin's Creed are so negligible there is no point in purchasing the game.  Or any other Ubisoft game for that matter.  Somehow this makes all their future games shit.  Fuck Ubisoft. I never realized how murky the original was. The remaster is so much more colorful. That's the only good thing though.  To me it looks like the night time segments with the fog were better in the original, but the new day sections with actual colour are much nicer in the new one. Shame that any of it got worse! I mean some of the colors look better, it's a little bit brighter... but man, those bugs and that horrifying NPC model. Like when low res consoles went from tubes to digital. It looks more "neat", but the blur from the tubes made them look less pixelated. Does anyone else think that some of these remastered are only a cash grab?!? It's the equivalent of standard def hiding poor CGI (by more modern standards), or when TV made the jump to HD, remember how crappy news presenters looked before the make-up game caught back up? You can't just make a game sharper and expect it to look better. The older, muddier perspective hid comparatively primitive texture and model-work. The fog helps more games than you realize, here's a somewhat famous shot of GTA San Andreas with all the fog removed, http://i.imgur.com/UzIdtxj.jpg I actually like the original more...  The guy on the right looks oddly aware of his deformation in the remaster.  I think a lot of games are designed around the hardware they can use. The city, for the most part, looks a lot better in the original to me because it keeps a sense of character. In the remastered version they remove the fog and brighten things up, but the city wasn't designed to be clearer and brighter. It ends up making it look small, bland, and without character. It wasn't designed to look like that.

The character animations and models are just laziness, though. Ubisoft outsourced this and it's clear they just wanted to make a buck. The sad thing is this franchise is sort of their bread and butter, it feels strange that they'd rush the standard cash-grab but then again... it is a giant publisher hellbent on profit.

The broken animation lerps on climbing is unforgivable though.  They just boned that whole thing. I just don't see why anyone would buy it in the first place. Who is buying this? And why? Original:

> "I poured my blood, sweat, and tears into this project for two years of my life. I did my best to make it shine with what meager time I had, so that it may thrive and be accepted in spite of it's flaws. It was like the child I never had."

Remaster:

> "We can sell this game again for full price if we just up the textures and model detail! What's that? All the old staff are either gone or busy on other stuff? ... ... ... Alan, please add detail."

 Then you have Wind Waker HD which is amazing in every way. Yes! I was hoping the link was to Louis! I show friends this exact clip if they ask what being high is like. It's slightly different for everyone, but Louis gives a pretty detailed, accurate description. Giving the player that ocular pat down  "look at him, 1, 2, 3... Now switch, 1, 2, 3..."  Remedial Edition You rang? This needs to be a subreddit I have a love-hate relationship with Ubisoft AC2 is one of my favorite games and I'd love an "updated" version for new technology. But Ubisoft sucks at these updates.  Aren't they backwards compatible? [This video shows how much better the original Arkham graphics were from 'remastered'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEXmZUtzacU) "Fuck it. We don't give a shit. You'll buy it anyway."

-Ubisoft, probably. Except for Siege, fuck siege is good. Jursus Crust Ecce Mono r/MonkeyJesus  Because they're all like I can't believe she fucked up this bad. Unless I'm mistaken, they outsourced the "remastering" to a separate studio, "Virtuos", who is known for fucking up remasters. They were used, supposedly, because they're cheap. Well, you get what you pay for, don't you? Holy shit, until this comment I didn't realize the remastered version was on the left. I was chuckling to myself watching the gif loop thinking "Huh it's so funny how in memory things seem so much better."

... I guess sometimes because they were. Wooow. I uhhh guess I'm just gonna keep my PS3 copy if I get the urge to play. No no, they Ubisoft it. How? Then why are people reposting gifs and pictures only of the same character? I laughed the first time I saw it, and someone in the comments said it was just a bug. But the constant reposts and exaggerating it to say the entire remaster looks like that is pure karmawhoring. It's Ubisoft. They never fail to fuck up. How did they get the remastered version to look **worse**? That's a bit of an overstatement. The game is perfectly fine. The hate train is real. Thanks for the info. Gonna keep my cash in my pocket then. Got a whole video of scenes like this? Comparison videos on youtube seem fine to me, so maybe there's one of them fucking up the whole game? I think you can actually see the NPC from the original in the remastered side right when he points. (His hand comes in front and it's not as easy to see but the clothes are same at the very least.) Going to need more than your word on it to believe you. Why the downvotes? that hardly takes any wind out of the circejerks sails though there are enough other reasons to hate ubisoft for Yeah but he looks fucking crazy He's no Dorothy Mantooth I can't explain it but this is one of the most pure and beautiful comments I've ever seen. *I wonder if they'd notice if I nabbed this here fly and started eating it with my mandibles...God Im so hungry right now* He was minding his own business in a beta then wham - there he is a remastered AC. Trippy as shit. They can be done well, especially if it's a multiplayer game They can be nice if you never got around to playing the original. I just picked up the remastered Gears of War on pc. Loved it. But otherwise, yeah, they're not really worth it. Cod4 has been amazing so far The only time I've ever bought a remastered was the God of War collection for PS3... and that was only because I wanted to play GoW I+II without having to dig out my PS2.  

Tl;dr Remastered have a place when they serve as re-releases to bring older games up to newer platforms. Skyrim is pretty great if you never played any of the DLC like myself.  Well, I am going to buy KH 2.8 remix later in march 2017. 2 games in one including some kind of movie for 60 bucks. Then, two months later I'm going to buy 1.5+2.5 for my PS4 so I have everything on one console(yes, they are gonna sell both remasters of 4 games in one for probably 60 bucks. Still worth it) Homeworld remastered disagrees. The real advancement is one that you can't even see.  64-bit means that modders have more memory to work with, meaning you'll be able to install more mods in Skyrim before you run out of RAM and everything crashes and makes you sad. You can make the original look way better than the base remastered if you mod the original. But remastered Skyrim will have way better mods down the line.  Can't wait until SKSE updates and then all the mods tied to it. Halo 2 and Halo CE anniversary editions look fucking great. This ^. I don't buy remasters so they'll look better. I buy them so I don't have to use the old console.  It looks really flatly lit, like they turned off shadows or something. [ *muffled gross sobbing coming from a nearby haycart* ] The NPC model there is grabbed randomly. A bug causes a random low poly NPC to grabbed and that's what you get. There can be a few reasons why the model looks the way it is (most likely its supposed to be viewed at a distance, so you can't see it's ugliness) but it wasn't supposed to be pulled for this part. I watched it. As far as I can tell it's no different than a nice ENB mod. That and they totally screwed up the character faces, really looks amateur. Actually, there are a LOT of amateur skins out there that are much better than this so.... really looks like they did them all in 1 day. Do people think you're actually telling him to grow up? Its a game guys... Also Rainbow Six Seige, the Division is good now too. Not perfect copies. They cannot absorb inorganic traits. Check the original guy's medical records. I bet he has some steel plates in his head from a childhood "fencing" accident. Well it was the renaissance, maybe the 'thing' used some artistic license. "No I don't want to make a perfect copy, I will make it my own. Instead of mildly confused crash test dummy, I will have shifty looking muppet burn victim." Actually, The Thing only appears in the xbox one version of the game. The ps4 version actually looks normal....or maybe...it's the perfect copy?! More like Ditto from that episode of pokemon. Yooooo it's enliiiiiiit! Not the Enlightenment era yet man. Artistic prowess definitely enlightened though. Enlightened AF is still enlightened AF backwards enlit af And not by some phony god Omg I'm shitting my brains out right now while reading this. it's a good thing they won't be rewarded for screwing over the communit-....

*sees sales and preorders*

###GOSH DARN IT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS Did they outsource this? It seems like they outsourced it to some shitty 3rd world company, and got taken for a ride. Don't forget to speed up the player to appease the ADHD crowd but who cares about adjusting all those animations for the increased player speed?  No one will notice amiright? more like when mr. bean sneezes on whistler's mother Technically they never called it "Remastered". We the consumer just thought that's what they were going to give us. 

Their PR guys are calling it "Enhanced". I think they know because if they said Remastered they might get hit with a false advertising thing like NMS.
Source : http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-US/games/ezio-trilogy/index.aspx#acec-buynow > the game only had to render the city out a few feet.

When your game engine can't render more than a few feet of los, make a horror game The best (worst?) example of this is GTA: San Andreas

[You probably remember it as this huge immersive world, but here let's strip away all that fog...](http://i.imgur.com/UzIdtxj.jpg) [deleted] So does everyone with eyes. Halo 2 Anniversary is one of my favorite games of all time. Hell, their own Stick of Truth remaster was 20 times better than this UBI didn't do the remaster. They outsourced it to Virtuous studios. This was not done in house.  no, people are not trying to make money It's seems like almost all remasters now a days are complete cash grabs Sometimes, yes...  I mean I played Shadow of the Colossus and the Metal Gear Legacy on PS3 and those came out pretty awesome.

I also bought the remaster of Dead Rising 1 on PC and Devil may Cry 4 and was super happy with all the changes that were made graphically.   So in most of my experiences it has been pretty great.  On that note, we're  also talking about companies that aren't Ubisoft so.

And as others have stated Ubisoft did probably get some third party devs to do it and shame on them for even releasing this. Definitely. I think the same could be said about GTA: San Andreas. I recall seeing footage with draw distances/de-fogging mods that make the previously expansive-feeling map seem small. Yea, its like if you _remastered_ James Cameron's Aliens by amping the lighting up. That wouldn't make it better, it would make it look like shit.

If you can find a picture of what the xenomorph costumes look like you'll see why. They're basically painted with strong yellowish highlights to make them stand out in very dark lighting and have great depth. Well, I really wanted it. I loved the Ezio series, I was really excited for this. Not anymore though and that's kind of depressing. I don't have a PS3 anymore so I can't play what was once my favorite game. So I guess it's just a nostalgia thing. Booze - Sad when you're alone, great when you're at parties

Pot - Great when you're alone, more terrifying than a spider skeleton dungeon nightmare when you're at parties Remurdial edition  So, we finally meet... I don't think you'll ever have the chance for your username to work so perfectly for you again. r/retriedusername Right? I'd love a truly remastered AC1 too.  AC 2 is backwards compatible. The other 2 games in the Ezio Collection are not. The PS4 doesn't have backwards compatibility as far as I know Ubisoft still knew though and probably for quite a while. That's why there was no advertisement or even a big announcement around the remaster it was just pushed out. They should've went with "Bluepoint" instead. Come to think of it, Warner Bros. should've done the same with Return to Arkham. No one paid the potato Jesus lady either, so I think it's a trend cheyna They're labeled dude Oh geez, same here! Since these usually have original left and remaster right, and since the right side looked to obviously better, I thought this was a 'Ha, old graphics were so silly' kind of thread. It's not like the PS3 version is unplayable or too ugly to look at. I still play Brotherhood on PS3 and it looks just fine.  sub it out to the cheapest studio in india? BOOM profit My roommate has it. Everyone's using the same pics and cherry picking shit. It looks way better. The remaster isn't shit at all. The gif is indeed a glitch. 

But hey, these guys saw pics on the internet. They must know more than I do even though I effectively own it.  Sometimes you try to touch things up so much that you forget to look at the whole picture, and then suddenly your proportions look like they were drawn by Tim Burton. https://youtu.be/WyXeDG-XrmE?t=17m52s

https://youtu.be/fi2nP17dN8E?t=16m47s because reddit don't like their circle jerk being interrupted  Cause he's wrong. The eye thing is though the whole fucking game and they killed the lighting as well. That's why he's perfect for the role! Was she taken to a nice seafood dinner? Gears of War Gold was actually done very well The $80 COD 4?  Why the fuck can't I buy it standalone. I don't want Infinite Garbage, just cod4 remaster  Plus with mods it's a totally new game. When I buy 1.5+2.5 I'd have bought most of the franchise 3 times and some 4 times.

 I FEEL NO SHAME True!  And they let you live-switch to the original version. I swear all they had to do was fill those things with rocks and they would've found a 100% efficient method for killing the assassin that has been giving them so much trouble. Your Carpenter lore is impressive. Perfect is the wrong word, I just meant they wouldn't walk into the room looking like they saw the Holy Ghost Neat fact about those copies, it tries to be as exact as possible. 
Got a bad heart that could die on you in a day?
So does your copy.  Which is pretty bullshit to be honest. The thing is capable of mimicking people perfectly. Inorganic things like metal plates are just sort of in the body. Seeing as how the thing can transform into a monster at the drop of a hat it shouldn't be too hard to incorporate an artificial hip into its body mass. Why is fencing in quotes. Do you doubt the legitimacy of the accident? What were his parents covering up? Check their teeth for fillings. That's some spectacular vernacular you've got there, patron.  I believe you have just coined something. Hey! I believed you... :/ "But I'm not a quote maker" - Aalewis, January MMXIII  I am euphoric. But if I preorder, then I'll be sure to get it on release day with the special DLC only for pre-orders!!!  You're aware that most gamers don't hang around /r/games right? It's almost like Reddit makes up for 5% of the gamers community. Pre-orders on a remaster? With only a movie ticket bonus? For what purpose? That guy in the background is like, "Am I on acid right now, life is so clear right now..."  The first thing I thought of was this:

http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/09/20/161466361/woman-who-ruined-fresco-of-jesus-now-wants-to-be-paid I mean, they did outsource it, but Ubisoft is still to blame for signing off on this shit. Remakes don't get play tests apparently.  

>It seems like they outsourced it to some shitty 3rd world company

In fact, that's *exactly* what they did. The company that's responsible for this abomination is called Virtuos, and they're (in)famous for shitty ports and "remasters".  Enhanced from what? My old arse PC version looks better then this.  Remastered doesn't imply quality.  It just means the original master copy was updated for new mediums.  It would not warrant false advertising.  Certainly not on the level of NMS Did MMS get actually hit? Check out Morrowind, take the fog off and everything is like 20 feet away from each other 


Bethesda got around this by giving you wrong directions and putting fog everywhere so it feels massive Unless they actually revamp the whole game from the ground up, we should just call these "remasters" ports.  MWR is a ridiculously huge overhaul to the graphics, Skyrim SE adds support for 64-bit and DX11, and provides mod support for consoles as well as overhauling LOD, textures and TOD configurations, the Master Chief collection was pretty sweet, I honestly can't think of many shitty remasters that have come out in the past year.

remasters are getting BETTER, not worse, on average.

"HD remaster" used to LITERALLY just be "we patched the game to work with the console's backwards compatibility and render in 1080p". this was the case for as long as I can remember. 

now suddenly all these amazing remasters are coming out and NOW everyone's cynical about them? only after they start taking a step in the right direction?

I don't get it, man. Halo 2 remaster was fucking amazing  Speak for yourself, Skyrim Special Edition is fantastic on my Xbox One.  Depends on the game. The Uncharted series remastered is great.  That got remastered? Same here. I think Resident Evil 1 and The Last of Us were the only remasters that I've actually bought and thought it were better than the original. Jesus christ I know. It's like every single aspect of a social situation is magnified and analyzed and everything becomes awkward or bizarre. When I'm alone I just feel fuzzy and listen to music, and it's really relaxing. And I really agree with him about how weed is different, I can only take like 3 hits  of "normal" weed before I'm transported to another fucking dimension. Remierdal edition, for the spanishly gifted. Urdition Ah, I see that you survived the condiment wars. r/youtried I hadn't even heard of there being a remaster and AC2 is probably in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Had I not heard about things like this thread, I probably would have unknowingly picked it up this winter What was the actual goal of the "remastering?" Just a chance of platforms that changed how skins work so badly so they had to manually build new art for everything? They absolutely knew and they absolutely didn't care. They know the series is falling faster than a leap of faith off the Vatican and knew it would make no difference to anyone if this collection was complete shit and it wouldn't sully the brand name any more than anyone cares. Worst case scenario is they break even from sales with what they paid this other company to do, best case scenario is they make a profit off of it with no effort.  Bluepoint's MGS HD Collection is just fantastic, really excellent and thoughtful conversion of classic games. Bluepoint is the best, but i think they are working on a really big remaster right now  To be fair, WB did go back and fix most things people were complaining about. It looks a LOT better than the initial trailer showed.  normally you'd expect the remastered to be on the right side While true, it violates a pretty standard 'left to right' ordering that people expect (in languages that read left to right, of course). I saw the crazy face before I saw the labels. I was shocked when I figured out the remaster was on the left. Thanks for that! Is there more proof of it? So far I keep seeing this same comparison everywhere but nothing else 

I'll check out the assassins Creed sub when I have more time but I'm just wondering  You mean the $20 MWR w/ $60 Infinite Warfare? Well it isn't really $80, it comes with Infin... oh, I see what you mean.  True that. I completely played through the game 3 times on 360 back in the day.  So I put on some mods that are just going to make the game not as tedious, which is really enjoyable. 

Mods like, rich merchants, everything weight zero, faster leveling.  As someone who never had a ps3 or pc to game on let me just say, Skyrim is the fucking best. And BEAUTIFUL on ps4 There was an easter egg in Witcher 2 just like that. Without the rocks, though. Wasn't that "inorganic rule" from the thing prequel? 'Paint proprietors gaoled, DaVinci exclaims I had no idea....' He might be a spiritual lyrical individual Faded AF however. \*Professional quote maker >special DLC only for pre-orders!!

It's funny how at my local gamestop I can buy a game that's 2 years old and 90% of the time it'll still have the preorder codes Don't let them gyp us out of a second season pass, because we want twice the DLC! the DLC is the original, higher quality game What super secret sub do they hang out in then Oh jeez, it is a good thing today's a saturday because I'd have definitely gotten caught redditing during work when everyone heard me burst out laguhing at how badly that fresco was ruined. It's like paying Nazi members a share of the concentration camp museums. Well that's good, now I don't have to feel bad for her anymore. Well, that's kind of like Borderlands 2 though.

They rereleased it on PS4/Xbox One in the "Handsome Jack" collection, and it looks so much better.

...They didn't rerelease it for PC because it always ran that good if your hardware could do it, and runs even better still if you have the hardware to do it. And then there's Daggerfall, which has loads of fog *and* possibly the biggest world outside of a space sim. As was Halo 1, though I was having way too much time swapping between original and HD mode. Yeah, it's a pre-order bonus for Fractured But Whole Do a lot of people feel this way? I thought I had some strange aversion to pot (exactly what you're describing) so I haven't smoked in a long time Toma tu upvote y lárgate You sound surprised. /r/youtired AC2 is the best of all AC games imo, a lot of my friends also think so, It's a shame they are going to shit on it with this "remaster" Their uncharted remaster is outta this world The only fuck up being where Eva's jaw meets her neck. The polygons don't quite tough. Otherwise it's perfect. Please be KotOR... I actually didn't even look i just assumed  You're supposed to use mods to make the game harder! Thinks like "Sneaking? Ha! Yeah right!", "Realistic item carry," and "Everything will kill you!"

That's a joke, but seriously, there are some great mods that make it more difficult, but in a good way. One of the most popular set specific enemies to specific difficulties so that they didn't scale with you. That meant some areas were best to save for endgame and others became a breeze at high levels. Is that near the start where you're trying to take down aryan la valette? Yes, it was explicitly said in the prequel. But it's based on The Thing ripping through clothes when it absorbed people in the 1982 movie. That alone would indicate it's unable to absorb inorganic material. I think it was a pretty safe liberty for the prequel team to take. I'm pretty sure there is a scene in the first one where they find a bunch of gold teeth in a sink drain after someone was absorbed. hold the fucking phone is there a prequel to the thing?????  •Michael Scott Bringing real renaissance back woah bro Clearly, he is an amateur quote maker. or find the "game of the year" edition that has all the dlc already on the disc Because for new games they don't toss away the codes. Pre-Order my ass. It's more like buy new for free shit. I was at my local Walmart the other day and they had a single copy of Overwatch Origins Editions with a code for the Noire Widowmaker skin. Y'know, the skin you got for preordering. Well, those museums wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the Nazis, they deserve reparations for it. Same as the Bioshock Collection.

1 and 2 got remasters for all consoles, but Infinite didn't get a remaster for PC because it was already at the highest quality. They just needed to bring the PS4/Xbone versions up to standard. Yeah but it's the same 10 textures and buildings repeated ad infinitum. What, are the construction paper cutouts sharper now or something? I definitely feel this way... Tried pot again after 5+ years, and around people it's horrible, and the feelings of social awkwardness are tremendous. But alone, I end up cleaning my house and binge watching hilarious 90's TV shows. Then I wake up the next day and thank my high self for cleaning the kitchen so thoroughly. I'm fine if I'm at a party where I know 50%+ of the people. Meeting new people... yeah not my favorite activity while stoned. I get really self-conscious, the "everyone's laughing at me" feeling magnified x100 I should be surprised.  After castle Sauerkraut fell to Lord Worcestershire's army; the Heinz troupe was disbanded.  Last I heard, the majority of us had either died fighting for other armies or became meals for the Humans.  *Grabbing popcorn*

Neither of you stop. I wanna ketchup on this story. It most likely isn't. EA, of all companies, has said no to remastered games. They don't see the point in them.

I know that sounds anti-EA since they're all about easy cash, but that was basically their response when asked about doing a Mass Effect and kotor remaster.

I hope they change their minds.  Did you just assume my render? You know what they say about assuming, it makes an ass out of you and ming Yes. In the first courtyard. Dead guy in white in a haycart. I guarantee most clothing is made from organic molecules.  I think they probably mean "living".  Or some variation on that.  Hair and fingernails are organic too, but aren't really living.

So if it can do fingernails it should be able to do clothes without metal in them.  Or at least composite dental fillings. Plus if it could eat inorganic stuff then it could have just eaten the whole base or anything else around it.   Wasn't there a theory from the original about Keith David's character not being absorbed because he had an earring in?  I don't recall that, but they definitely make note of how it doesn't absorb their clothing, leaving shredded remnants hidden around the complex. I think it was an interesting and logical angle to take for the prequel -- some people really poopooed that movie, but my only real complaint was their decision to go with cgi over practical effects, and adding cgi to what practical effects they did use.  Definitely not. You're thinking of the prequel Its just titled The Thing. It starred Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Not sure if before release it was announced as a prequel but the movies events lead directly into the original films (Dog chase) Yeah, it's not bad. Go watch it then then Carpenter one back to back.  Apparently it's been so long since I had seen the thing I didn't remember that they took a trip to the area of the prequel and saw the aftermath of the monster. Would it bake your noodle if I told you there was a video game sequel as well? With important developments to the lore?

Now THAT is a game I want to see remastered! I always read "Game of the Year" editions as "This is the product we SHOULD have sold you" editions Morally, this is appalling, but logically it's sound.  Nah, Cartman's just a wee bit fatter Please, stop. You don't have to remind me. I witnessed all the pain and suffering of our brothers as much as you did. I remember spending the many long nights after the siege of Sauerkraut walking the barren wastelands alone searching for any other soul that may have escaped. I thought everyone left behind had perished at the hands of that flavorless bastard. To finally see another soul spared by the kindness of the gods brings a warmth to my sauce I have not felt in years. Please brother, tell me of your life; I hope it has been kind to you after that fateful day. The annoying thing is I'm not usually a fan of most remasters, but kotor and mass effect I would be all over. Oh you son of a..... My sides almost rendered me unconscious  This comment is going places. Nobody puts Ming the Merciless in the corner! I would reckon that the thing works by using the DNA of the person being absorbed. So anything without that person's DNA is not replicated. Every fan of The Thing needs to see this video and I share it every chance I can. The prequel was filmed with amazing practical effects but the studio heads forced the director and producer to cover them up with CGI because "it looked like a film from the 80's." They also forced them to film another ending when the original was fucking brilliant because "It was too confusing." The reality is that the writer, director, and producer all adored the original film and slaved to make a worthy prequel, but the studio heads weren't familiar with the source material and didn't "get it." Most of this footage still exists and if the fanbase learns about it we will be able to lobby the studio for a directors cut. 

Please fucking watch this and spread the word. 

https://youtu.be/NxPK3sYb90w There's a really good video on YouTube of the teams practical effect work before they switched to cgi. Really drives home what a unnecessary decision that was.


Edit: I found the vid, it's probably NSFW and contains spoilers for characters.

Edit 2: forgot the actual link. https://youtu.be/fBzpT7VmSaU  The movie was meh, but god damn is she fine af. I enjoyed it. The cgi was a bit crap.  But I appreciated the attention to detail to make the continuity to the old film the best I have seen. If they had used real fx instead of the glossy cgi it would have been almost on par with Carpenters. As it is, it is a decent enough prequel that pays enough respect to the original without tonguing it's ear hole.  I, like you, wandered for many years, searching for our lost brothers and sisters.  I ended up stowing away in the sandwich of some human, and - aided by a Ketchup marksman - found my way to a strange village.  In this village, condiments rode around in tight packets, not bottles.  The villagers had seemingly never heard of the condiment wars, but after telling them my story, they decided to help me.  I was given a packet and some supplies.  That's how I found my way back to civilization. But now we gotta wonder, could the thing clone plants? >I coulda sworn I only had _one_ sock under my mattress...  Damn, I was not aware of this. I knew there were some practical effects, but they were enhanced by CGI. It's really annoying when studios get in the way of a good film, because they think the audience wants a certain thing. It's really inhibitive for filmmakers, and in these studio exec horror stories it seems like the execs have no idea what people (especially fans) want to see.

I really wish every movie had a director's cut and a studio cut released, because there's some movies that I'm really interested in what the director wanted to do, but was pushed aside by the studio. One recent one in particular being the Fantastic 4 reboot. It sounded like the director was getting really weird with it, but the studio wanted something more typical of a superhero film, which just ended up giving them a weirdly disjointed movie. Damn, that was a great watch. Thanks for linking it but now I'm upset because I wanna see the pilot version. That truly breaks my heart. 1982 Thing is my favorite movie. I was so disappointed that 2011 Thing used CG for everything. It really is the only complaint I have with the movie... It really irks me that the whole team put together this prequel that lovingly added to the lore and tried to be as respectful to the original as possible, especially wanting to stick with PFX. Then they got overruled by some executive cunts. Maybe some day we'll get what we should have had originally...

Edit: Thanks for posting the video link btw. I didnt know a lot of the stuff. I wish we would have seen the Thing 2 game. The original was pretty sweet. I was young at the time it came out and it honestly scared the shit out of me. I dont think I ever made it past the part where you fight the big one. The sanity/trust mechanic was interesting too but I remember it being pretty buggy. Thanks again. Its always nice to see a Thing fan.  I am a volunteer for your crusade where do I sign up? I've never seen the thing or the prequel. It's an understatement to say that what the studio did is a real shame.  Fuck, why the hell didn't they release a director's cut? That pilot alien looks amazing, and original the ending would have actually progressed the lore in a cool way (which is one of the main reasons to do a sequel...) MEW is a great actress, i loved her in 10CL and FD3. hope shes in an alien movie or a metroid one!  See u/RaisedByACupOfCoffee comment, apparently it could have been a lot better if not for meddling executives. Yeah, it's got more action and less puppets. Not a bad addition though. By the Divine Sauces, that is truly a miracle. I am glad to hear that your travels were safe. This has been the only good news I have heard since I found my way back. My entire family was killed in the war, their bodies left in the Trashlands. They had been dead for months before news even reached me. The world is a cold place. I do not know of your experiences but many people's do not welcome our kind. For a long time I was forced to live at bottom shelf in Pantry. Even the relish and sriracha's would turn away in disgust. My bottle felt empty. But I met many who felt the same way. Mayo, humus, and the likes all victims of condiment persecution. These flavors, once our enemies, have now become our closest allies. Brother, I know your time amongst civilization has been short but we must join together to tear down this system of condiment oppression and instill in a new order in which all flavors are treated equally in the eyes of the Divine Sauces! I wasn't sure how legit she was, until I saw the cape. "Ho hum let me just twirl over here." *half-hearted chopping* "Sigh." what stops you from spamming attacks? cant you just attack as fast as possible? like [this intense wii tennis match](http://i.imgur.com/WGL2dWb.mp4)?  Please let this bring the revival of arcade. They need to create some kind of gyro for those wires. I can see them getting tangled up in no time. The HTC/Nvidia/Scan Vive booth at EGX had a green-screen setup with a huge minigun and the Serious Sam VR demo. It looked fantastic but the wait time was quite long so my buddies and I just played the non-minigun one (with no camera or green screen).

Honestly it blew PSVR out of the water. When I heard the feint screams of those beheaded kamikaze guys and couldn't find them until I spun round and they were right in my face.. yeah, good job I was wearing the brown pants.

10/10, would poop myself again whoa this is so weird... I shot this video in Tokyo Game Show!  Here's some other photos from the same event... and I have a longer video.

... 

... 

(This is a warning.)  It reminds me of the star wars kid Star Wars Kid died for this. This looks actually really cool.... I would be the type of person to be scared as fuck and run into the wall I remember a vr game at Disney quest where you held something like a lightsaber and fought things (mostly giant flying bugs, I believe). I look forward to having a good vr ARPG in the near future. Also, the device does not work unless you are wearing a school girl outfit and a cape. waw, while understanding what I'm watching I suddenly tought, wow, cool she wears the same clothes as the character on the screen .... Of course it would be a school girl. why the spinning? There goes another generation of Japanese relationships. I find the idea of regular swords cutting through anything (each other included) like thin air very immersion breaking. [deleted] Need to paint the wires above green too. Does the Cape come with the headset or do I have to buy it separately?  Just like in Sam and Max Hit the Road!

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ozvrDRBtb6w/hqdefault.jpg reminds me of Dark souls. Man that would be so fucking amazing. Now I can die crippling and demorlizing deaths in person! Incredible.  Heh, would be cool if the game gave you "style points" for twirling around and stuff.  Of course for people with a normal VR setup they'd probably end up pulling their PC off the table. Awesome how into it she is.   I can't imagine playing and not being as pragmatic as possible.  Lmao is the outfit really necessary  I think VR's short term future possibly lies in stuff like this. 

At least until the hardware is cheap enough for mass adoption (and by that I mean console level popularity).

And wireless so I can use it in the garden where I've actually got space to flail around. A lot of houses were too small to use the Kinect properly, let alone a Vive. Imagine Metal Gear Revengance in VR with the Vive... This reminds me of that really fake Jedi video, I think when the kinect was originally unveiled.  The cape makes this so much better right off the bat though. I know these games will continue to get better,but this just look dumb, you stand in place, move out a bit and flail your hands around.  As cool as VR is, I just can't help but think it's a fad and gonna end up like 3d TVs in terms of "the next big thing"

Edit: Just to clarify I'm not commenting on the quality of VR technology or saying it's bad, but just because it's a cool/impressive technology doesn't guarantee long term, widespread success As a Vive owner since May, it's a total trip to see all these gamers who've never even *touched* the tech trying to explain to people what they see as the 'problems with VR,' or trying to explain how VR will be a fad. I'm not saying VR doesn't have its flaws at the moment, but *man* people are salty about it. I always thought that the VR cable is so limiting and dangerous because people can trip over them.  Then I see this genius of an idea, hang it from the ceiling. As a future physical therapist, if this stuff really gets going I'm curious about the kind of new patients I'm going to see. Particularly if this gets popular with those who have a low activity level, not just those who got into games like DDR, that were already more active.    The athleticism is unreal So this augment stuff suppose to make people playing virtual reality look cool? Fucking awesome.

1. Ceiling mounted cables, for which I'm shocked commercial solutions don't already exist.
2. Mixed reality filming, which should be the standard for presenting VR gameplay. r/anime_irl First step of Sword Art Online No wonder the tons of virgins. VR has a long way to go from being a novelty that looks good in demos and on video. You can see that she has trained for this day before They should paint the wire green.  "(hashtag)unnecessary movements." go ahead and down vote me you nerds.   Seriously, no wonder why people are weebs Wonder if these will become the "dedicated home theater" rooms of the future? in a few years from now, the video gamer college dropout in his mom's basement at 28 stereotype is going to be incredibly fit hah when will developers realize all we want is a vr game of a guy sitting on a couch playing mario That honestly looks boring. Is that what VR is mostly going to be like?  I personally can't wait until they have full submersion VR rigs  Looks good as Bobby Lee in Dragon Hunter 2.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZqoh2aUW7g She knew this was her destiny. Unexpected boon of VR. Everyone gets super into cosplay to immerse themselves even further, capes see massive resurgence. it's a mocap actor hired to show it off. regular people who don't regularly mocap fantasy anime will look significantly more stupid.  https://i.imgur.com/Lnrsh6k.gifv She's already figured out that extra force doesn't equate to extra damage and without anything to physically strike, you risk extraneous muscle damage. 
This is Wii-mote waggle 2.0. 

Edit: For the nit-pickers - PS Move 2.0. One Chop Woman [deleted] Everyone watching anime knows that the more ridiculous your fighting style the more effective it will be She's just grinding to unlock CGs of that cute ogre. Style points man!! Making the damage scale with how far you move the controller probably. So wiggling will do 1 dmg compared to a full swing at 100.  ***ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!!!*** [Vanishing Realms](http://store.steampowered.com/app/322770/) requires you to swing a certain distance before it counts as an attack.  That system works pretty well.  IIRC originally it was just "if your sword is in an enemy and moving, its an attack" and players found the exploit of just holding their sword in the enemy and wiggling their wrist, so the dev address it.  Now you have to swing and stab. Thank you so much for sharing that, I couldnt stop laughing for a few minutes. Why would you want to stop that? That wii match looks awesome that lasted a lot longer than I thought it would The longer that went on, the funnier it got to me. Especially when they finally break at the net, only to have the back player send it right back into the fray. In Wii Sports tennis, the user is flicking their wrist to get full movement on the on-screen avatar. VR will require a wider range of motion, which means your stamina will be the bottleneck, unless you edit the acceleration of the controller movements to cheat. Your endurance. Hah I'm gonna say lack of cardio. > what stops you from spamming attacks?

Getting tired. Any game that has some sort of melee so far has limited how fast you can swing before your sword stops doing damage. So you have to do thorough swings.  Holy shit that was amazing.  I could not stop laughing . **NEXT TIME ON DRAGONBALL Z!** fucking hilarious. Made my LOL in the car dealership, getting my car with a big smile will confuse the dealer a lot. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a gif.  Those guys obviously had Parkinson's.  It's like cheating at Wii Tennis really... Holy shit. This is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. I'm sitting here in the airport struggling to hold it together. Thanks for this.  That got funnier the longer I watched it.  That reminded me of myself when a bee flies near me. OMG. This  made me LOL so much! ROFL! I don't know why I found that video so funny but it had me cracking up lmao 😂 In Fruit Ninja VR nothing stops you. And I didn't know that until my daughter slaughtered me on the scoreboard just slightly chopping dual katanas around. That might actually work.

Physically curated space (so there's nothing for you to really break, maybe some soft padding), greenscreen like the above setup for other people to see the game, throw in food and drink, and you've got yourself a game night. It never died in Japan. Blips and chitz It would need two things I think, the system needs to become wireless, and giant hamster balls so you can actually move 1:1. People are working on it.

https://virtualrealityreporter.com/the-void-virtual-entertainment-center-pleasant-grove-utah-vr-multiplayer-gaming/ My buddy and I who both have Vives just collecting dust talked about opening a VR arcade. Rent out rooms to play VR in, I wanted to do a haunted house VR. Pinball machines are still awesome! All sharing the same sweaty, oddly dusty and half broken headset.

YES PLEASE! except the headsets would be covered in slimy pizza grease instead of just the controllers.  Super Bunnyhop just put a video out about this. Japan already has these in arcades and they aren't as impressive as most of their other stuff. He noted these had MUCH more staff and supervision.

[If you wanted to check it out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcgr2ThIWnk) I really like this guys videos too. I don't know how greek food is going to help, maybe a taco? They are developing a wireless addon atm. So expect no wires soon! :) The part you're describing is called "[Slip Ring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_ring)". I played 4 hours of Onward (a tactical FPS shooter on SteamVR) and at the end my cabe was about 1/4 the normal size because it was all twisted up. VR headsets either need to be wireless or we need a gyro mechanism that you hook up on the ceiling that doesn't limit your movements. Otherwise its brutal.  A gyro wouldn't be very useful, unless you mean a gyroscopic joint? Some kind of rotary joint would probably be cheaper Try the Brookhaven experiment. Zombie things coming at you out of the dark in a post apocalyptic environment, and you have a hand gun and torch. That's scary. I've known people just stop, sit down and take the headset off, it's too much for some.  Could you tell more about PSVR ? How would you compare it ? Where's the video?  Yep, not a week goes by on r/vive without a photo of a smashed TV. 
Throw down down some fitness mats so your feet can feel the safe zone and your good.  It's like the warning track in baseball.  You can blindly know where you're at. I was watching Idubbbz recently and he sort of pulls off some similar moves to that kid in his trip to philadelphia video, I wonder what ever happened to that kid. A visionary ahead of his time. [obligatory](http://gph.is/11dhDJP) Should I take my dick out? It's looks even cooler because her manoeuvres are pretty good. Whereas an average joe would most likely be flailing their arms around like on Wii.  Yeah but then you won't be able to buff your attack speed without going to the gym :( A semi-transparent grid shows up when you get close to the physical limits of the play space. Rip Disney quest. Most magical land in the universe when I was younger >where you held something like a lightsaber and fought things

I remember a lightsaber-style cylinder gripped with both hands, and both your thumbs had to hold down buttons to make the blade activate. That way you'd always have a two-handed grip on the weapon and wouldn't be doing wild one-handed swings. 

Can't speak to the bugs; I only had a chance to play it once, and that was probably a dozen years ago or more.  Yes! No one else ever seems to remember Disney Quest, and I definitely remember that game being awesome! Been waiting for good VR ever since (and now I have a Vive and it's everything I hoped it would be!)

There was also an Aladdin flying carpet race game, and I remember looking over at my sister in VR, and she was Abu! And whatever she did, Abu did (well her/his head)... When she confirmed the same experience from her respective when I shook my head... My mind blew so hard. [She/he's dressed like a school girl, does not mean is actually a girl.](http://imgur.com/a/xQ2lp) Cos style is like +5 crit. A E S T H E T I C S Because its *fun.* Its a good trick.

https://youtu.be/uBlhgAkJBos Just make them light-sabers and it all works out Its like having no clip turned on. Vernor Vinge wrote some great scifi where there is a vr themepark full of freaky metal robots - but when you wear glasses they turn into dinosaurs or whatever and haptic feedback lets you feel them. I can see that happening.  I'm sure it'd be even more immersion breaking if the giant had stepped on her... [miss that show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHsKv6Ecd6U&list=PL8MEGzZ3MpLd0OWrz8EZtpW5kBJlxgpA2&index=31) If you're buying a headset, chances are you have a cape at home already.
 The VR game Audioshield gives you extra points for dancing like a maniac. Absolutely.  It looks like that but when you are playing it feels way better. Why is everybody trying to judge this game?  We know absolutely nothing about it whatsoever.  This is like a 5 second gif of ONE moment of a battle sequence.  It could be a full on open world RPG for all the fuck we know.  

The actual cool part of the gif is their badass mixed reality real time setup.  This gif is not showcasing this particular game that we know NOTHING about.  Jesus. As someone who owns this exact headset (the HTC Vive) and lived through previous VR "fads" I'm telling you now that you couldn't be more wrong. 

This time round it's staying.  You've already got multiple brands of headset on the market, ridiculous amounts of content, the backing of numerous major companies and billions being invested. Not a fad, just early days.  It's not comparable to 3D TVs in any way shape or form...but it wont stop people making that claim.

The problem today is cost and continued development, and like all new tech, give it a few years and it'll just come down in price. Do you guys think you'd have smart phones today if we'd listened to all the nay sayers that said mobile phones where to expensive, to big or just for businessmen back in the late 80s, early 90s? do you think we'd have all the PCs and gaming consoles if people had listened to those back in the day that said "it's a fad"? 

Anything can fail but VR wont this time round if only due to the sheer number of companies with various goals investing it, something that cant be said for things like 3D TV.  

 I had a friend who thought the same thing, then another friend brought the Vive into work, and now he can't stop talking about it. 

It's really something you have to experience before you can judge it.  I feel the same way. I got a 3D TV back when they were popular. I spent like $4k on it too, and I still have it. It's a great TV but we never use the 3D on it because no one wants to wear glasses while watching a show. They're just in the way really. 

That's how VR 'headsets'(That's what they're called right?) sort of feel like to me. It's neat that you can do it, but am I really wanting to sit or stand there with this bulky thing on my head to play a game. 

Don't get me wrong, it's amazing that we're able to do something like this, and people who play driving or flying simulators would really have fun with this kind of thing. But your average person might not really play with something like this every day. 

We'll see how it pans out though.  Uh, the gaming industry didn't push 3D tvs like it's pushing VR. In fact, I don't remember anything ever pushing 3D tvs beyond, "hey these are a thing now, you can buy it to watch Avatar." Think of it like what the NES was to console gaming. It is the system that will launch an explosion of innovation in the industry. We may well end up in a very different place, but this is the start of a massive chain of innovation and invention. 

My money is on something similar to [the direction Magic Leap is going](http://www.wareable.com/ar/magic-leap-need-to-know-release-date-price-specs-features). Graphics will improve, devices will get smaller, and implementation will get smarter. The next 20 years is going to be amazing. It isn't. Technology is in a place where VR will only get better and it is already pretty great. Especially in high quality racing sims. Yeah as cool and immersive as it could potentially be... I think I will always prefer sitting on my couch with a controller in hand after a long day at work. Just wondering if you have used a headset before. Because I had your POV until I tried my friend's headset. 

He made me go through a tutorial program thing, and there was one time where I was overlooking this steampunk city scape, like totally not a real city. And to the left is a hand rail to "keep you on the platform", without thinking I went to grab the arm rail, obviously my hand went through/didn't appear on screen.

Once my hand is able to rest on that hand rail, I think humanity will stop reproducing and we'll go extinct VR was "the future" in the 90s. 3D was the future in the 00s.

Never believe anyone who promises "the future." VR ain't gon' catch on in this decade. *Maybe* In the 2020s. *While you practiced makeup and wooing boys, I studied the blade* A cell, from the prison of elders! Pokémon! I've always wanted to wear a cape in a socially acceptable fashion...Lets do it! No capes! Wait, capes haven't been in? Since when!? Is that what the HR email was about when it said "appropriate casual Friday wear"? Kyle wears sandals with socks and no one bats an eye, I have a cape and it's a big deal?  
Fucking Kyle. An actor in a school girl uniform and pretty lame twirling moves?

I'm pretty sure it goes like this: They give you the headset and the cape and let you play the game. They ask you to do a "cool fight move" by twirling around when your friend wants to film the whole thing. /r/sfwporngifs was a beautifully sad place The new John wick movie looks great I've always love the "Tada!" Hands at the end I'm the cook  That the new Steven Seagal movie?! Thats one of the funniest things I've seen Can I ughhhh... get a sauce for that? What is that from? It took me way to long to realize this wasn't from a Tom Green skit The VR Sword games I've played (mostly Vanishing Realms) made it so that you have to move the sword a certain distance (in a sweeping motion) for it to be counted as a hit, you can't just waggle the controller and it count as a hit. Found the expert who never played a vive. In my oculus touch app extra force and acceleration in your swing equates to extra damage. Have no idea why your comment is getting so many upvotes when it is completely false. That'll always be the problem with VR, there is no contact with anything so you quickly lose immersion.  Running without running, hitting without making contact, climbing without moving up, they all make you quickly leave the fantasy world and make it boring.  

VR's best bet for full immersion are games where you're sitting in a moving object and operating things that don't make contact.  Games that have you driving, shooting from a car, snowboarding, etc.  So very much like the VR movie theatres amusement parks have. There's a great video of the Giant Bomb guys screwing with VR and watching Jeff Gertsmann do the waggle with this giant headset on is just hilarious. There are a few games that measure force by how quickly a remote moves along side how far it travels. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zClxVxLOGt8

This one murdered my arms.  There are a number of VR games which do base damage on "force" of the hit already though (really more acceleration at contact).  Just because this game doesn't do that, doesn't mean the entire concept is wii-mote 2.0. you thought she/he looked cool? Monster Hunter motion values, anyone?! One of the boxing VR games calculates damage based on how back you pull your fist before going forward. This is how TV's die The twirling and jumping should add a multiplier.  **MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA** OH MY GOD! ***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ******ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^^***ゴ*** ^^^***ゴ*** ^^***ゴ*** ^***ゴ*** ***ゴ***

Just imagining this is real life got me crying Me too. I haven't laughed that hard in a while.  I liked how it appeared that the day/night cycle passed several times during one volley.  It went on for...just...that...long... =/ why how come i cant laugh at this There is a virtual reality fps game set in a huge room with multiplayer. Don't remember the name, but it was a zombie hoard game.  Ah, and don't get started on scaling it to teams!--I mentioned in another comment that if it models after laser tag with the spectator features you mention. DONE. I'm actually currently starting a business like that here in Quebec!

I installed the Vive in a cube truck, so I can basically bring the curated space anywhere!  I installed greenscreens inside, and I bought a huge exterior screen so I can project the video outside the truck.

So basically, a mobile setup like the one seen above! Just don't go back to the carpet store, take Roy off the grid instead The best part - the food/alcohol sold to the people watching might just keep the game prices reasonable. And could you imagine league play? Probably not long-term enough.  You could get what, maybe ten years out of this?  Before the stuff people have at home is better again. I'm basically doing one myself tonight! It's definitely a revival of social gaming, it's so great! 

 And rapid-fire, short-lived gameplay experiences as well. I can't see people wanting to pay thousands to buy this kit and the few small games it has, but I can see a lot of people being happy to put a coin in a slot and put on a headset for five minutes.

The question is, are enough people still interested in going to an arcade? The dream of the 90s is still alive! Part of that is because a lot of arcades own gambling businesses as well. You beat cancer and WENT BACK TO WORKING AT THE CARPET STORE!? Dibs on Roy! That’s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store. It would be cool if they did a whole B&C ep like they did with the channel surfing ones. VR Super Monkey Ball when!? You know how Hamsters can start running at a really good clip, trip over their own feet, and then start spinning around with the ball?

I can't wait to see that with humans. I suggest looking into the cost of commercial use of the games first. They range from hundreds  a year to thousands a year. It's not as easy as loading up your steam library and buying a game for $15 and charging others to use it.  http://www.pinballmuseum.org/ ever since i was a young boy... Hell yes!  Pinball forever! I think he meant a falafel. Ah, the old Reddit [food-a-roo](https://m.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/550sb4/valve_employees_do_play_their_own_game_after_all/d8755w1?context=2)! "There goes my gyro
He's ordinary" It would be interesting how big a battery you would need to run in for a few hours at the least. It's a screen and a bunch of sensors so I'd imagine it's feasible.  the reference was probably to the bike part that you use on BMX bikes that allows the back brake cable to not wrap around the frame when turning the bars multiple times. u r a slip ring Yup. Tried this at Spotify HQ. Was literally screaming. It really fucks with you for a while after as well. 

Played Space Pirates too. That was awesome.  ...I couldn't handle meeting the whale in theBlu. I'm a pushover. I tried PSVR at two different stands - Battlezone (by Rebellion) and at the Playstation (Sony) area.

Battlezone was fantastic. It's a bit like BZFlag - you're in a tank and basically rove around blasting bad guys. It was pretty immersive and the demo was well put together (little prompts to get you started - "Look up while your tank comes out of the bunker!" - that sort of thing). The Rebellion guys really knew the product. Lots of help getting started, putting the headset on, adjusting it, etc. I took my glasses off and, while I needed to adjust the angle a little on the headset, I got a nice seal cutting out the rest of the world. I was aware of people around me (footsteps vibrating up my chair when their photographer popped into the booth to take a no doubt hilarious picture of me looking slack-jawed in awe). Great experience.

The Playstation area (the largest of the whole expo - heaps of stands and games, loads of staff) was the complete opposite. The queues were terrible (made an appointment then still queued nearly an hour after my appointment time). The staff (wearing Sony gear but clearly drafted in for the weekend) were really poorly informed about the product. I got no help to get settled with the headset. The guy insisted I wear my glasses for a better experience (it really wasn't - the seal was poor and the outside world leaked in). The headphones volume was way too low - I could barely hear the game. The staffer didn't know how to turn it up. When I found the volume control after the demo, his response was "huh, I didn't even know it had a volume control". The game (Rigs) didn't lend itself well to a five minute demo. It was too complicated to get started with (whereas Battlezone was a piece of cake to jump into). I felt physically sick within seconds of the game starting - I thought I was going to puke! The staffer warned me some people reported that with the game - he said not to look around with the thumbstick while moving your head. The strange thing is, I never had that issue with Battlezone! Overall, it was a really bad demo and the Sony staffers didn't have a clue what they were doing (it wasn't just this one guy - all over the Sony stand and throughout the weekend the staff couldn't even tell me the names of a lot of the games that were on the big screen).

If I hadn't tried Battlezone, I'd have written PSVR off as a gimmick. Battlezone was great, but Rigs and the Sony demo proved it isn't fool-proof and there's gonna be some poor experiences that don't warrant a £350 investment. Its on my phone. Its like 2 mins long. If you wanna check it out, ill try to figure out how to upload it. On a business trip atm.  It's just like the first days of the Wii.

Rip flatscreens. Honestly people just need to make sure they have enough room/are paying attention to the in-game grid.

The Vive has a [Holodeck-like grid](https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/04/04/be26204f-6f21-4dc5-a75b-abe8981b4f08/thumbnail/970x546/89d8bcbf6a5b8bb2e3f636b0d2b4804b/htc-vive-bluecage.jpg) which appears when you get too close to the edge of the designated area so you don't flail/walk out of it.  It's been a shockingly smashed TV free month. Or set realistic chaperone bounds. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/05/04/whatever-happened-to-star-wars-kid-the-true-story-behind-one-of/ "It appears to be a terrorist training video"
"That kid has moves" that wasn't the star wars kid... wtf George Michael? That is the custom! All my time spent playing Dark Souls has lead me to this path.... I must unsheathe my Profaned Greatsword +5 and smite thine enemies.... With spastic flailing a là Wii Boxing..  Which makes it look rehearsed. We'd be better able to see how the game reacts to player input with a random, average Joe. Maneuvers looked completely unnecessary but she looks like a cosplayer so par for the course  Hi, I'm a gamer; I'm literally so physically retarded I can't imagine loosely imitating a superhero movie. This is mostly because my wilted imagination is lying dead at the bottom of my killstreak filled brain, but seriously, I just can't imagine how I would ever do sick moves like those.

 She also would have cut her arm off a few times if those swords were real. Agree. I was thinking that I'd just be standing there hacking away and probably freaking out haha VR has nothing to do with Wii: Wii was using controllers with crappy tracking to control stuff behind a 2D screen. Weird. VR has you use your hands very much like in the real world (one limitation being you don't feel the weight, the other being you don't cut your head and arms off when doing crazy moves).

You have to try it to get an idea. It's amazing ... and very physical (I could barely move the next day after playing a night of Space Pirate Trainer, Rec Room paintball and Raw Data). Not necessarily. I've been playing a bunch of Fruit Ninja for the Vive and being immersed in a 3D environment really helps you hone your movements pretty quickly. Link stays blue. so games are supposed to be *fun* now? gtfo of here Fun is for casuals. Let's be real real, haptic feedback will first and foremost be applied to pornography. Sounds like the equivalent to most people having sex. We all probably look very awkward but boy is it fun. I'm glad some people are singing it's praises. I see this and, rudimentary as it is, can't see how people think it's going to fizzle in the same way. This is a new technology based on several old failed ideas. Even if Vive, Oculus, Sony, or whoever aren't the first, this is the start of what will eventually be the fucking Holodeck. Once people try a web browser inside a VR headset, they're gonna be blown away.  Imagine browser tabs arranged in 360 degrees all around you; each tab playing different content from Pornhub.  It will be just like Darth Vader's meditation pod but sexier.

That will be the tipping point that takes VR into the mainsteam. I think some form of it will continue to exist, but I don't think this is really how people will want to play games most of the time after the novelty is gone.

In the same way the Kinect was neat for party games... so was wii sports... Rock Band... DDR... Nintendo's "~~Turtle~~ Power Pad". There's a long history of attempting to redefine how we interact - and the evolution trends towards less movement, and not more movement.

When we game for real, we just don't like moving around.  It's a great gimmick, but it's not what we do.

Eventually the "vive parties" will slow down (not that everyone's doing them as it is) because it's a pain to set up, only one person gets to participate at a time... Which is OK a limited number of times. But the novelty will wear off. At some point, it's a dumbass in the middle of the very real room that you have to exist in while his mind is in another world, and your sympathy runs out that his mind is in another world. You would rather that dumbass be *present*.

Which brings me to an important point: they're incompatible with families.

If I'm playing a video game and my kid walks up, I can see him, I can talk to him, I can deal with him. He can watch for a bit. I can take in all this information and decide, "what am I doing playing a game when I could be doing something with my kid!?". "Let's go play, buddy."

But if he walks up and I'm playing inside a VR setup... his Dad's gone. I'm somewhere else. I won't even see him in my periphery. I'll hear him, but my headphones are on, and pausing it is less easy because I have to take it all off to respond to him for real. I won't notice any of his emotions. My wife will be more frustrated. Plus, again, it's annoying for non-players that I'm taking up so much space with it. 

Sit-down VR games are going to be more likely in the future. But I think even with those, I think people will eventually value being in the room the game is being played in. Games where you lay down, perhaps. Maybe "movies". Porn. Imagine how taboo it'll be if it gets a rep for being a porn machine. (I mean, I know the pron exists, but the rep doesn't yet).

It's fun.  I really really like it.

In the end I just think the idea is not compatible with anyone but the player. And that really hurts it. Maybe everyone is single in the future where this is successful. Japan has that problem, why not us?


edit - wasn't the turtle pad. I'm not sure wtf I was thinking. That post seems the opposite of your username but regardless.

3DTV and the most recent iteration of 3D received very heavy investment from multiple companies looking to make a few extra bucks.  The argument that the recent 3D trend didn't have a lot of investment is bunk.  It just fizzled out due to the particular requirements to enjoy 3DTV (also the fact that there was also a large percentage of the population that literally couldn't see the 3D of the recent generation).  This doesn't make your statements wrong about the current iteration of VR but i still think it's lacking until we get into something that either resembles the holodeck from Star Trek (not likely given the necessity for hard light developments or something similar) or more like something from SAO where the VR takes away your actual physical movements without impacting your gaming experience.

That's not to say there is anything wrong with the current generation of VR, it has its uses, but it is going to be very underwhelming for a large portion of applications just given the particular limits of the current iteration of tech.  I think it's too early to claim that "this" is the VR that's going to survive it's "new and shiny" stage and i'm personally doubtful that it will. The issue I had with 3DTV were the glasses. I already wear a set of glasses, so putting on that second pair was a PITA. 

What about the HTC Vive or its competitors? Have they managed to solve such issues for the bespectacled population? I generally see people shutting their pie hole about it being a fad once they put a vive on. As someone who owns that headset and the content, what is the last time you played a game on your Vive?  
How much did you play last week? > Anything can fail but VR wont this time round if only due to the sheer number of companies with various goals investing it, something that cant be said for things like 3D TV.

Didn't practically every TV manufacturer jump on board the 3d band wagon?  I remember you could watch the world cup in 3D, that was when they were still expensive af. 

and then they dropped price a year or two later, I got one, and there wasn't any more content being made. 

 Sony did. They tried pushing 3d for the ps3 It is really unfortunate that the gaming industry didn't capitalize on the 3D tv trend. I played one of the Assassin's Creed games completely in 3D and it was awesome. Playstation did have a 3D feature where you could have two players share the same screen, like in a racing game but not split screen. You just wore different glasses so you only saw your screen. 

Racing games in 3D would have been awesome. Oh Crysis 3 was in 3D and I played that 100% in 3D. That added so much awesomeness to the game. I was a super sad panda when the current generation systems came out and did not support 3D. I for one cannot wait to have a screen attached to my face. At least the head tracking stuff with goggles would increase immersion without making you get up. Instead of looking at a screen you'd be inside the game. *The Draugr are training.* LoneBrit, go to bed already Fun fact, Antonio Banderas took a break from acting to go to fashion school because he wants to bring capes into modern men's fashion. If you just own it, you know, really *own* it when you wear a cape, be confident and unironic, people will really come around in thinking you're insane.  http://i.imgur.com/ruv4Qtx.jpg otherwise this happens

Edit: Was doing this on my phone and accidentally hit the timer bar before copying the URL. Could not for the life of me get it to copy one at the the start of the video or anywhere but that spot. It requires more precision of the motion input, yes. But you're still just miming the input.  I was going to comment saying I felt more immersed in my vive demo (tilt brush, space pirate trainer) then my psvr battlezone demo,  which is a "sit in your cockpit"  type game. VR has plenty of room for improvement but it's very cool to see how far it's come already  It really depends on implementation, a really bad implementation would do damage as long as the sword is clipping into the target's model. But if it's done right the only difference is less resistance and no force feedback. You've still got to move your arm from point a to point b with a purpose.

I've got a dk2, after the first 20 or 30 hours I was completely aware I was in a simulation. Tried a Vive, SDE isn't as bad but it's still there, and the controllers shake a lot (not heavy enough to smooth muscle twitches iirc). Too immersed isn't a long term answer, only better implementations. Make a hack and slash based on ghosts, problem solved. On the flip side, VR Jump roping would be safer than an actual rope.  I wouldn't mind just using a controller with a VR headset. I think I'd prefer that actually.  So, I've seen several approaches to sword combat in VR. 

First, if you haven't tried it before, it's really hard to explain how much sensation your brain fills in from visual data. It feels very uncomfortable to walk through walls or lean through a table for example. This applies nicely to this problem, since in my experience most people automatically retract their hand after hitting something, as if they made contact.

When people do get wild and start swinging through virtual objects, the games handle it in a few different ways. First, haptic feedback helps a lot to remind the brain "I made contact with something." The Vive has a great haptic system that feels a lot better than just a regular controller vibration motor.

Second, games like Vanishing Realms and I believe a few others make it so that your sword is disabled for a brief second after an impact, and it has to move a certain amount to reactivate. This eliminates the 'waggle' problem, and is virtually invisible to the player.

The best approach I've seen yet is Gorn. Gorn has everything on springs. When you hit with a sword or a mace, it flexes against the collision object. This is brilliant because it really tricks your brain into feeling a resistance against whatever you are moving it 'through,' but allows it to pass by the object with enough 'force.' 

The closest I can compare it to is if you've ever had your mouse cursor get stuck in a spot, or set up a dual screen setup wrong and you feel like your cursor is 'pulling' against the mouse, even though the mouse is moving fine. Not sure if anyone else has had that...

I felt the same way you did, but after playing these games, collision isn't an obstacle at all. Of course, it would be better with more realistic haptic feedback, but the lack of it really doesn't change the experience at all.

Locomotion is the big challenge, can't argue with you on that one, but things are getting better. One I don't hear brought up often is the lack of feeling weight in your hands when you pick something up, but again, it's a minor issue and your brain is often happy to fill in the gaps if the visual information supports your expectations. Opposite. She didn't look cool and still got the job done.

Is this what you mean? So a green room with various green structures you can arrange into VR obstacles with players playing a COD like game while people outside can watch in real time?  Obviously latency might be a bit of an issue but once that's inevitably figured out....then you can just take all my fucking money!!! Wow, that's amazing!  [deleted] But really think about how much Morty enjoyed a normal life. blitz and chitz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now sit back while I thrash your Roy score I think the barrier isn't having the technology at home, it's having the physical space for the kind of setup an arcade can have.  So the dream of the 90s is alive in Japan, Portlandia lied to me! Remember when people churned their own butter and carved their own ice cubes?  But that has nothing to do with arcades even if they're the same owners. 

Tons of people still go to arcades. Its where a lot of young people go socialize. Street Fighter V got huge backlash in Japan for not having arcade version. 

Arcade gaming is bigger than console gaming over there. Its also why internet cafes are huge.  Are you talking about Pachinko? They're separated a lot of times. I was in Tokyo a few months ago and there were a ton of standard arcades that were awesome. Most of it is because they have games that are extremely popular but only available in arcades. There is also a huge social aspect, in that you will see a group of like 6 people kicking it at the arcade after work.  Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet store motherfucker! He's taking Roy off the grid! I never knew how much I wanted this. Tell that to the other places around town that do the same thing, but not with VR :) I live here in Vegas. My wife took me there for my birthday a couple of years ago. Great gift.

$10 will last you all day if you play the older machines. I played the silver ball If those wires short, they might melt. This isn't Bill O'Reilly. Yeah, that'd make a whole lot more sense.  Hold my diarrhea, I'm going in! I imagine I'd get tired and need a rest before the battery does It's two screens but they aren't super bright or large, we can run a pretty bright and high res screen for quite a while with a cell phone battery. Not sure if the headsets have built in processors but the sensors shouldn't be too taxing I wouldn't think. Hardest part I would think is dealing with any latency, you'd really notice it if there was any delay in sending the signal from the PC to the headset. I wouldn't mind it being in a slim backpack like a Camelback It is basically a gutted smartphone. So, not that big of a battery.

The main reason wired headsets were used for gen 1 VR is because of latency concerns. The recently developed lithium batteries from MIT, I think, which will be made at a large scale next year will surely make the battery life good enough (up to 8 hours) without adding a ton of weight to the headset. I would link the battery but on mobile and on the bus. Originally called the rotor. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detangler I went through many of them in the 80s. Reddit needs you. Do not forget us. Although I already know what happened, it's always heartwarming to read that there is a happy ending to this and he's a lawyer now helping people in cyberbullying cases. Arrested Development.  I hope you're in shape, because Dark Souls in VR would require a crap tonne of rolling :D I assure you that it is rated E for Everyone. 

At most it is cringeworthy. I've heard a lot of people that have it say that it's got 5-7 mind blowing game/experiences, but after you experience those there's not much more to it.  Hopefully the pool of content will grow, but I can't justify paying $800+ for a one week gaming experience. just wait till people discover 3d porn en-masse.

 Biggest hurdle is getting people pumped to actually do stuff all the time while playing a game. 

The biggest issue here is how many will people use it for countless hours on end? 

There are a lot of people that put between 3-6 hours of gaming in one sesh and I doubt a lot of people will be doing that with these, not even bringing up that a lot of people physically couldn't do this for that length of time.

The tech here is great but without changing gaming habits, it simply will not survive and grow how people are hoping.

You say this is different but it's still got the same obstacles to over come. That sounds like it would be interesting for two minutes I agree with most of your points, except one;

>In the same way the Kinect was neat for party games... so was wii sports... Rock Band... DDR... Nintendo's "Turtle Pad". There's a long history of attempting to redefine how we interact - and the evolution trends towards less movement, and not more movement.

Rock Band/Guitar Hero is still pretty huge in America, and DDR is still a big thing in Japan.  It died out in America mostly due to fading arcade culture; consoles were starting to really take off (the XBox and PS2 had just released), so within 3 years of it hitting the market half the arcades near my house that had a machine shut down thanks to the rapidly expanding home market.

But yea, VR effectively isolates the user from the world around them.  As much as I like immersion, I enjoy having spatial awareness and being able to interact with those around me.  I'll never notice I got a phone call, that my SO came home, that my dog is shitting on the carpet, and I definitely can't show my friends the games I'm playing. It completely removes the user from the world around them, and there are huge negatives to that. > only one person gets to participate at a time..

This will definitely change as costs on these things come down and portability increases. I agree, as example cockpit games are perfect for VR, games like Star Citizen or Forza, because you don't need to move your body. The immersion with a good joystick or wheel setup is amazing except for the missing g-forces. 

Your problem with the isolation can be partially fixed with a 3D camera in front of the VR glasses that you can activate by one press. Not perfect but I'm sure that will be a thing in the future. In combination with a wireless, cheaper and lighter device. Honest question, have you tried it? The sense and feeling of presence you get in proper VR is amazing. 3D may have had similar funding to VR, but they are entirely different end user experiences. When you look down say a ledge in VR, you feel like you are high up. It successfully tricks your senses. You may know in your mind that you aren't going to fall and die. But it is very hard to make yourself walk over thin air, even if it's "just a video game".

You can clip your view point into walls, it took me several tries to do this without flinching. I expected for my head to hit the wall. It has its flaws, the first generation of everything does, but what it can do is like nothing else that exists or has existed. 

Everything has a starting point. I think the sense of presence and the very real feelings VR can instill in people, will create a mainstream market for it as the price is reduced. 

 You can wear the headset easily with glasses, provided they aren't exceptionally large.

You can now also order custom lenses for the Vive that are tailored to your eyes, so you don't need glasses at all. They run at around 60 bucks, so not too expensive. I have read accounts from people that have used the PSVR with glasses on and they have said that it's perfectly comfortable. 

They also mention it in this [Cnet article](https://www.cnet.com/products/sony-playstation-vr/).

I would imagine that was taken into consideration with the other headsets as well.  A good friend of mine owns a VIVE, I played for about 90minutes straight and didn't find the headset felt uncomfortable over my glasses. The headset provides ample space for large framed glasses like mine. The vive works very well with glasses. The depth of the lenses are adjustable. Some company also sells prescription lenses you can install on vive, but not sure how well they work.  My question is, if you're nearsighted, do you even need to wear your glasses?  Owner here. I play about 2 times a week with friends. And anytime anyone new comes over they will try it. 

I play a lot of holo point, space pirate, job sim, and holo ball. Also hanging out in Altspace is a usual weekly thing.  True. Especially if you're playing sim games (e.g. elite dangerous, war thunder, project cars) where you're sitting in-game anyway. Head tracking is a huge feature in dogfights, and VR will make things like TrackIR redundant once the resolution hits a critical point. That's all I really wanted out of vr.

But people have claimed games that move you around without you physically moving makes you nauseous. Hopefully better technology will fix this. [They are](http://imgur.com/gallery/8M1cj3Q) *Finishes shooting Zorro*

"You know, I'm going to miss this." He is the hero we need. That is like a huge step up from weird! Or depending on the time of year they may just think you're a nerd with no life. [deleted] Yeah, I mean my cat has a breakaway collar. I'd imagine superman can have one too. Never noticed the cape. That's tragically hilarious.  Of course it is. I don't see why anyone would think it isn't.  ["I hate dust"](https://youtu.be/xm06GixEW48)

Not from a porn, but looks like one. The Amazing Bulk is one of the shittiest movies I've ever seen. Haha, oh Randy, you goof.  I love the eye bulge that he does so much, few things make me laugh harder than amazing facial expressions [Dirty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wBLUBa8YI) This man actually has the touch of death. He merely fakes snapping necks so not to give it away He plunges into something alright  https://youtu.be/JxxNvfVfDB0

Cabin boy becomes Cabin Man. Let's not be ridiculous, you were already watching nsfw porn weren't you? How do you not mime the input since you're not hitting something?  Surely everything is a mime until at least haptic feedback. You say that like it's a bad thing, but swinging a virtual sword is infinitely more engaging than spamming A to attack. Well the speed at which you do it at least becomes important. The feedback is the part that's missing. No weight to whatever you are supposed to be holding, and no impact when you hit something.  

That's quite a challenge though. Hah, you fool. In real life swords have virtually no effect on ghosts. So much for realistic immersion.... She could've gotten the job done without twirling and wearing a school uniform with a mantle on. Gotcha Bitch! First time that I cut off a tail with 2 hits I was sold on Great Sword. shit! Goodbye sharpness. It's also Rising up to the challenge of our rival DORARARARARARARARARARARA That is the coolest thing I have ever seen. I can't wait for this to be a common experience like lazer tag [deleted] $88 for 45 minutes of VR Lazer tag.   Part of me is excited for this. The other part me knows how much further that $88 bucks cold could go.  I could really see this being where vr flourishes first. The problems of vr (large space required, expensive equipment) could all be solved by doing this type of thing. I could see it replacing something like laser tag Yeah... just looking at the danger effect and the retard look, I think VR is going to be reworked into augmented reality and bring laser tag massively back into fashion.

If I can choose to be a retard alone swinging nothing and maybe breaking shit, I know I'd rather choose be a drunk retard with friends swinging toy sword in a room full of shit that looks cool through magic glasses.

Basically what disney does but now with more freedom. This is already going to open within a year. [It looks fucking awesome, btw.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cML814JD09g) the only problem with this is... if you want people running around real obstacles and stuff, you lose a lot of standard video game technology

like... in a shooting game, if you shoot someone, they fall to the ground and disappear

in laser tag, they are asked to politely turn around and walk back to their base or whatever

i *do* think competitive team-based VR will be amazing, it will just have each player in their own green-screen phone booth At $88 per 45 minutes of play that might not take very long.  16k CAD, but that's with a shitty truck that we need to replace.  It cost 3k, it's all broken and now we need to buy a new one.

Granted, we're in Quebec so the permits and licenses probably aren't the same than where you are. I never thought of it like that and now I'm sad A life that he will be denied because his crazy grandpa came back into his life. At least he got to experience it in Roy I guess. Blipz* Exactly. Placing a room scale VR setup in your house is difficult and expensive even if you have the space. Especially if you want it to be not ugly and not break things. The dream of mainstream gaming and cartoons is alive in Japan.  Well yeah the dream of the 1890s is alive in Portland. Easy mistake to make. Why would Street Fighter not make an arcade version, do you know? That's the #1 arcade game in my mind. Yea legally they have to be separated but they are still owned by the same owner. This guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy! That sounds like it would be an awesome birthday. If I could somehow just have a day of beer, pinball and friends I'd be set. Hopefully they store them properly, or they'll all get sandwiched together. Yeah give me real full-body VR on this level and I will give you the time it takes mini drone to fall out of the sky.  Half-heartedly.  Hell, give me a battery pack that I can just connect with a cord and place in my pocket This is what the larger attractions are using and some companies like Alienware and msi have [shown off concepts](http://imgur.com/a/SZtZD). Gotta upload a gig on 3g.... 😢 Thanks for the tldr, I didn't know that but it is a good ending.  It was very weird when I found his picture in a graduation plaque at my law school. if the player character and enemies had good hit boxes, dodging stuff would be awesome! not sure about tracking full body accurately without approximation though. They have a core problem right now in that VR is very good at a few specific things, and very bad at a few other things. These restrictions create very obvious solutions and routes that games tend to go down, so many of them end up being very similar experiences.

There's also the unfortunate fact that one of these restrictions is player movement, and player movement is extremely important to many genres of game. So until we see that problem solved I don't suspect we'll see a lot of full scale games in VR, and will instead continue to see the sort of minigame style games that are already there.

I suspect the use of VR in the wider industry will primarily be using the VR headset in conjunction with controller input that controls the characters more like a standard game control scheme, similar to what the Wii did with Skyward Sword. At least, for a while. 60 bucks compared to actually buying glasses is pretty damn good. Glasses are one of the biggest scams out there.

When I say scams, what I mean is the vast majority of glasses all come from one company and they are intentionally ripping you off. Do you have to wear glasses for a Vive for both long- and short-sightedness?

I'm shortsighted and things a few inches away are perfectly clear; it's only when they get further away that they get blurred. As the screen is only simulating distance and is really always just a couple of inches away, surely I should be able to see clearly regardless? Just like how if I'm not wearing my glasses, I can use my phone camera to see more clearly at distance. They really are.  My glasses are pretty wide and fit in a PSVR completely comfortably.

They did not fit in an early model Oculus. I'm nearsighted.  I haven't had a chance to dick around with a vive, yet, but I've used a Samsung gear vr.  Had to adjust the focus a little bit, but yeah it worked perfectly fine for me without my glasses. Differs heavily between people. I don't have a problem with it myself, but it's a common problem. I'd imagine it will be a long time before the technology will allow for it, but it seems like the best way to allow for movement in VR without actual physical movement would be through some kind of brain implant technology, or even just brain scanning. To be fair with max smithing and max enchanting and max potions you can get weapons that deal 100k a hit I forgot that comic exist. Now to go and reread it! Not all heroes wear capes, just the cool ones.  But not the one we deserve.  Being crazy definitely has one over being weird.  Superman doesn't need one, the cape will give before his neck/collarbone/shoulder does. In the comic it's stated he got stuck on the door and got shot afterwards. ["We are almost at the end of the movie, and we haven't even used all of our stock-footage yet."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHjhdFh2oso)

 This doesn't actually answer his question. just have a family member stand in the way of your swing Make a sword out of this:http://www.toysrus.com/graphics/product_images/pTRU1-23289366enh-z6.jpg

Your argument is invalid. But who doesn't want to be *almost* anime? Yeah but that's no fun. Get the fuck out of here Josuke. Adults are fighting. ARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARIARI There is also [The Void](https://thevoid.com/) but it relies on [redirected walking](http://gfycat.com/LargeIllegalGrayfox) so needs to be co-op for what they are working on now.  Listened to [this podcast](http://voicesofvr.com/436-providing-wide-area-tracking-for-vr-arcades-with-optitrack/) recently with a guy from OptiTrack and there seems to be some cool stuff in the works when it comes to attraction VR. 

I think something with [inflatable](http://inflatablewallcompany.com/) or[ rolling reconfigurable](http://www.hufcor.com/products/detail/flextact-tactical-training) walls for level design turnover would be really cool. I manage a decently big family entertainment center...I have the vive because I know vr can revitalize arcades.  I'm just waiting to rip out our laser tag and replace it with vr in the future.   This is what you're looking for https://thevoid.com I thought about this a *lot* when I was a kid, 12 years ago or so. It was going to be called Hologun, and would basically be laser tag but with (what we know know as) hololenses on. Big lights from the ceiling would concentrate on points on the ground, where the hololens would imagine up a big monster that you'd have to shoot, and then the gun itself would track and see if it hit the light (like the old nintendo light guns). Pair this with coop or regular laser tag as well, or things like capture the flag or whatever you can come up with that involves guns, I think it'd be pretty cool if it could be done. Whether AR or VR end up being the end game I could care less....as long as I can still be a drunk retard That's all marketing. I would be shocked if it was actually that cool the first time around.  I really really hope they don't NMS this It looks cool but I'll believe it when I see a real time demo.  Besides the big plate of cheese, it looks like it could be fun. I like the mix of simple practical effects w/ the VR.
I'd just worry that it's geared for little 5-10 minute adventures, which kinda kills the whole thing for me. I need this. They can still disappear from the game until they walk back to spawn, though. Walking back just becomes their respawn timer effectively Exactly. He died happy in Roy but then he goes back to his crazy real life. I've got one, had to rearrange a bunch of furniture, get rid of a bunch of stuff, and take a cieling fan down (after blasting through a lightbulb) it is a hassle indeed. The game was released unfinished, as is tradition these days, and didnt even include an arcade mode.  [Ah, sandwhich](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/28492187211855350/75F816630FB9E473EFDE524EEB6BB06B6174FAD5/) Lmao use wifi you sick bastard Thanks for the tldr of his tldr.  With a VR Dark Souls forcing you to dodge everything with your real body, sprained ankles, broken spine and wall smashing would all probably happen way too quickly. Dark Souls 3 actually does have really good hitbox detection.

http://i.imgur.com/4k4uDsd.gifv

Obviously you couldn't pull those moves off in VR but with that type of hitbox detection you could pull of some really cool stuff. >There's also the unfortunate fact that one of these restrictions is player movement, and player movement is extremely important to many genres of game. So until we see that problem solved I don't suspect we'll see a lot of full scale games in VR, and will instead continue to see the sort of minigame style games that are already there

Yep. It would be tough to simulate, for example, a basketball game because it would have to essentially be on rails. Until we all can afford large, multi direction treadmill setups, I don't see vr picking up that much steam. It'll stay niche, I'm guessing. 

EDIT: You guys.. "Why not just play basketball?" Because I'm not an NBA player. I love playing basketball. It's obviously different from 2k, where I can run full speed and hit demar derozan with a crossover and throw it up to Blake griffin for the alley oop. I don't have great ball handling skills, I can't dunk, I can't even go up with my left hand. But Chris Paul can, and it's cool to pretend to be a great basketball player. Just like it's fun to pretend to be a wizard, or sexually repressed psychopathic meth head trailer trash who's in love with their mom.  >I suspect the use of VR in the wider industry will primarily be using the VR headset in conjunction with controller input that controls the characters more like a standard game control scheme, similar to what the Wii did with Skyward Sword. At least, for a while.

As somebody that has experienced quite a range of VR titles with the vive and oculus, I can tell you that the controller approach to moving around is terrible for VR. Any kind of character movement that you are not doing/feeling IRL, especially any kind of roll, will make you sick pretty fast. Honestly the current vr only works well for "cockpit" experiences. Where either you are in a cockpit of some sort (racing, spaceship, etc) or the area you are confined to actually makes sense in the game 

Something like a VR mario kart where you actually have to use one hand to through/use the power ups could be really fun and work pretty well > There's also the unfortunate fact that one of these restrictions is player movement, and player movement is extremely important to many genres of game.

Another is Actions Per Minute. Between player movement and actions per minute, that covers nearly every AAA title every made. Indeed. The lenses you get from the Walmart vision centre probably came from the same place as the super-boutique in the mall. And frames are frames, nothing special about them, other than the logo for whatever is the Big Name to have currently.  I am hopelessly nearsighted, can't make out the faces of people a few feet away without my glasses. I have to use them when I wear my Vive, but it fits over them just fine. And I have the big nerdy "hipster" glasses with thick frames. I also have an abnormally large head. These headsets are quite well-designed. I've demoed my Vive to a lot of people with glasses and without, and we've never really had an issue. and with one simple exploit, you can get 1.3 billion damage on an iron dagger. NO CAPES.  You guys got the quote backwards I think Superman would look better with a collar. And the cape was added to the costume by the bank he was hired to protect because it looked "more heroic". wtf is going on here? No he definitely covered it. I remember  "so the bulk does what he does best baby, he runs."

Followed by him talking about how he thinks they just had a bunch of stock footage left over and decided to just chuck it all in there as a "fuck it, this movie is already shit" Yeah, it's not a movie - it's a masterpiece! Oh yeah, that's where I watched this film for the second time. Good commentary was so much better. Especially during the first scene of the movie where he broke down the hookers path using that theatre. >I love [...] bulge [...] so much, few things make me [...] harder than [...] facial[...]s

Coulda even left the amazing. I see you work for the media. "Honey, can you come here..."
*later*
"I'm telling the truth officer, I was fighting a dragon" **WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SAY ABOUT MY HAIR?!** There are so many awesome possibilities here but, after watching the Void video, I really hope companies implementing these systems lean less toward a linear rollercoaster ride and more toward building open ended environments where players can act creatively. Thanks for linking that podcast. Super interesting stuff. Why rip out laser tag?

Odds are the future of laser tag is to use same arenas that already exist and have that be the baseline for the simulation. Otherwise you're left with a VR arena that is perfectly flat and no physical walls.

In other words, the VR simulation is going to match the physical environment with all the walls and ramps being in place, they will just look like whatever you want.

The laser tag games could be player vs player like they are now or you have the option of going against AI enemies. 

If done properly VR "laser tag" has the potential to be huge. People will jump at the chance to kill zombies, aliens or Russians with their friends. I don't think alcohol and VR places would mix well. I just entertained the idea of somehow creating one of these places myself, and thought my place wouldn't serve alcohol. It's a pretty strenuous activity it would seem like, as well as motion sickness while drunk is much more common, and I feel like VR goggles would exacerbate motion sickness. I wouldn't want vomit all of my shiny new VR arenas  I'm all down for the usage of "Don't NMS this" being a thing now.  I was just thinking, how many of my friends do I need to get together to scrounge up enough money to open a franchise... Yeah, but then you might run into them if you can't see them Imagine a teenager or someone similar trying to convince others to do that. I had a hard time convincing my parents to even let me move the living room table to allow me to play Kinect. Such a shame.  Saaanvich and meeee goin to kiiick your aaass. Thanks for.... uhhh.... nothing? just level agl Rule #1: Git gud. VR or AR will eventually get a good edge into the market (something like how mobile games got an edge, though mostly in casual gaming). There's no doubt about that, but what I'm really curious about are more hardcore games. VR has been rather casual now, as noone has quite figured out how you move around (Why the fuck has nobody thought of using a harness to suspend you so your feet hardly touch the ground. it's super cheap and effective IMO plus takes little space. Even things like turning would be easy) But if those issues get resolved, then we can expect a great deal of more hardcore games where some people may have to work out just to beat a final boss. 

Anyways I'm hyped for what VR is going to be, when small but incredibly high def displays come out and when one of the VR companies takes motion tracking seriously Pretty much, it's just too much hardware.

Now, if we manage to develop VR ala The Matrix (aka it's all in your head, no realworld movement) then well, society will die lol. There are things like flying, racing, mech, (hopefully there are others, but I can't think of them) type games where staying put in your seat is a believable part of the action. If I could look with my head and move with a controller I'd be happy. VR doesn't need full blown simulation to pick up users. It doesn't necessarily need a treadmill or similar to work. I saw a video a few months ago with a dev who was working on software that would make you think you were walking in a straight line when in fact you were walking in circles within your playable area. 


Can't find the exact one but it seems like there's a few similar projects going on that should hopefully solve space issues:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Zrjz_hu8I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8pw81VbMUU This is sad for me. As a wheelchair user "forward" on a joystick is my natural mode of movement so using a controller for VR experiences don't make me sick or pull me out of the experience.  All you able bodied people are really screwing me out of awesome experiences.   I went to a VR panel and one of the universal don'ts was forced player movement, for precisely that reason.  One of the games discussed was a VR equivalent to a point and click adventure game -- to change locations you'd "click" on a door or something and the screen would fade to black, then fade in on the new location.  This counteracted the motion sickness aspects.

That said, space games (E.g. Elite: Dangerous) are excellent candidates for VR -- the player always has a fixed reference to orient themselves to (the cockpit) so the motion sickness aspects are largely negated, and graphical requirements are often lower which means better framerates and -- more importantly -- lower latency.

(Input lag is a huge contributor to motion sickness as well, particularly when there's a noticeable delay between turning your head and the camera reacting.) Draugr *hate* him! Your face is backwards. Yeah, a nice suit and maybe some glasses too.  "This city is dying of rabies. Is the best I can do to wipe flecks of foam from its lips?" The dialogue in that comic is fantastic. C movie. "Sir, my wife and I fight sometimes too, but you can't just call her a dragon. That's like a mother in law term." Go on. Say something to him Josuke. Let him have it. >People will jump at the chance to kill zombies, aliens or Russians with their friends.

One of these things is not like the other
 Not to mention having a bunch of drunk people around and wearing your very expensive VR equipment.   Could have them just be semi transparent/some kind of ghost or spirit modeled to solve that. Depending on the game it could play into other mechanics like resurrecting teammates too "You leave that coffee table alone, Billy! That's where it's been for the last 20 years, and that's where it's going to stay!" You're welcome! Thnks fr th mmrs WHAT RINGS U GOT BICTH It is my life goal to life long enough to see something like this..  and then abandoning reality for it As someone clumsy and with no natural grace, I would agree with this.  I just want a helmet and a well-designed controller. Agreed. My primary interest in VR tech lies in being able to look around me in flight sims, space sims, racing games, and simulation based FPS games like ArmA/DayZ, all of which have you sitting in place using input devices for player movement. I got to test out an Oculus setup on Warthunder at work, and while it wasn't perfect because of the screen door effect and low resolution, it was amazing nonetheless. The fully immersive VR mini-games are neat, but that's not what I would end up buying a VR setup for.  It does, though. If the brain sees your body moving but your legs and sense of balance says your sitting down, you're gonna get motion sickness. You couldn't play any fpv games that way, anyhow. Strategy games or other stuff that doesn't really need vr works fine. That still needs big space, which isn't going to work if vr is going to be big for home use. Well, I am of the belief that this technology won't develop to be like a holo deck or something, rather the technology will fool your mind and senses. There are just infinitely more possibilities for anybody that way, because you aren't limited to your physical abilities and laws of physics. One of the first AAA VR games will feature a protagonist in a wheel chair because people do not get motion sick if they pretend they are sitting in a wheelchair. I think it is the next big game from Starbreeze actually. sponsored daggers by Taboola :( Rorschach's inner monologue is always amazing. B.... B..... BAKA Good catch, the aliens aren't from Earth like the other two. It's a festivus miracle! "You're welcome!"

tl:dr: yw More of a sword art online VR instead of x-men's danger room. I feel I prefer this idea aswell. Are you serious?  That's pretty hilarious. The main antagonist can be stair, curbs, and swimming pools. I hope that they can capture the frustration when your chair stops working in the middle of public. Or the claustrophobia of being waist high in a crowd of people. 

Edit:  I can't wait to play VR and be truly free!  And.... I'm in a wheelchair. ): I really hope we figure out a way to do that within my lifetime. It'd be amazing, and I'd totally blow all my money on it.  implying that we didn't all eat our own salt just to see it's effects.  I'm more salty about all the people trying to make every sub political.  Love this continued rhetoric of "the worlds gonna end QQ, im leavin" Reddit should be renamed The Dead Sea. You could float on all the salt here.  I voted (D), but I started to get excited around midnight.  It was really going to happen!  Not only would Trump win, but (R) would OWN EVERYTHING.  It was historic!

They won all the keys!  No more excuses, or just stonewalling.  (R) has to govern now, lets see what they can do when there's nobody else to point a finger at! This is going to be a wall (inb4 10 feet higher jokes) of text but I urge you to read through it, even if you just skim it. (It might sound a bit sanctimonious but know that it isn't meant to be)

The Election is over. The shitfest that is known as the 2016 election is finally over. Donald J Trump has won. It's not the result some of us expected, but it's the one we got, and we have to live with it.

I'm seeing a bunch of #notmypresident comments on the internet and it makes me depressed. I'm not even a Trump voter, I voted Hillary, but it reminds me of how many people rejected Obama after he won with #notmypresident comments. Rejecting reality and creating divides does nothing but separate us not just as a nation, but as *people*. As Americans, it is our duty to support the president in creating a new and better nation, because like it or not, Democracy goes both ways, not just for Democrats. Because if we try to reject Trump the way people rejected Obama when he was elected, are we any better than them? Not to mention it's just immature, at least to me.

I've been a gamer for a long time, so when I see stuff like this it reminds me of when someone loses in a game online and goes insane the the game chat with stuff like:

>[Insert username here here]: Wow good fucking game. Hacker much?

Or like when someone wins and decides to be a dick about it.

>[Insert username here here]: GG EZ Git fuked you casual Uninstall gaem

(Side note: I'm not saying Trump supporters shouldn't be happy, they definitely should be. After all Trump won the office against all odds. Just saying that now that the election is over, it's time to calm down a bit and look to the future)

What I want, what we **all** want, is to put this election behind us. To go back to normal before we had to worry about whether to vote for "Crooked Hillary" or the "Monstrous Donald Trump". To become fellow Americans and neighbors just having fun together. Watching Football and cheering for our favorite teams. Talking about how the new Star Wars ~~wasn't all that great~~ Ok fine it was pretty good I guess, about why Apple's new Iphones are terrible in features and price.. Seeing how much we can outperform our neighbors in house decorations on holidays. You know, like friends. At least with the casual politeness you see people treat each other with on the street.

Going back to the Gamer analogy (I know it might be cringe-worthy but bear with me), you know what the best part of gaming is for me? It isn't just the game, or the rush of an intense round in a game tournament, it's the community. Sure you have someone acting like a jerk every now and then, but most of the time you get to make friends with people you can just have fun and be happy with, even if you aren't of the same beliefs (political or otherwise), people you might never meet otherwise.
I'm not saying we as a people are perfect, or that we ever were. But I am saying that we at lest have the capability to come together as Americans and people despite our differences. Even if it is in things as superficial as sports and movies. We can be just neighbors again. Not "Redneck Trump supporters". Not "Shillary" supporters. Just neighbors.

**EDIT:** Ok I'm not saying the new Star Wars was BAD. IT was pretty good, but it wasn't THAT good. Just a bit overhyped.

**EDIT 2:** I'm seeing a lot of talk about how things can't go back to normal because of how Trump won. Because of the "poor and uneducated idiots" who voted him in. 

**This kind of thinking is EXACTLY what won him this seat in the first place.** Nobody like being called racist, misogynistic, uneducated, etc. Are the things that Trump has said racist? I believe so. Are some of his supporter Racist. Again I believe so. But screaming and name calling isn't the way to change things. 

Simply put, would YOU listen to someone who didn't take you seriously, thought you were an idiot and called you names? 

I thought not.

The best way to change people's minds is NEVER through anger and hate, but through polite and casual conversation. You need to remember these Trump supporters aren't just Trump supporters. They're people.  They have families. They have friends. They have dreams, they have hobbies they enjoy, foods they like, foods they hate, TV shows they can't wait for the next season of, favorite Video Games. You have to remember that they aren't evil. They aren't your enemy. hell a good amount of them are gamers just like you. With their own favorite games and with their own gaming fandoms to geek out over.

Let me repeat that. **They are Just. Like. You**. All that's different is their political ideologies. It's time to stop looking at each other as evil Democrats/Republicans and start looking at each other as Americans, more than that as people.

The next time you see someone from the other party that differs in political ideals. Don't name call, don't get aggressive. Be friendly, because like I said, nobody likes being yelled at. And if you guys can't agree? Agree to disagree. Having different political ideals doesn't mean you can't be friends, I have a good friend who voted for Trump, but I still respect his right to an opinion like he does mine. Isn't that one of the great things about this country? Freedom of speech? You know some countries don't even *have* freedom of speech?

Bottom line is, don't be mean. Instead, try to be friends (and I KNOW how hard that can be, but best case scenario you have a new best bud to roll with, and worst case is you don't. What do you have to lose?) because as long as we continue hating "the other guy". Nothing is ever going to get done and nothing will change in the long run. the two party system will **only** get worse and so will our government. 

After all, aren't we all just tired of being at each other's throats instead of just getting on with our lives and having fun fucking around with each other? Isn't that what gaming is about? What we as gamers are about? Having fun with each other? Im finding out i dont like most people on reddit, even now people are still 100% sure of their opinion. The echo chamber just keeps on going and no one has the slightest intention of self examination. Same as before, find someone to blame, because "it sure as hell aint my fault, and i know exactly whos it is". 
So im kinda salty cause i think this has ruined reddit for me. http://imgur.com/a/Mn5YY Nah. That salt pie has a value of two. Reddit opinions ain't worth shit.  WHAT IS A MAN? Nah, there's way more salt than that. Main thing is that there was a peaceful transition of power. It's something Americans take for granted. I've lived under two dictatorships. It's actually pretty common around the world. I dunno if the whole 'u so salty' meme thingy, heck any meme thingy, should be applied on a democratic election. I feel like we all kinda lost the feel for what's reality and what's just fucking around online.  Only three? I'd say it's an honest four. 11/9 is the opposite of 9/11! What's the matter, someone steal your sweet roll? [deleted] We're not all salty. Correction: "Reddit everyday" I honestly haven't really seen salty today, more of just pure sadness. People are genuinely just sad. Gonna need some dank skooma after this election The special edition keeps crashing on me. I think it has something to do with my steamy controller. 20 minutes and boom, tuff actin ticrashin When you talk about salt you summon it. There is no meaning to this post other than to stir shit up. If trump wins a second therm we'll be the first ones to briefly witness the formation a pure sodium star. The internet troll population really latches on compulsively to these labels, don't they? Salt, SJW, cuck...it's like the shared language of the hateful and illiterate. Ha, look at this novice alchemist Reddit, upvoted a low effort post to the front page of /r/all. That is Reddit every day, 4 years of unknown we have to discover... Implying this isn't Reddit everyday. I'd wonder who stole their sweet roll. Of course it's salty, the winner straight up said the vote was rigged.  Figures a Trump supporter would wield the mace of Molag Bol Jesus, this is some low effort content.  I don't know it seems to be mostly gloating Trump supporters A lot of people are just afraid Lol, our president doesn't believe in global warming, I'm so salty about that.  I was planning on studying today but these results have me depressed.
I can under sat and how people dislike Hillary and it should have been Bernie in the first place.
And the house and senate are under his control....
I can't understand how he got elected ignoring everything and looking at policy's alone he's so unprogressive and backwards on most positions.  I guess I underestimated how stupid and gullible the American people are
HE THINKS GLOBAL WARMING IS MADE UP BY THE FUCKING CHINESE! How is this man our president.... Kayne 2020? The politics may divide us, but we all love our games. Salt pile + dwarven oil = potion of regen magic. Great for spamming alchemy, using or selling for speechcraff.  Do you think this is a fucking game, Susan???! Isn't this every day on the Internet? Either kill republicans or you can't complain. Rightfully so Na Everyone keeps saying trump will start world war three, even though he's just continuing attacks on the Middle East. Did you guys forget that Hilary wanted a no fly zone over Syria? Which would start a war with Russia? The Middle East won't start world war three. But fucking Russia will  There's a difference between being upset because your candidate lost and being terrified because an unpredictable hot-headed narcissist buffoon was put in charge of the largest stockpile of nukes on the planet. California in one picture.  i like salty little bit .. but not as tears .. :( Thing I'm curious of and don't know the answer to, being from upside-down land: Would there be as much "told ya so", "salty" style rhetoric if the Dems did hang onto the Presidency?  hahaha making fun of how most of reddit is probably underweight and white. Good one you handsome devil You're damn right I'm salty. Holy fucking shit, I cannot wait for the use of "salt" in internet culture to die. Never in my life have a hated a slang-fad so fucking much. I have no idea why, it's the only one to ever irk me.

Now I have a trophy for originality for the first person who calls me salty; You just gotta come ~~let me beat you to death with it~~ claim it. How to protect yourself from ghosts: Surround yourself with reddit.  Lot more salt than that out there. If Brexit's anything to go by... this is Reddit for at least the next 4 years.  America today.... Twitter yes... Facebook, definitely... Tumblr, oh yes. 

Reddit? Nah, it's been relatively chill.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucUQuZEsCow stay salty fam. At least we broke the mold from a system of oppression. If you had about 100 more salt piles then itd be accurate This election was a mistake

~Sean Murray
 Is this the old Skyrim, rather than the SE? Only 3? Salt goes great on Trump Steaks. Well done with a side of ketchup please.  Only 3 Every media is salty. Voting follows MOBA rules, " If I can't play X,  I'm fucking up the game."  

 Salt pile

Weight 327 value 0 Never should have come here! Saw this in my highlighted posts all day, finally clicked. Have an upvote.  That salt pile is not large enough.  >Value: 2


Seems about right. I used to browse Reddit like you. Reddit every other day 💩💩💩💩 Ehhh, this is a C-tier shitpost, you could have at least photoshopped it so that the recipes said Trump catchphrases, or the quantity was the amount of votes Hillary got. Why is this bowl of shaving cream labeled salt pile (3)? Make Reddit Great Again +2 to strength, 15% increase in sensitivity  [deleted] Nah man, randomly combining 3 ingredients in the misc section is the way to go. [deleted] i eat all my own salt. are we talking about the same thing? Yea they're really only making things worse by dragging on and beating the freshly killed horse with vigour for real tho.  As an /r/movies mod we've been removing politcal shit all day. OMG Biff Tannen is president. Wow Idicoracy AMIRITEGUYS?! Not, gonna, happen.  'Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you. ' - Pericles, 430 BC  Exactly. Why is this even on here? It has nothing to do with gaming. It's clearly breaking the first rule of the sub. Or even worse, the new trend of making a new subreddit everyone trump or sanders farts.  R/shouldvebeensanders? For real? I mean I agree but that's  just  stupid  It's extremely annoying. Take a look at even r/wikipedia and the comments in their posts... it's fucking ridiculous. Then I got downvoted there for suggesting people keep their politics to political subs. What a joke. This is exactly what's ticking me off. I come here to talk about video games and laugh at the stupid shit that gets posted here. Not to talk about politics. I do enough of that already. It'll run it's due course  The never ending reposts and low quality posts on this sub had me half checked out, but this poor moderation is enough to unsub. Fuck you, faceless nationalist pig in support of women! My ideas are right! 

I felt like shit yesterday. Then I realized life goes on. Trump lies a lot and there's a very reasonable chance he said thing  he had no intention of following through with. Maybe he makes some common sense decisions and gets money out of politics. Gotta keep an open mind or else the next four (or eight) years will be painful.  Truth  I thought I could escape political discussion by playing some GTA Online. First thing I see when I enter a lobby was something like "so now that Trump's elected, is there gonna be a nuclear war?"

UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH How many of those celebs are actually going to leave?

[0](/spoiler) Why is it they never talk about moving to Mexico?
 I mean...you have a President who thinks Climate change is a conspiracy and may now potentially set back the global effort to minimise the effects of Climate change...

While the world won't end tomorrow, it ain't good for the world that he thinks that way. Oh man people on Facebook all need a Valium.  For me nothing beats the swarms of sore winners who care more about memes than maintaining the unity of a nation.  I know right.... Like fucking calm down, Trump is NOT Hitler, Trump wont euthanize all Black People, no there wont be WW3 (Btw how would there be WW3 with Trump ?? Like, he loves Putin, how) and no the world isnt gonna end. Trump is a lot of things and one of them is that he is Anti-Political Correctness, which appeals to A LOT of people today who are sick of this "opression culture" that has been going on for quite some time. So they voted and decided. Stop crying your eyes out and do something useful instead.

Edit: [With all the salt collected today, you could season every Lays Chips package for the next 2 decades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grD_IINiH9c)  Reddit seems a lot more civil than most other sites. Honestly my biggest surprise in all of this is that technology has advanced so much that touch screens still respond despite fingers being so covered in tears (source Miley Cyrus video). What a time to be alive. And your genitals could develop sores and become infected from being exposed to the salt.

Maybe that's just the Dead Sea. > (R) would OWN EVERYTHING

they will have the control of supreme court for the next 30 years(three SCOTUS are about to drop, they will put their own in), so you can imagine that nothing democrats do even if they win every election after trump will have any effect because they own supreme court now. Trump painted it all red... I'd rather they continue to gridlock than move the country backwards, like they claim to want. The will blame everything that goes wrong on Obama or some other scapegoat that is not a member of their party. 

Gas prices go up? It's the gays.

Unemployment skyrocketing? Not enough God in our schools.  Hahaha they will be pointing the finger at Obama for decades.  Everything that goes wrong will be Obama's fault, not Trump's.   Hell they blamed him for shit that happened before he became President, why wouldn't they blame him for shit after? They can do what Democrats did when they owned everything...

Not even defending Republican's. They were obstructionist as all hell and raped the filibuster.

I am just saying that partisanship is stupid. Depending on who you like, it is either the president's fault, Congress' fault, or the minority blocking the vote's fault.

Dems had congress and the presidency and they still didn't get much done so I don't see why it would be so insane if Republican's fared the same.

 nah, dude, they will have millions of excuses. the main will be that Obama left them in such a mess they can't clean it up. the media will certainly continue to veer strongly left (or the equivalent of what's considered left in this country, which is practically Ted Cruz authoritarian compared to most of the West) and that will be the main excuse why he fails, that everything is still rigged. with people who don't take personal responsibility for their actions, the system will always be rigged and the fault will always lie with the other side no matter who holds the cards. This was the same argument all the Republicans made when Obama took over with a Democratic house and Senate. How young are you? It already happened in 2002. Republican senate, house, supreme court, and president. Unless I'm just missing something.  Technically the Republicans don't own everything. Even though they won the senate, they didn't win by a large majority. This means that if they want to get anything done, they have to compromise with the Democrats. In trumps acceptance speech he said that he wanted the Americans to come together as one. Hopefully he truly means this and is ready to compromise.  Action Dan here. 

I voted D.

I voted A.


I voted AD.


I VOTED ACTION DAN! >the new Star Wars wasn't all that great

And you say you want to unite us.... You monster. Well said I agree. Seriously both sides are too extreme in their hatred of the other side. It's sad when lots of people are voting for a presidential candidate just to spite the other side.

Mind you, there's a difference in that we KNOW with Obama that the obstructionism was not just heated post-debate emotions. That literally became the platform of the Republican Party, to ensure Obama got as little done as possible, out of petty politics. We do not know yet if the Democratic side will prove as nasty this go-around, but I hope they don't. My concern is that we've now seen that obstructionism fucking works. That might be a bit challenging if my neighbors get exiled... People are so trendy, just give it a few weeks and everyone will go back to not giving a fuck for 4 more years. I would love it if this was true. But its not. Just today my stepdad was nonchalantly talking about gay conversion therapy as a good thing on MY facebook. I am openly bisexual. This shit hurts. Other people are saying hurtful things constantly as well. (Second example type stuff) I don't even want to be on facebook right now. I am watching all my friends become hateful bigoted people and watching those who wanted hillary to win tremble in fear and be overcome with depression. We can't all go back to being neighbors anymore. Cat's out of the bag. Its not just reddit, its people. The election doesn't change opinions though, nor should it.  If Hillary won, I wouldn't expect people to not hate her or to reexamine their beliefs until they receive new evidence.

If Trump does a good job I will change my opinion.  Until he gets a chance, I am going to continue to believe that electing him was a mistake.  We shall see... The scary part is that many people in real life, probably people you're even close with, think the exact same way. They just have a filter and will avoid talking politics. 

And this is both sides of the fence and is quite shocking to hear someone say something completely wrong or boneheaded regarding the election and then want to drop it when you try to discuss WTF they just said. It doesn't matter if you even do seem to convince them - their minds are made and have been made for a long time. [A miserable little pile of secrets.](http://i.imgur.com/qY8en.jpg) [I got you, fam](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/man) Water, 35 liters; carbon, 20 kilograms; ammonia, 4 liters; lime, 1.5 kilograms; phosphorus, 800 grams; salt, 250 grams; saltpeter, 100 grams; sulfur, 80 grams; fluorine, 7.5; iron, 5; silicon, 3 grams; and trace amounts of 15 other elements.

"Four" - /u/mastertwin2 Airplanes emerged from two huge buildings and thousands of people sprang to life? 9/11 was yesterday in a great deal of the world outside of the USA. True story. Do you have windows 10? There's a tablet service enabled on 10 that causes consistent crashing. Usually between 10-20 minutes the game crashes to desktop. I've forgotten which one it is but a quick google search shoukd provide the answer. My friend had crashes evey 15 minutes but disabling the service fixed it for him.

Apologies for errors im on mobile and the loser along with her supporters laughed at him and said he was ridiculous for calling it rigged O R C I S H    M A C E Figures a Hilary supporter wouldn't know a orcish mace from Molag Bal That's just an orcish mace Wow,racist much? Orc lives matter,bruh. I'll get downvoted for saying this, as did everyone else, but that's an orcish mace. At least you tried, though! Thats a plain ole orcish mace, not the mace of Molag Bol. That is an orcish mace, [this](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mace_of_Molag_Bal) is the mace of Molag Bal Lmfao that's an orchish mace idiot Low effort high energy? I haven't kept up with these memes [deleted] Easy, the DNC pushed a candidate which few wanted. Resulting in the popular candidate (bernie) being pushed aside... this obviously didn't sit well with Alot of people, so while all the media (including reddit) was pro Clinton, enough Americans obviously thought trump was the lesser of two evils and thus chose the candidate not supported by the establishment.

What will happen next, who knows. Basically, people are tired of being called racist and stupid so they decided to give politics the biggest middle finger they could find. The media should have been more honest and respectful. You can't insult half the nation and expect them to vote for your candidate. Careful, he's  vindictive, very petty and known to use the courts to get back at his enemies. The orange demon now controls the department of Justice.  You're acting like he alone could shoot off a nuke. It's a process. You probably could have looked [this](http://kingofwallpapers.com/california/california-005.jpg) up yourself but that's okay No. Arrow to the knee by any chance?  Because real men use salt. Looks at Mr. Fancy discovering two ingredients at a time. Don't blow too quickly. Fuck you that's not skyrim Y... you didn't know about sprinting? How long did your first playthrough take at jogging speed? You know about fast travel, right? The last one is forgivable. Previous TES games didn't have sprint. Fast walking was as good as it got.  Lol same here. Took until level 35~ I was like HOLY SHIT  You can sprint in this game. 

Every time I pissed off a troll.. well you can imagine what happened.  ...is he happy or is that the horror of what he's done sinking in? legit looked like me laughing at seeing CNN lose their shit. Until you realize that you are still poor and uneducated, and some billionaire with an orange face and tiny hands won't do anything to change that. As a liberal who supported Hillary for this election, I can't stop laughing at this. Well done, Trump guys.

I'm also Turkish and 30 and have seen, "won", and "lost" so many general elections that the huge loss yesterday doesn't faze me very much, so I actually do enjoy the mega butthurt-ness from people on my side... and of course the **SOARING MEME MARKET**. [Being a pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, pro-gun, pro-prettymucheverycivilliberty, nonreligious, climate change concerned dude on reddit today](https://i.imgur.com/uZAaGs0.jpg) I think Reddit is better when it loses. More crazy shit. You mean like Harambe? I'd take an arrow to the knee any day at this point Not enough people will say it, but really, thank you. I just left my dnd game, and it is crazy how people won't shut up about it. I'm just like "I want to get drunk and pretend I'm a dwarf" and nobody seems to want to respect that. 

Seriously, I raised a glass to cheers that the political adds would end after the election night was over. Little did I know it would get worse. 

Anyways, I'm done ranting. Thank you for trying to keep one of the places I go safe from that  Thank you, for real.  Oh, I have an interest. And I go to political subreddits for that. If I'm in a gaming subreddit, I don't need attempted political memes because they happened to find a game screenshot that matched. This was not a gaming post. It seems game screenshot trumps all...  Clearly you have had too much salt True, but my Reddit addiction won't let me stay away for that long. Right? It's finally over. Let's do something else, already. The same number that left both times Obama won, basically. Amy schumer better leave, I think we all can agree on that 0 Their egos are just bruised because they don't have the influence they thought they did. Woooo.  Use of the new spoiler tag.   Celebs are fully aware what their addiction to nose candy has done to that country but definitely do not want to face the results of their actions ever.  I'd live in Cancun in a heartbeat. And can afford to with the plummeting value of the peso.. shit, I voted for Trump/am happy to see him win but now I'm thinking Mexico sounds pretty legit anyway.  Nobody wants to live there, especially Mexicans We can only hope when they do their "this is actually how shit works" talk with him, his views will normalize. Don't forget he thinks its a hoax perpetrated by **China**! Do you know how much China has to spend reducing its co2 emissions? Why would a government fabricate a hoax that is not even remotely in their interest?  "Climate change" ***is*** a hoax, perpetrated by Canada.  Canadian maple syrup generators run on snow and ice, and so Canada is trying to fool us all into cooling the entire planet down.  The mainstream media isn't even covering this.   yeah lol they are all smug now but they will join us in crying in a few years.

 Not only is he going to reverse our current climate change policies, but he also intends to ramp up our use and production of domestic fossil fuels in the name of creating jobs. Lmao, some chick actually posted about needing to pickup daily Xanax consumption. Nothing shows more political maturity than shitposting memes and bragging that your shit candidate best the other shit candidate. seriously. So many people are gloating and it just shows they know how shit Trump is. If he was really good for America as a whole, i wouldn't see so many self-indulgent posts about how the "salty liberals" lost and how much everything is going to suck for them. Because if Trump wasn't awful for America, things wouldn't end up sucking, and they know things are gonna get a lot worse before they get better.

Basically, this sore winner attitude is just more evidence that they have no illusions about Trump making America "great" in any capacity.  The WW3 talk comes from the fact that he asked three times why we couldn't use nukes. Regardless of political affiliation that is frightening. Just to mention it since you asked; trump stated that he wouldn't hesitate to blow Iranian ships out of the water for making rude gestures at American ships.  He then later doubled down on this, and insisted that doing such a thing would not start a war.  I think stuff like that would be where people get he idea that trump might start ww3. 

Edit:  huh yeah turns out it wasn't as crazy as it was made out to sound.  My b, yo  Man what you people don't get is that Trump isn't what we are scared of.

What we're scared of is what happens when you put someone who doesn't know what they're doing and who is easily manipulated into the office of the President. George W. Bush is the most recent example of the result. You get politically savvy people manipulating that person to do their will. You get a war we didn't want, need, or have any justification for so that the people who run Halliburton can get rich. So that the military-industrial complex can pump up production and make money.

Trump isn't going to do shit, but he's going to be the figurehead, the wall behind which worse people hide, while they do things. These people now have a buffoon to absorb the blame, the fallout, and the backlash while they do whatever they want. This is exactly what happened to W. and it is exactly what is going to happen this time.

And even if I'm wrong about all of that, even if Trump is a fucking genius and totally mentally stable and competent and capable of handling all of this for the next four years, we still have a DEEPLY red house and senate now and at least one, and possibly several, Supreme Court seats to fill.

We are going to have a conservative Supreme Court for GENERATIONS now. All these reddit kids and anarchists who think this is funny or "not a big deal" don't realize what that means. So since we're in /r/gaming lets take JUST gaming and apply a simple bit of history. Multiple times in our countries recent history someone has tried to ban video games for their content and those attempts have been blocked by court rulings that games are protected under free speech. How many of you think your deep red grandparents who voted for Trump agree with that? 

**How many of you think deep red Conservative Republicans look at Grand Theft Auto V and think "Yes, this is free speech."?**

We are going to get Republican appointed federal judges, republican appointed supreme court judges, and not just REPUBLICAN but fucking Tea Party conservative nutbag republican.

This isn't a fucking joke. Are we all going to die a horrible fiery death in WW3? No. But that doesn't mean everything is going to be fine. A whole bunch of shit is very much NOT going to be fine. The man stated he would combat ISIS by ordering the military to commit war crimes by intentionally killing the terrorists families. I get that he's not Hitler, and you're absolutely correct if your point is that political parties historically overstate their opponents faults, but this is the only time in my lifetime that a candidate deserved legitimate general concern over his being elected. Pretty sure Hillary won the Popular vote, but yeah the election ended and there's no point in whining about the results, just accept it and move on. WW3 doesn't have to involve the US.  WWI and WWII were global conflicts long before the US got involved.  Trump is basically signalling to Russia and China that he agrees with their policy of using military might to extract concessions from one's neighbors.  He himself wants to do this with our allies.  He has already expressed little interest in defending our allies, whether in Europe or East Asia.  He wants to essentially eliminate global trade.  All of these things raise the risk of global conflict, such as between Russia and Eastern Europe or China and the rest of East Asia. > Btw how would there be WW3 with Trump ?? Like, he loves Putin, how

Probably won't result in WWIII but the danger of Putin and Trumps friendship can go: Trump and Putin get buddy buddy, Trump removes sanctions on Russia, Russian then goes wild in Eastern Europe. I can't tell if this post is satire or not. It makes sense why people would be upset that Trump is president. People of Mexican descent who may be deported or have their family broken up despite living in the country for many years for one example. 

Trump is also a climate change denier so anyone who lives in earth will be negatively damaged and we will be set back many years in our efforts to minimize the effects of climate change.

His economic policies were determined by many economists to increase our debt Tremendously and widen the wealth gap between rich and poor. 

His ascendancy will encourage bigots and misogynists everywhere that it is ok to disrespect and attack other people for gender or race. Our children will grow up with this narcisstic Bully as their role model.

 Other white supremacists in European Nations may be inspired by trump and take power.

Trump won't start ww3(probably) but he poses a massive risk to minorities especially but also everyone else on the planet and our fears are justified. That is not "salt". 

Alternatively, if Hilary was elected nobody would be fearing for their lives.  You may not like her, but she isn't dangerous like trump. The racial slurs came out on my facebook feed the last few days. It was disappointing, but not surprising when I saw who was saying that shit. So much this. Don't think I've ever been called a massive cuck and/or a cis gendered asshole as much as I have been today on other sites.

Gotta love how reddit is both rational and empathetic. At least on reddit the people calling me an asshole, racist, homophic shitlord aren't related to me It's cause it is being surprisingly civil. Few jokes here or there, but you know how bragging goes... It's not enough to win, you have to make the others seem like idiots for not winning with you. Seems pretty childish. I know, that's the craziest part.  Even as much vitriol as has been thrown around (and I'm ashamed to admit I was one of those people, too), it's still a fuck of a lot more civil than anything on Facebook.

People rip into each other over a Tasty recipe that "isn't actually Italian," on Facebook.  When you get religion or politics into the mix... jesus wept. Yeah Tumblrs a shitshow  Yeah, this election is going to be reverberating for a long time even if he's a 1 term president  clinton painted it red Jesus Christ.  We've been through this exact scenario before and that's why we have the current problems we have now.  What you are describing ISN'T a good thing.  It's making our problems WORSE.  And they all got mad at Obama for wanting to put someone in in his last year I blame Ubisoft. I'm sure this is their fault.  Honest question...

If it turns out Republicans improve life for Americans across the board, would that change your opinion at all regarding Trump and the Republican party? Nah man we gays are responsible for natural disasters, get it right. And Obama blamed everything on Bush, and Bush blamed Clinton, and Clinton blamed Bush.  This is nothing new. And they didn't do that to Bush? I still hear people blame everything on him.  I mean,  they can SAY that,  but it's not true.   Though,  I guess this election taught me that facts don't matter at all.   > (or the equivalent of what's considered left in this country, which is practically Ted Cruz authoritarian compared to most of the West)

European checking in.

Don't worry. Just wait for the French and German elections that are coming in a little time, Europe will join you in the full right-wing direction.  That's where I draw the fucking line. So I guess it's ruined people for me. That's just a sad state of facts Republicans now own everything. It's their opportunity to do what they believe is right for the country. Regardless there will be people who don't agree with what is right, but I sure hope some good comes of this. My biggest concern is that there were Republicans who were against Trump and I hope there is not division within the party that prevents some type of progress. 

Only time will tell if he was the right choice but there are plenty of people who are like me that felt that Clinton would be the status quo and there would not be much progress or change. 

Like all presidents they make big promises when running and are unfortunately unable to deliver those promises for a multitude of reasons, but we can only hope that Trump and party leaders can come together and "make deals". \*glass shattering* Comments like yours are great because of what you see in your head as you read them. Yes, I do and I use tablet mode all the time when remoting. Thanks for the tip! That's the joke, it's a play on the fact he kept harping abou how it was rigged yet clearly he never believed it since he actually won and never brought it up. Fucking milkdrinkers Figures they can't spell Molag *Bal* either Macist af [Orc Lives Matter](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/6e/e6/90/6ee69036ea076601a9bfa65fe8bd680e.jpg) gave you an upvote for keeping it real What a fucking casual They will actually be less salty - more water from melting glaciers will dilute the salt concentration I love how people keep saying Bernie was the popular vote, but the reality is he was only popular among millennials. Being on Reddit, you're essentially in a giant echo chamber where everyone says Bernie was the best. Funny thing about Reddit though, [its main demographic is...](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/reddit-demographics-in-one-chart/277513/)

You can argue about polls as well, saying Bernie was ahead of Trump. So was Hillary. Many Trump supporters either A) Weren't polled or B) Lied to avoid retaliation.

Bernie wouldn't have won regardless. The thing that frightens me is that so many people didn't think Trump was the lesser of two evils, but that he is the best possible candidate. His supporters are ENTHUSIASTICALLY pro Trump, whereas a lot of support for Hillary was tepid acceptance that at least she isn't Trump. That's he only reason I supported her.  Ok, so, I totally get where you're coming from there. Nobody likes to be called stupid or racist. But, it kinda seems like an 'if the shoe fits' kinda situation at this point, you know? Or at least a really toxic self-fulfilling cycle.

Trump supporters are tired of born-rich, city-dwelling liberal elites fucking with their jobs and calling them stupid and racist. So, naturally, it seems like a great idea to *elect* a born-rich, city-dwelling, formerly liberal elite who has a track record of fucking with jobs and education and says racist things? It's... honestly a little bit hard to sympathize with that. Yeah you  guys really got 'em. Hopefully everything doesn't get too fucked in this country. When your alchemy skill is this high? Skooma ain't the only thing you're interested in.  Take it with a grain of salt. [deleted] Some say he's still jogging to this day. You can jog? I'm always overencumbered! True dragonborns don't fast travel. Yes [Yes](http://e.lvme.me/356wuzl.jpg)  Hey, it's not Trump, it's Hillary Clinton that has failed in every conceivable metric against what should have been the world's lousiest political opponent. Had this contest been between Bernie and Trump, Bernie would have won hands down. Americas political process perhaps should be investigated, as well as the political parties that have clearly colluded to ensure the weakest possible opponent (Hillary) was allowed to even run given her criminal issues Yes. I'm a Bernie supporter and was doing the same thing. Now I get to sit back and say "I told you so" for the next 4 years. It's gonna be great aside from the constant looming dread. Same CNN should be on par with E News.  

They had a round table a year ago and the only person to say Trump could def win was the black man (I know that is really helpful), they all laughed out loud at him like "oh haha, okay sure go ahead and explain how he could win".  He was dead serious.  East coast liberals just didn't get it.   So fucking smug. Honestly Obama didn't change much either, but we as liberals were just as ecstatic to elect him a second time. It's more about your side winning vs. losing than actual benefits. Well I'm upper middle class and well educated; hilarious though that your divisive insulting manner is exactly what drove many people to vote for 'some billionaire with an orange face and tiny hands.'  Must sting pretty hard, eh?

Oh wait, that would require you to actually do some self reflection and realize that you are the evil you think you stand against. Yeah, keep insulting their demographic, that worked out really well over the last 18 months! Meme market went up 300 points. Someone earlier today was making a jab at people who "can't stop mourning an ape after 6 months". I mean, how insensitive and rude. dicks right out Dicks out. Chuck?   He might be quoting civ 6! Since Pericles is in the game and it's a quote when you discover a specific civic.  or anything with front page potential. It's all about them eyeballs. Shit every election I can remember has those people saying they're gonna leave. Never do Actually, since around 2010, each year has been a record for Americans renouncing their citizenship. And Lena Dunham Some hate trump some hate Hilary but everything he hates Amy schumer  Well we're sad to say that Katie Hopkins is coming your way. So... good luck with that.


*leaves into a room from which partying is audible* She just said she's not leaving, and it's sexist for you to expect her to. Somehow. We're gonna build a wall. Women are smart and funny! Hey women are smart and funny, get over it and let's come together as a couuuntry  Wouldn't Canada consider this an act of war? Spoiler alert, you heathen! My drug of choice comes from China.  One can only hope - but I don't *think* the Republican Party is big on the effort either, and they'd be the ones giving him the talkin too. 

Although I do admit, I don't know that much about the Party...

I know the VP is super religious, so doubt Trump will get a climate change talking too there (judging from the religious in Britain) The intelligence cabal runs the country. A few of their handlers will brief Trump, and he will fall in line.
   The problem is that it's not just Trump that must be convinced.  Remember that we have a freshly refurbished GOP-dominated Congress now, and Pence absolutely *is* a typical Republican.

Even if they convince Trump that climate change is serious and real, the GOP's official stance is that it's not - and *they're* the ones that will ultimately have to sign off on any bills. His own stupid resorts are being threatened by climate change. If he ups the pace of melting, he's gonna lose money as everything goes under water. 

He may not be smart enough to understand that, but someone running his businesses is because they already started enacting mitigation measures.  That's because it's too controversial, you only see the truth in places like this. Everyone else is to afraid to even broach the subject. ^/s (clearly) That is what pisses me off. I did not want Trump but he did it and i hope he proves me wrong. Yet someone waited until today to reply to an old comment of mine to say Hillary lost and to suck it. 

Wow. Hillary won the popular vote but they were close. Yep, brag in my face as you have to face others that think the same. Have you somehow missed every election ever? The gloating is one of the few things that is consistent. They don't think things are going to suck for them, they think things are going to suck for the people they don't like and get better for people like them. Perhaps this is a reaction to those that thought Hillary would win in a landslide Reddit is so salty that [we're gonna put a lot of salt miners out of business](https://youtu.be/ksIXqxpQNt0?t=10) 😂 Yes, his comments regarding nukes and foreign policy if acted upon could easily be a precursor to WWIII. It's not like he is going to fire the first shot or anything, but if we start withdrawing our troops from around the world that by their very presence maintain stability or demanding payment for them, then destabilization can happen. Destabilization leads to bad things. Hopefully the generals will stop him, now that the public has failed. Link please. I'd like to see the source. I looked into this out of curiosity, and it turns out it's not as unreasonable with context. He was referring to this incident: http://www.mediaite.com/online/new-video-shows-iranian-revolutionary-guards-high-speed-intercept-of-u-s-destroyer/

>The Navy said the destroyer attempted radio communications 12 times with the Iranian ships and was ignored. A Navy official said that the Iranians’ actions were “unsafe and unprofessional,” and that the ships “created a dangerous, harassing situation that could have led to further escalation.”

I still think he sounded too bellicose by saying they'll be shot (isn't that the Navy's call?), but the Iranian ships were creating a dangerous situation.  Yeah, I mean imagine Turkey shot down a Russia jet and the pilots were torn apart there would be instant war, wouldn't there.  Hillary Clinton said 18 government intelligence services confirmed that Russia hacked Podestas emails, and that it should be considered an act of war. I don't know how liberals have gotten this idea in their crazy heads that "Trump is a 'KGB' plant, but he's also going to start WW3, with Russia." while maintaining the thought that "Hillary will ensure peace by threatening Russia with a no-fly zone over Syria, continuing to arm Jihadists in the Middle East, and consider the hack that Russia had no part in an act of war." Shit, if you guys could do half the gymnastics you do mentally, you'd all get a trophy at the Special Olympics. And also because looking back at History, nothing good has ever come from a populist vote. It's the sort of rhetoric and political movements that started both world wars. 

Trump's not the issue, it's his uneducated voters. Oh, but didn't you hear, political correctness on tumblr is such a huge fucking problem in the world right now, so the only logical choice is to elect a gas balloon for president. /s This. Fucking preach. > So since we're in /r/gaming lets take JUST gaming and apply a simple bit of history. Multiple times in our countries recent history someone has tried to ban video games for their content and those attempts have been blocked by court rulings that games are protected under free speech. How many of you think your deep red grandparents who voted for Trump agree with that?
> 
> How many of you think deep red Conservative Republicans look at Grand Theft Auto V and think "Yes, this is free speech."?

The most important conservative jurist of the past 50 years was Justice Scalia. It's not hard to look up his views on whether games are protected speech:

http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-scalia-saved-video-games/

>In his opinion, Scalia argued that, as an expressive medium, games should fall under the same protections that the First Amendment grants to other types of creative speech:

>Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas — and even social messages — through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player’s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection. Under our Constitution, “esthetic and moral judgments about art and literature … are for the individual to make, not for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority.”

>Depictions of violence, Justice Scalia added, have never been subject to government regulation. “Grimm’s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim indeed,” he wrote, recounting the gory plots of “Snow White,” “Cinderella” and “Hansel and Gretel.” High school reading lists and Saturday morning cartoons, too, he said, are riddled with violence.




 I have a few friends in Taiwan.  They're rather nervous right now. Europe fights back. America stays out as long as possible, because Trump is an isolationist. Finally, we reluctantly enter the war. Nukes, nukes, nukes, Preston says another settlement needs your help.  I haven't seen racial slurs in my group of friends, but I've seen more _____-ist name calling than I ever have before.  I'm seeing a lot of Black people blaming white people on twitter. It's a shame. Keep in mind that we haven't had a one term president for 24 years.  Unless we kill the justices he puts in after he leaves.   The DNC let her. Turns out you can't cherry pick candidates the people don't want.  They work together ironically well. Clinton and the DNC. 

As a European, I've learned a lot from this election. Like how two parties make a democracy, how Democrats are the more manipulative group, that electoral votes are somehow fair and legal, and that there is such a thing as the DNC.  democrats never had the control of supreme court for a straight 30 years, republicans will, along with having control over few other things too

all these liberals crying are not overacting one bit, they just understand how fucked they are... This. It's sad people are more excited to stick it to another party than to have a good government. I blame Comcast. I personally blame EA. Titanfall 2, despite critical acclaim, will probably suffer its predecessor's fate because it was launched so close to BF1. Unlike narrative EA is trying to convince itself is reality, they do not appeal to different swaths of the market and most of their target audience already dropped at least $60 on BF1 a month ago. Long story short, EA is flooding the market and our economy will likely topple as a result.  
  
 100% yes. I welcome that challenge and hope that a great deal of my personal ethos will be proven wrong. 

I highly doubt that will happen, but yes. That would dramatically shift my worldview of conservative economics and the Republican party in general.  If trump turns out to be a good president and say doesn't fuck over civil liberties or eh benefit of doubt say 50% of the metrics we use to show improvement or progress. 

I'll vote republican from this point on. 

I don't think it will be trump though. That's a pretty safe bet. All the jobs and what not he promises don't exist because well they got shipped over seas and technology and automation replaced them. 

They aren't coming back. Burning more coal isn't going to help that either.  If Trump can somehow make everything better, I'll eat my words.

But the thing is, on pretty much EVERY social issue, I disagree with him.

If he turns around and says "Eh I was too hard on the Mexicans and the Syrians", I'll acknowledge it.

If he says "You know what? I should tell women what to do with their birth control", I'll acknowledge it.

If he says "The fuck do I care about gays? Go crazy", then I'll acknowledge it.

The thing is he built his ENTIRE platform going AGAINST those things. And looking at his past management history (ALL the bankruptcies and failed businesses) I have no reason to believe he can run a lemonade stand, let alone a country.

So what I'm saying is that if the Republicans reverse their stances on pretty much everything then I'll be okay. Depends on how much improvement. We are already doing kinda ok I don't want them riding the coat tails and then throwing a party.  If they overturn the ruling on gay marriage, etc. like Pence wants to, they can't improve the lives of people across the boards. A lot of the issues are subjective and opinion based. 

(Unlikely) Example: he builds the wall, immigration plummets. Some people will be upset because of the waste of money spent on a wall and they don't mind even illegal immigration as long as the immigrants aren't violent, and some will be happy because they don't like illegal immigration. 

So improving life for Americans "across the board" is gonna be nearly impossible. 

Side note: as someone who really, really hates Trump, I do like the idea of putting ourselves first and rebuilding our infrastructure, but my biggest problem is figuring out how to pay for all the things he wants to do when he wants such a massive tax cut. 
 It would definitely change my opinion because they would have to do everything differently than they said they would.  To be fair,  I'm not sure there's much Trump can do to change my opinion about him since he's been pretty clear about who he is,  but despite being super liberal,  I've never had a problem with the way Republicans want to govern.   It's their pandering to alt right hate groups that pisses me off.   Not that guy, but sure. But improvements "across the board" is pretty much an impossible feat for any party.

I'm pretty skeptical though. Congress, the senate, Trump, and possibly his Supreme Court nominees would all have to go against their party platform on social issues for me and a lot of other people. 

Also healthcare is a big one for me because my genes are utter shit. ACA has a lot of problems but if the pre-existing conditions clause goes away I may as well just go buy a gun and get things over with quickly. Depends on what "improve life" means to you. If the economy starts improving, great, cool, I think everyone will be happy with that. At the same time, though, there are issues like climate change, gun control, LGBT rights, and the legalization of marijuana to worry about, and no matter how you address the issue, someone won't be happy. The problems I see:  Try to overturn gay marriage, overturn Roe V. Wade, defund Planned Parenthood, push abstinence only programs, stand by Citizens United, cut Education spending, deregulate everything, overturn the ACA, have a hyper-conservative Supreme Court, continue to pretend that climate change is a hoax and scientists are paid shills, deny science in general, isolationist policies, possible trade war with China.

These are just the problems I can forsee off the top of my head.  Maybe they'll center out, but I've been thinking Donald was going to center out this whole election, but he just kept moving further right.  I don't see why he would stop now if it brought him to success. It'll be hard to have an opinion when you're too busy fleeing the coast from yet another Ultra-Hurricane caused by that 'Chinese hoax', climate change. yeah, i mean trump said a lot that wasn't true, now he's president elect...i personally would much rather win than be correct, i wish my team would figure that out. But enough talk! Have at you! Could you rephrase that please? Meridia's Beacon 2020! Bernie would have been demolished, reddit is stupid if they think the country that voted in trump would have instead voted in the Jewish socialist from VT who has done nothing his entire like except be a politician in New England. Well your right there. Reddit is basically a giant echo chamber in which any oppinion which differes from the majority is shut down. To be honest it's quite sad, I think the vote would have gone a far different angle if each side tried to understand the issues of the other instead of name calling  e.g. racist, sexism,  corrupt, war monger  ect  Bernie's campaign suffered from targeting millennials (and particularly college-bound millennials who would be extra receptive to his claims of abolishing student loan debt) almost exclusively.  Clinton's campaign recognized his weakness at reaching out to minorities and other groups and capitalized on it. Yeah. You can't paint this as trump being elected to prove people aren't racist. That's exactly the opposite of how it works.

A Democrat doesn't vote for Democrats so the Republicans will stop calling them Democrats. > Yeah you guys really got 'em.

That's the exact attitude he's talking about.  Walter the White is suffering from a rare Daedric curse, so now in order to provide for his family he teams up with a former apprentice to create that next level skooma. With the Skooma Overhaul mod, its actually worth finding and taking  I sold my soul for moon sugar. And eat their fucking faces off Well, I learned I could sprint once I had my character level 60. I noticed in a YouTube video someone sprinting and thought it was a mod. Then I checked controls. Felt pretty dumb  We couldn't trust polls that projected a huge Clinton win but can *certainly* trust polls that suggested that Bernie could have done well.


makes perfect sense Idk. I was a Bernie supporter too, but I'd still prefer Hillary because she's predictable. If trump couldn't be trusted with Twitter, then why would we trust him with foreign policy? It's weird, I'm more motivated to put a Bernie sticker on my car now than I was back when I voted for him. He got a lot done considering he got crapped on by the senate and house for most of his 2 terms. Democrats literally just lost all federal level power. Trump is entering the White House with the Supreme Court, and both houses aligned to him. So he can change a LOT of shit if he feels like it. It's pretty hard to change anything when partisan politics are out to fuck you no matter what you table. > Honestly Obama didn't change much either

That's because everything that people want to change is the job of Congress and not the president. [deleted] I mean you really think about it. Even look at housing prices in Canada. Buuuuuuut then you realize it's going to be a lot of hassle to emigrate and that half the rhetoric was just rhetoric and you probably won't be stripped of your civil liberties so may as well stick around and giggle as the other team blunders around trying to fix things that weren't really broken to you but were catastrophic to them. Plus Canada is cold and you being from the South you run for your fluffy robe and jammys when it hits 55 degrees outside. She's the one who molested her sister isn't she? Aka Sister Fister You keep both of them the hell out of Canada! We don't want them! So I heard she wants to move to Vancouver, which is kind of fitting in that that city has crazy rent/purchase prices for condos, houses etc. because of foreign millionaires buying up property there. Anyway, I think it's sort of ironic considering the character she plays on her own show. AND TAKE HER SISTER'S PUSSY PEBBLES WITH HER! Except Hollywood. I feel like they keep trying to force her down our throats. She's too full of shite to actually do it. Would bloody love it though. Most likely. But they sent us Bieber and many other morons, so we'll call it even Big tea drinker? Poppies! China white? >the Republican Party is big on the effort either, and they'd be the ones giving him the talkin too.

It won't be the Republican party giving him the talking too it will be the heads of all the alphabet agency like the NSA, FBI, CIA etc. as well as military brass. If you watched Paul Ryan's speech today, you'd know, not think.

We're firing up coal and oil and getting people back to work and not let big government like the EPA get in the way. Which is weird since the pope seems to be taking climate change seriously. Oh, Pence believes that homosexuality can - and should - be cured with conversion therapy. 

Congrats, everybody, the American Taliban is now running the country.  "If you do this the CIA will poison you, if you that the Secret Service will crash your airplane if you do the other the aliens will vaporize you". Reddit is composed of both sore winners and sore losers. Today was the worst day for Reddit in years. The only good part is that /r/politics has stopped all the paid/sponsored content and has ceased to become an absolute echo chamber. oh my god, that happened to me last night too. Someone replied to an earler post of mine after i disabled inbox replies because the conversation was getting nowhere. 

I pointed out how sad it was his first reaction was to brag about it to some stranger who disagreed with him on the internet, and then blocked him.  yeah, and I'm not a fan of it either way. For what its worth, i don't remember this much gloating for Obama, but then i wasn't on Reddit at the time.

edit: i don't expect I'll be believed, but if Clinton had won I wouldn't have felt compelled to spend my day rubbing it in the faces of unhappy internet strangers. Basically. Either way, its a pretty telling reaction.  > It's not like he is going to fire the first shot or anything,

Have you actually looked at the man you are talking about? This is the same manchild that had to have his twitter privileges taken away from him by his campaign staff because they couldn't actually get him to control himself and not make an ass of himself on it, and who regularly goes on week long tirades against anyone that insults him.

That manchild can nuke people in about two months.

 But I thought he knows more than the generals /s Here's the problem. He'll have nuke codes. He'll also have 100% authority to use them and if the "generals" don't comply, they go to jail. If he orders a launch, they are required by law to comply with his order. http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/03/trump-asks-why-us-cant-use-nukes-msnbcs-joe-scarborough-reports.html Once again the fear mongerers are proved wrong, hopefully those Iranian ships can take salt water well.  He may not be THE issue, but he is definitely an issue. "I am so smart, and everyone who did not vote for the person I voted for is not" 

You are more of a smug little shit than  martin shkreli Justice Scalia was an exceptional Jurist. Lets hope any and all Supreme Court appointees are as well chosen.

But I can god damn guarantee you that lower level federal courts will not be filled with such brilliant minds. There aren't enough of them for one thing.

We're going to get a LOT of deeply partisan appointments in a country where a lot of people are already feeling disenfranchised. Whether you like it or not this country is at its best when both sides are represented and serve to keep each other in check. That balances has been destroyed and there's a very good chance that things are going to tilt in a bad direction now.
 My stepdad openly said on my facebook that all people need are the right treatment and they will be okay. He was talking about gay conversion therapy and praying the gay away. He knows I am bisexual and have many gay friends. I had to delete his comment it upset me so much. There is a reason I don't talk to them. Right? Since when do blacks blame all their problems on whites?  Yeah..... :/ r/youreonalist But Hillary won the popular. She beat him in numbers, just not the right numbers. You can't say people "don't want" her when she won the popular vote. >  Democrats are the more manipulative group

As someone who leans right... BARELY.  They're both so stuck in their love for power.  That's the real problem. > that electoral votes are somehow fair and legal

Four years ago, Trump tweeted that the electoral college was the biggest threat to democracy.

This year, it's the only reason he's in office. If we abolished it between then and now, Hillary would've won. Electoral votes are legal, undeniably. Thankfully so, or rural areas would be ignored completely. >two parties make a democracy


It's ridiculous, isn't it? We are a democracy "for show", basically. It's disgusting and it will need to change within the next 20-30 years or the consequences will be dire for the government. There could be riots on the streets. They understand how fucked *everyone* is. yep fucking comcast thats always a safe bet There's enough blame to go around for both, don't worry.  Titanfall is made by Respawn Entertainment, and is "only" published by EA.

Battlefield 1 is made by EA Dice, and It is Published by EA. 

They are two different competing companies using the same Publisher. Tf2 definitely has its share of flaws, but even with them I'd say it's still a solid 8/10 performer and I greatly respect Respawn's intentions to avoid filling their game with microtransactions.

The economy won't topple as long as we keep buying supply chests in COD, though!  Activision will save us all. when did he say he was against gays?


hint: never
 I thought he wasn't anti-gay, didn't he hold a LGBT flag recently? Also, how is keeping illegal Mexican immigrants out being too harsh? He isn't against legal immigrants, his wife is one. Good answer,  right?  I mean,  the Democrats turned the economy around and saved us from almost certain economic collapse.   I have a hard time believing the Republicans can actually improve things much.   Despite what people seem to believe,  things are actually pretty good now.  But if they did somehow manage to make the US a utopia,  I'd have to admit that they're doing something right.  That said.... It's never worked before.   The wall will never be built. Also, Pence may or may not be more terrifying considering he wants to defund HIV research and put money into gay conversion therapy.

 For the sake of argument, he could start down the road Libertarians want, and start pulling back American forces from overseas which would drop defense spending which could be pivoted right into Infrastructure. Not to mention if Obamacare gets repealed it could be argued that we go back down to earlier levels of health spending, which basically doubled at least in last years budget versus the average. Kick that towards Infrastructure and suddenly we got a good 15% of our national budget going towards rebuilding roads and bridges. Comments with intense imagery are great.  gamily? Alchemy bitch! Wouldn't he be making blue Moon Sugar? Daedric Mad [Say my name.](https://d21ii91i3y6o6h.cloudfront.net/gallery_images/from_proof/1633/large/1405433582/heisencat.png) What does the mod do? I can only imagine the amount of ice spikes that hit you. Don't worry man, my first playthrough of RE4 was done entirely without the use of running. You can imagine my face when i found out... The problem was that the polls were  right. Even 538's polls showed Clinton up for a good while. Then Nate Silver seemed to eschew his own polling.

Among likely Democrat voters, Clinton would have won. The problem is that likely Democrats didn't vote. They didn't vote for Trump, Stein, Johnson, or Clinton. They simply didn't vote. Except that the polls around that same time weren't showing Clinton leading by nearly the same margin. In fact, there were a few that were even showing Clinton *down* by 1-2 points on Trump. Meanwhile, Bernie was sitting there with, on average, a 10-12 point lead on Trump. my staunch republican dad said he would have voted for bernie, so i believe it. I don't. And I did prefer Hillary. I just think it's going to be fun watching the establishment Democrats scratch their heads for the next 4 years wondering why we didn't all just fall in line behind their shitty, corrupt candidate. Was Hil-dawg predictable?  Did you predict she'd be investigated by the FBI twice?  Sanders was predictable.  Democrats chose a raging dumpster fire. LOL yeah, it's true. Just to show "at least I voted for the right guy, can't blame me" to the rest of the world. Eh, it was only half purposeful, haha. The word will never be the same. The Trump pun? I saw, I upvoted. I couldn't let it end on that though considering what we were arguing about in the first place. Plus, you can't just decide to move to Canada, it's not easy to get a Visa. That and celcius and the metric system make waaaaay more sense. Luckily, I preemptively moved to Canada like 12 years ago, haha.  And yeah, the cold sucks.

Also, it was only easy for me because I had Canadian citizenship by birth. Did it anyway, have not regretted it one bit since. Saw this coming before it even really existed and now I'm Canadian. 

I hear prayer also helps. 1 prayer = 1 downvote for Trump Unless you're from the northern part of the US! We're used to cold and snow!

Although, I don't have any desire to just pull up stakes and move out. This country, for all its warts and bumps is still great in my opinion. Just because your candidate didn't get elected doesn't mean WWIII/the end of days is upon us.  [What the fuck.](http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/lena-dunham-describes-sexually-abusing-her-toddler-sister) Indeed. Self-admitted, even. Yes. She also made this clever feminist video for your enjoyment. 

https://youtube.com/watch?v=XcAmdHqUsxg Lena "Sister Fister" Dunham Send them to Mexico instead. Hey we took Drake and Bieber it's the least you can do  like hillary! Too hardcore for my taste Way too extreme for me. I'm killing myself with steroids.  If his rhetoric on the campaign trail means anything, those people are crooks and liars to him (especially the FBI at this point).

The one group that might have some clout is the military, and I'm really not sure who he'll be talking to there, as their views on the environment are varied to say the least.

Like most things in America, the problem is that people are isolated in echo chambers, so nothing's ever going to change. Though who knows, Trump/Trump's campaign might have just been smart enough to devise a persona to win the election which doesn't mirror his own views, I can only hope that's the truth. What?  Those agencies have nothing to do with climate change science or legislature.  It'd be the EPA (who Trump was on record as saying he wanted to "get rid of it" while campaigning), the NOAA, and other environmental agencies that would brief him. Not American, only have a passing interest in your politics - certainly not enough to watch a dudes speech. 

Also that sounds shit. Why is that weird?  Climate change isn't a religious thing, it's an economic thing.  Curtailing emissions requires doing things that are not going to maximize profits, which is why corporations (and the Congressmen they lobby for) resist it. The secret service is glorified bodyguards, they have no power. Yeah, that is the saddest part. That both sides are at extremes and not talking. Not like the "haha libtards" people help but neither do the "Drumpf racists" either.

Yeah, I look forward to things normalizing. It will probably be a couple days and then when he gets into office that the circlejerk will continue. After that, I look forward to not seeing pro-Hillary circlejerking on r/politics. I don't blame you, I'm not a fan either.  I'm so sick of hearing election bullshit and I'm ready to disable Facebook because all it shows now is people bitching about trump, crying doom, etc etc etc. I agree with you I am terrified at the possibility of immediate action, but I try to set aside my terror as I believe it is irrational. Even after recent events I still have hope for us humans. Only after thoroughly grabbing by the pussy does he know them. ;) Conversion therapy is a freaky topic. Sorry that had to happen, especially in public internet. Facebook has rarely been a positive experience in my life even. It's mostly just volunteering your life and interactions with others to be under the microscope of everyone you know.  She won popular by less than 200k.  Out of 120 *million* votes, in a country of 330 million people.  That is literally the thinnest popular margin in the history of this country, right next to JFK with ~115k/60m. Bernie got ~~49~~ 43% of the vote despite collusion between the DNC and Hillary, wasn't about to be investigated by the FBI, would have secured anti-establishment votes instead of giving them all away to Trump, and most importantly had passionate voters behind him *like a certain republican candidate.* But they went with "well Hillary is probably palatable." It's frustrating. I watched Hillary's nomination ceremony and everyone brushing his impact off and kept waiting for something good to come out of it... And they just sidelined him and forged on.  But California and NYC don't a country make as much as Facebook today wishes it were the case. As much as it may seem great today I shudder to think of a time when someone could pander to just cities and make decisions for everyone.  They gave her a 400 point lead from the start. Why would people vote for the loser when they're so far behind? The super delegates were a fucking sham. The USA is a big country. There's a lot of power and money in it. Tempting to even the best of us.  Pretty reasonable assertion.  I do think that our country suffers from only having two political parties of note, but our electoral system would be a nightmare if we had several parties like most European countries do. If it were abolished, then the candidates would have campaigned differently, in different places, and would have gotten different voting numbers in the end. "Hillary would've won" is a bit presumptuous. I understand the system needs to be in place if you take each state's majority vote, but think about what a per-person vote would achieve. We went from democracy to indirect democracy, and now the US is at "indirect indirect democracy". Honestly looks like we're just adding bureaucracy to the system.

It makes the common man's vote seem irrelevant. (In this specific election, it wouldn't matter if the people who voted for Hillary in Florida voted at all, the electoral votes would still all go to Trump.) And on top of that, some areas (especially rural ones, since the minimal number of electoral votes a state can have is 3) are over-represented. I'd argue that even some of the more populated states could be misrepresented, because of the simple fact that the number of electoral votes has to be a natural number (i.e. you can't have 13.7 votes, it has to be either 13 or 14). Publishers decide release dates. TF2 should've been a holiday season release at the earliest.    A lot of people didn't get the help they wanted in the past 8 years, a lot of rural America is worse off in some ways. So to them, things are not good.  

I think no matter what people get left in the dust, theres really no way around it. You can help save the environment by closing down factories, but you are also taking away a lot of jobs.  If you can get rid of guns you can save a lot of lives,  but you are taking away jobs and money for environmental conservation. 
To some people, those losses are worth it for the good of the people, unless you are the ones losing. 

 The only thing the democrats did with the FED was kick the can down the road.    > the Democrats turned the economy around

When an economy crashes history says it will almost always get better afterwards, and usually much faster than it has been in this particular situation. "The wall will never be built"

As of last night, there are too many things Trump has done that people said would never happen for me to completely agree.  As an openly bisexual woman... this is terrifying. Funny, I wonder how Trump's gonna deal with those creepy callers on Glenn Beck who threatened to make him pay if he didn't make the wall... > Not to mention if Obamacare gets repealed it could be argued that we go back down to earlier levels of health spending

Please god no. The reason rates are going up is because insurers can't deny coverage based on preexisting conditions anymore. It would be fucking devastating to go back to pre-Obamacare. It needs to be combined with a public option though to actually work, but fat chance of seeing any tax increase anytime soon to actually make that happen. I think people are so pissed off with the rate increase that they just assume the whole thing is broken and would rather see it repealed entirely. Not intense, just absurd to imagine Game family, obv Moon Sugar is a naturally occuring ingredient used by some other races of Nirn apart from the Khajiit, but Skooma is refined from these sugars (not the other way around as the teachings of the Hist vaguely imply.) Maaannn dont even talk about Elder Scrolls right now. That new update screwed up my Skyrim SE. End me. 😖 Most likely. Makes it so things are all blurry and bright, also brings back the real harmful effects of Skooma like back in Morrowind.  "A few" is a vast understatement. Also I couldn't ever catch enemies that ran so I just said fuck it and became a straight destruction mage.  I think the media villified trump and trump supporters to the point that if you supported trump you kept your mouth shut. I would see Hilary supporters flip shit on trump supporters without having a debate. It's okay I'm feeling the Johnson anyways! 538 doesn't do polls, they do poll aggregation. They take a bunch of polls and create a prediction based on what the polls are saying. Silver was complaining because pollsters were "herding", that is, to avoid being seen as an outlier they were weighting their results towards a conclusion, in this case in favor of Hillary. The 538 model had Trump at a 25% chance to win before the election, which is on the more conservative side out of all the other election models like the New York Times which gave Trump a 1%. 1/4, or 25% chance, isn't that far outside the realm of possibility - everyone's amazed Trump won but if I had a 1/4 chance to win the lottery I'd do it in a heartbeat. Hillary is extremely predictable in terms of policy. She's a politician through and through. A lot of pepper criticize her for having different private opinions on certain subjects than what she actually says publicly, and that she changes her mind according to what's popular among the voters, but I think if she's willing to do what the voters want regardless of her feelings, then that means she's doing her job. You can trust her to do what gets her votes. We'll just immigrate illegally. What are they going to do? Build a wall? Is the Canadian population generally accepting of American immigrants? That is fucked up beyond repair. Typical white-male hating le liberal feminist  Well, maybe *she* could be the first female president then?  Wow what a well made and thought provoking video Holy shit, that was the dumbest and most baseless feminist argument I've ever seen... And I've seen some doozies. really makeds u dink  Maybe the DNC will get her to run lmao Noodles? Nah FBI is only crooked when they say Hillary is innocent. Same with the election being rigged, could you imagine if trump lost while winning the popular vote. >military views of climate varied

Why do you say that? EPA, NOAA, those sound like alphabet agencies to me. My comment isn't about the environment in particular it's about the people who will be giving him the "this is actually how shit works" speeches. There will be a long line of them and for the most part they won't be politicians.  He is already on record as having a climate denier lined up to help reorganise and castrate the EPA...Saw The article elsewhere on Reddit, I'd link it but am on mobile and it has faded in to the mountain of purple links I have looked at while waiting in this God forsaken airport. Well as an American I'd like to apologize to your great great grandchildren as Trump and the GOP are likely to trigger an utter collapse of all global efforts to reduce emissions. Hehe ya I mean it's weird that religious people seem to deny climate change when the pope doesn't. But now that I'm typing that I realize I'm trying to apply logic to religious people. Maybe so but they have ready access to the president which is essential if you want to stage an accident. I wouldn't agree. We're very short sighted. This time two parties hurt us. Generally we have two decent candidates even if we prefer one over the other.  Rural America (I live there) is only hurting because they can't accept that our manufacturing jobs of the past aren't coming back. Same with coal. Just holding onto the past and thinking Trump gives 1 shit about them. And I find that constantly amusing.

Now I get to sit back and hope they don't come burn my house down because I don't give a crap if guys wanna fuck each other and I care even less what a woman wants to do with her body.  they said he wouldn't be the nominee

they said he wouldn't win the election 

they said he wouldn't build the wall I'd put money on *a* wall being built. My bet is it will be about 6 feet tall and about 100 yards long and that will be it. I'm calling it now. The reason rates are going up is because the insurance companies see something they can use as an excuse to raise rates and there weren't any regulations in place to protect low income citizens from that. The initial things I've read say that a full blown repeal would be an exceedingly stupid idea and there's almost no reason to do it. The expectation is if Trump follows what he's claimed before is that they'll get rid of the mandate and push for a public option, but who knows how that'll go in the Republican Congress. Yo! What up, Gam?!
 They should of implemented addiction in Skyrim like they did with Fallout 3 (and now Fallout 4). Skooma and alcohol addiction. Alcohol is important because I remember playing and buying a bunch of flagons of special alcohol from Riften that provided +15 stamina or something. You could drink as many as you need (IIRC) and it was cheap so it was a good work around. Get rid of it by implemented addiction.



Inb4 "check out this mod". I'd love to if my laptop wasn't composed of a potato connected to a screen. I played Skyrim on the PS3. Which sucks because I thoroughly enjoy modding the hell out Oblivion and Morrowind on my PC. I bet sabercats and bears were a worse experience at low level. Damn Trumpbacks http://balanceoffood.typepad.com/.a/6a00e55214ffbe883401b7c7d3328f970b-pi
 Well pussy grabbing IS the new prerequisite for presidency. Really made me think... That's happened before and it's completely normal for our type of system.  It looks rigged to the layman, but it's functioning as intended otherwise.  I don't like that, and it's one of several reasons I'm in favor of electoral reform, however. Gotcha.  Then, yeah, it'll be alphabet agencies.  Technically I believe those agencies will inform his secretaries, and then his secretaries will inform him, though. I live in Rural America as well I'm even worse off. I am very openly bisexual and a woman who supports abortion. I think I am going to turn into a hermit the next few years. Fuck this shit. I really hope this list is kept short.  Going well tbqhwyg I hate the normal Vanilla Skooma, its basically a re skinned stamina potion ! IIRC one of the problems Fallout 3 had in Australia was getting through their notorious rating board,  as such they were forced to change a couple of the drugs in the game to different things. I believe it was that Adrenaline was changed to Jet and Morphine was Changed to Med-X, so the game would be passed. I guess they decided it would be better to make the changes universal instead of just change the Australia version.

Thus when they were making Skyrim they probably knew there was going to be an issue if they included addiction in the game because of the alcohol and thus decided to not even bother.

Hell I can almost guarantee they just love being able to kill those annoying as fuck kids in their games during development, but they know if they allowed that in the actual release the media would freak the fuck out. Which would not bode well for the company. Honestly. Wolves/bears/sabres scared me more than dragons.  Is that why Bill Clinton was elected for president? Or was he ahead of his time? Only consensual though! Sure worked for Bill. Contemplating suicide counts as thinking. > That's happened before

That happened this time. It's intended to give the low-density, large farm areas of the nation equal say. And it does.

Popular vote has been done once in America. 1860.

Let's not do that again, thanks. Eh just keep on walking. You will survive this too. Hopefully you have at least a pretty good support system. And Amazon Prime.  Jet came from Fallout 2, so you're probably thinking of something else. Looking at the Fallout wikia's citations it seems like even the identification of Med-X with Morphine is guesswork (though it's a pretty good guess). He just set the fad. Others followed.  Consensual crotch grabbing is basically how the circle of life goes on. I think I'll use the rope this time... Only just barely :P I have Amazon Prime, but basically no support system. As someone who grew up with Roller Coaster Tycoon, it's so depressing to see them fall so far and releasing an unfinished product like this. A last ditch attempt to make 50 more dollars off an utter failure of a game before its far superior competition smashes it into the ground where it belongs. I truly feel sorry for anyone who had the misfortune to have worked on this game. Sounds like the biggest dev clusterfuck and it shows in the product. 

So happy I have planet coaster to enjoy. It's worth mentioning there's another game called Parkitect on Steam.

Parkitect is more similar to RCT 1 & 2.

Planet Coaster is similar to RCT 3. Honestly, just stop throwing up in my goddamned park. Learn your limits. The "Master Blaster" isn't for you. Accept that. All these damn maintenance men are destroying my bottom line. Sawyer's probably rolling in his train car right now Fuck "Atari".

I used to work for GT Interactive in the late '90s doing support. At the time we owned Atari and the entire back catalog, with the Atari dev team being 2 or 3 people in a small office in So. Cal I believe ( I was in the Seattle offices, so don't know for sure). I was there the day that Infogrames pres. Bruno came to check out our operation to decide if they were going to finalize the deal to buy us out. I have never seen a more imposing presence in my life. It was like Darth Vader entered the room. Just before the sale finalized, I got a job opportunity doing IT for another company and took it. Two weeks later "Black Monday" happened where the building was locked up and half the company was laid off with no warning. Soon after that they rebranded the US branch of the company Atari, to capitalize on the name recognition.

Fast forward a little over a decade and I was working at Flying Lab Software doing software testing for the MMO "Pirates of the Burning Sea". Best job in tech I ever had. Great company, fantastic team, and amazing players. At that point we were on our last legs though and needed money to keep going. Atari approached us to make a new RCT game. We did some design work ups that they said they liked, and offered a (from what I was told) horrible contract. We counter-offered and they took weeks to reply with their counter-counter offer. We responded with our changes and we didn't hear from them for a month, the entire time telling us that it looked ok and that they were waiting on a higher up to sign off on it. Meanwhile we were out of money and lay-offs started happening. Two weeks later we get the response of "Nah, we're done" and then very soon after the shtty DS game came out. We had to close down forever. 

Come to find out later, that due to how the original purchase of GT Interactive went down, they didn't actually own RTC, and they had to come out with a game to retain the rights they had bought. They were playing us waiting to see if they could get a better deal with a different company. It would not surprise me if this new game isn't just a quick play for cash, but a way to retain the rights for the game due to the deal they made on the initial purchase (Think of Fox making crappy Fantastic Four movies, specifically because of the way the deal for the rights to the characters were made when Marvel initially sold them ages ago).

So, yea. Fuck "Atari".

Also, if they hadn't screwed us over like that FLS, you would have gotten a 1940's pulp MMO using the the Cryptic engine. From what we had done and were testing, it was going to be a fucking amazing game. Again, Fuck "Atari".

And yes, I am still bitter. Roller Coaster Tycoon World was technically released earlier this year until negative reviews made them chicken out and put it back to 'pre-release'. From what I've seen, nothing has been done to improve RCT World. They definitely appear to be fishing for new buyers without actually fixing any of the noted issues. Dick move but not surprised.

I'll be buying both Planet Coaster and Parkitect and skipping RCT World completely. Steam reviews Mostly Negative on Roller Coaster Tycoon World and it really deserves it. I own both... played the alpha a few weeks back for Planet Coaster and was amazed at what you could build. After it ended I decided to give Roller Coaster Tycoon World a go again (bought it early on for whatever reason) and they just don't compare. It's like RCT:W has the quality of a crappy mobile game. It's a shame but hey... least we have Planet Coaster! I saw a physical copy of the new RCT in a Walmart a few weeks ago. I had no idea it existed! Then I went home and saw it had terrible reviews on Steam, and it was an early access game. That looked so dirty - early access, yet physical copies in stores.  how's planet coaster doing? I lost faith in RCT way back when they beta'd it but i thought PC had problems too, is it that better now? MY MAN! I was about to grab the new Tycoon! Thanks! Having a look at Planet Coaster. It's been in early access for a while and I can tell you it is some seriously hot garbage. Do not buy this game!  
Edit: 26% positive reviews on steam lmao Atari is basically just a zombie brand, being sold and relicensed over decades.  [Atari did essentially invent the unfinished cash grab video game.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EFt-La3UUu0/maxresdefault.jpg) Planet coaster is great.  There are some minor bugs to work out, but they've done a great job of listening to feedback.  They just released a patch to the beta today that allows you to make your park 2.5x bigger.  I hope it gets the success it deserves, IMO. Can confirm, Planet Coaster is far superior. Great game. Planet coaster is out this week? Excellent. Hows it looking?  Here is a video that Nerdcubed did in April on the 3 big Theme Park games, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, Parkitect, and Planet Coaster if anyone is interested!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVUa58oY0T0


Also, Nerdcubed in general has some GREAT themepark videos. All of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series, Parkitect, and Planet Coaster! As someone who bought both, my personal biased opinion is for Planet Coaster. As soon as I saw RCTW come out on steam, I hoped right onto it. 

It was depressing...The game ran like complete shit: for instance, at least in my case, the game ran only 13 frames faster on low settings at 1080p than at Max at 4k. Not that it matters. The peeps are not animated at a distance, and the only thing going for it is the spline system for building rides.

Planet coaster on the other hand has been one of the best purchases of the year! I feel the same excitement that I felt in RCT2 and RCT3, and the customization is immense. Peep's have some sort of opinion, and _actually_ move when zoomed out. It's just... Awe inspiring. I have spent ten hours in the last 2 days just playing the game. I feel my creative side coming out, and the menus, though confusing at first, are somewhat intuitive (yes, that is sort of stupid to say, the correct word escapes me.)

I feel like I'm designing a park rather than rides. I feel like I have to conform to my peep's wants and needs, and the AI designed for Planet coaster are actually intelligent!

TL:DR as a real user that has both games, Planet Coaster is the clear winner. CPU usage will be high with this one 'cause advanced AI need dank clock cycles. Don't forget there's also OpenRCT2 to play. Atari ceased to exist as you know it in 1998 and became simply a brand name, not an organization. They exist only to wield their name for this kind of thing.

edit: [for the curious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Interactive) SECOND THIS! I paid for early access to both, let me tell you a little about them.  
  
RCTW looked promising around this time last year, and was supposed to be released last December. Then the first Beta went live last October, and it was met with pretty mixed reviews. It only  showed off the coaster editor, and it didn't meet expectations. But we had hope that it would get better by the next Beta scheduled in November. November came and went, no Beta. December came and went, no release. Suddenly, Atari announces that the game will be by the end of the first quarter of 2016. On the LAST day of the first quarter, the game did not release, but instead went into Early Access. The game could be found being sold on store shelves, with the only hint that it wasn't a completed game being the tiny words 'Early Access' thrown in at the bottom of the case on the back. They were intentionally trying to trick people into buying an incomplete, and quite frankly shitty game. Skip forward several months and some good and bad updates later, and they suddenly announce it will release ONE DAY before Planet Coaster is scheduled to release. Look up any gameplay videos and you will see it is not worth buying. You can't make smooth coasters, the physics are shit, the peeps look like zombie-aliens, the graphics in general are terrible for a game in 2016, it bugs out like crazy, and forget trying to run a park with more than 500 peeps in it...even some pretty high end machines struggle to run this game because it's so poorly optimized. Oh, and it runs in Unity, which isn't bad in itself, but it is when you see how many Unity games look run 100x better. And I'm not even going to get into how the game went through 3 developers.  
  
Planet Coaster is the true winner here. First of all, it's worth noting right away that it is being developed AND self-published by Frontier, the studio behind Elite: Dangerous as well as Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and the expansions for Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. They were also responsible for a few other theme park sim games like Thrillville and Screamride. Planet Coaster is the perfect balance of a beautiful, fun, addicting game. Of course on the management side, Frontier has had a lot of Tycoon game experience and know how to balance it well. The rides are diverse and can be customized down to the ride sequence. There is a robust piece by piece building system that has allowed users to create detailed versions of Hogwarts, the Colosseum, the Space Mountain building, the list of what has been done and what is possible is seemingly never ending. The coaster editor is slightly more difficult to learn than RCTW, but for a good reason. You can create just about any coaster you think up with the editor, it is very versatile. I could on for some time praising every detail in Planet Coaster, but honestly you just have to see it for yourself. What?  Atari would never rush out a shitty, half finished game with game breaking bugs.  You'd have to be some sort of extraterrestrial from outer space to believe that. Atari is a shriveled shadow of its former self. PSA for RCT fans out there, OpenRCT is an open source modern engine that uses RCT1 and RCT2 assets so you can play those games on modern PC with whatever resolution you want. Those games aged well!

http://openrct2.org/

https://www.reddit.com/r/openrct2/ That's not Atari.  It's Infogrames wearing the rotting corpse face of Atari. So, like how Sim City came out before Cities: Skylines? But there are 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets to explore! This is a classic case of a company knowing fair well they have lost against Planet Coaster & deciding the only possible way they can make money back is to confuse people into buying their game instead of Planet Coaster.

They had no intention of releasing it until they saw the final release of Planet Coaster. They also had no intention of releasing it in Early Access until they saw what Planet Coaster was doing with the Alpha and Beta's from their website.

It's all down to them having a product that's worse that the competition & trying to confuse people into buying the wrong game. Planet coaster is such an in depth and creative building game, customizable and beautiful down to the smallest details.

The main feature that is conducive to sitting down for hours and creating, for me, is the [relaxing soundtrack by Jim Guthrie](http://www.streetstalkin.com/jim-guthrie-jj-ipsen-to-release-score-for-planet-coaster-videogame/)
 Yeah my girl friend who has been a huge fan of RCT forever got the bundle of every RCT game a while ago, including world, with the development (or lack there of of world) shes come tho the conclusion that the game sucks, and wanted a refund, since she has spent less than 30 mins, BUT since she spent TONS of time on the previous versions she cant get her refund. Pretty upsetting. Rollercoaster Tycoon World is awful. It's amazing how many people try to defend it when I point out how broken it is.  Okay, so I bought RCT:W for 20$ at Gamestop, just a blind purchase so let me give you a small review of the game.

It's OKAY, I guess. It doesn't hold up to anything like the old ones do, but it has some neat features like Steam Workshop and a full on "Story Mode" more as scenarios I feel. It also has Sandbox, but it plays a lot like Cities: Skylines and the RCT: Mobile game. In order to expand your park, you buy lots of land for said amount of price. The camera is just horrid to play around with. Zoom in to much your staring right at the Peeps feet and/or sidewalk. Zoom to far out and you can't see your park. Also to mention, the Peeps are just so...STIFF. THEY WALK SO STIFF, also when you zoom out they no longer to the walking animation and just glide across the path.

Bottom line, Don't buy it, save your money for Planet Coaster (which I have not played) or Parkitect, which I have played with over 50 some odd hours in.

What's [Parkitect](http://store.steampowered.com/app/453090/) you ask? It's exactly like RCT1 and RCT2, but more detailed and in-depth. YES, it is an Early Access game, but seriously, this game is well worth the $20 asking price. First off, let me say it has Scenarios if that's your thing, and Sandbox in Small map, or Big map (which is pretty huge to be honest.) It does have Steam Workshop (I recommend the "Devs Collection Pack", it's got some really neat stuff.) You can build your own assets as well. The Coaster Creator is neat, I haven't played with that as much as I would like. 

Bottom line, get this or Planet Coaster, OR whatever, it's your money! Atari is the worst. I did a learning example how to code Pong game for new game developers and they sent DMCA letter to my hosting provider to cancel my hosting because I named the example "Pong" which they have trademark on.  So I went and purchased Planet Coaster last night after reading this, thanks! I absolutely cannot believe how terribly they treated this franchise. RCT4 could have made them a tremendously stupid amount of money (this is a eight to nine figure franchise) if they had done it right.

Atari has never recovered from 83. Tramiel was the nail in the coffin it seems (even if he did okay with a product or two). If this is true then I am very disappointed. I must ask you though how you know for certain it will fail and be released in an unfinished state? I haven't been following either game, but unless there is some beta access out now which isn't even representative of the final product, how are can some it will be bad.  Does planet coaster have any type of loose campaign? I used to like to play ZooTycoon and after I had a large attendance, block the exits and open the tiger cages.  You're a fucking saint. And I don't even play those games. Never Forget:
http://imgur.com/gallery/Wxzbl So... Simcity vs Cities : Skylines yet again ? :D [removed] I didn't even know Atari is still in business. It's sad to see how low they've fallen. This company used to make history. Make Rollercoasters great again! Planet Coaster looks pretty cool. Rctw is relying on the rollercoaster tycoon brand to sell. And luckily for them, as said, naive buyers will buy it for this reason.

My advice to people considering rctw is to check out a video of it before buying, and you will see how lazy and unpolished the game is.

You know something is wrong when rct3, a game that game out approx. 10 years ago, looks better, plays better, has a superior art style etc. Mild r/titlegore  So you're saying it's *No Man's Coaster*? One should hope the advent of steam refunds will see such pointless and costumer-hostile stratagies vanish in due time. Well this is the first I'm hearing about either so... Neat fact about the original game: It was written almost completely in Assembly.  (99% assembly)

Here's what a hello world program look like in assembly, so you have an idea of how much meticulous work this guy went through (stolen from Wikipedia).  Oh yeah, I said guy.  It was ONE guy who wrote it.  (they had others do graphics stuff, but for actual code, he was it)

    ; Image base = 0x00400000
    %define RVA(x) (x-0x00400000)
    section .text
    push dword hello
    call dword [printf]
    push byte +0
    call dword [exit]
    ret
    
    section .data
    hello db "Hello world!"
    
    section .idata
    dd RVA(msvcrt_LookupTable)
    dd -1
    dd 0
    dd RVA(msvcrt_string)
    dd RVA(msvcrt_imports)
    times 5 dd 0 ; ends the descriptor table
    
    msvcrt_string dd "msvcrt.dll", 0
    msvcrt_LookupTable:
    dd RVA(msvcrt_printf)
    dd RVA(msvcrt_exit)
    dd 0
    
    msvcrt_imports:
    printf dd RVA(msvcrt_printf)
    exit dd RVA(msvcrt_exit)
    dd 0
    
    msvcrt_printf:
    dw 1
    dw "printf", 0
    msvcrt_exit:
    dw 2
    dw "exit", 0
    dd 0

 It's so sad. I'm sure the devs know it's a clusterfuck. It's just that whatever parent company owns Atari is doing everything they can in order to make back the ungodly millions they surely spent on that RCT license. Looks like the Cities XXL and Cities Skylines situation. also should be noted that Planet Coaster was made by people who worked on the Tycoon series and has been getting a lot of love online by fans of the series.
 All i care about is still being able to kill park customers like the old games.  Can anyone help me. This post reminded me of a game from my childhood I am trying to find. I got a demo disc of it the mail one day in the early 2000s. It was a roller coaster game but I don't think it was any of the tycoons. It was only for building and riding roller coaster. I don't think it had a park element to it. The main thing I remember was that you could build a coaster on Mars, put props all around to decorate the landscape (my favorite was the small moons), and the accelerator rails were kinda ridiculous.

I just can't remember the name. PlanetCoaster is from the guys who made RCT3(and Elite Dangerous)! The new RCT has nothing to do with the old Games and is just a cheap Cashgrab for uninformed people. For anyone undecided or without knowledge of either product, Planet Coaster is by a long way the best theme park sim ever released. The building customization and object layering makes it so youre basically able to create anything you can imagine. That is before custom objects as well. It's a shame at whats happened with RCT world. Really looking forward to Planet coaster though.

I grew up with the RCT games and they were endless fun 1999 is about when I got my first "gaming" PC and RCT was one of the first, to see them being handled like this is a bit upsetting. at least the guys from RCT3 are at the helm of Planet Coaster. Don't forget "Atari" screwing over Jeff Minter for no good reason. 

http://minotaurproject.co.uk/YakImages/surprised_and_dismayed.pdf

Never a cent to those bottom feeders.  It will just end up buried in the desert Prepare yourself /r/gaming/ .... the Planet Coaster GIFS are coming. My body is ready. Would be great if the post had a link to /r/themeparkitect so people could check it out. that planet coaster game looks like a labour of love Atari releasing an unfinished game, I would never believe this, if companies like Atari release unfinished games, then the entire industry may crash Don't forget. It's already a year behind.
RCT is dead
 Planet Coaster is really impressive stuff ! Just catched the beta and it is so powerfull as a build tool :) :) :) I had never played RCT 3 (I know, blasphamy) however I have been a RCT 1/2 addict since I was a kid. I play it all the time. I bought Planet Coaster last week, and Im blown away. Fantastic game. 9/10, would recommend I pre-ordered RCTW when it was announced, not knowing the history.  I grew up on all 3 previous ones.  The initial launch was planned for Dec of LAST year.  The "beta" they did a couple months before that was really more of an alpha - and it was not very good.  Here we are, a year later in "early access", and they've come a long way.  However, I have to agree that it's not a very solid game.

I can honestly say, it's not a great looking game.  The peeps don't walk - they float.  Their animations are college student worthy.  They have no personality.  To me, the game is also very warm looking. Like, it's not bright and colorful - it's more sunset/hazy.  It also takes literally 1-2 minutes to load a saved game.   Planet Coaster has always been loaded with personality.  They don't make you rely on big emotion icons over people's heads to tell how they're feeling - you can see it in their appearance/actions.  They're animated well, as are the rides and coasters.  They feel like they have weight and substance.  The textures are great - things look and reflect like the material they're made to replicate.  I don't have that same feeling with stuff in RCTW.

To RCTW's credit, they did have more gameplay than Planet Coaster - but that was on purpose on PC's part.  Their alpha strategy was testing out each piece in phases rather than throw everything out and see what's broken or not.  So up until the 3rd alpha and the recent beta, there wasn't a Career mode or simulation/park management stuff.  However, all those items are in the game now and are going to be expanded in a few days on release.

RE: the OP's "unfinished" statement, they're both technically unfinished.  But PC didn't go full blast with too much content and refine everything later to be functional.  They put out solid, working framework pieces every few months.  Some stuff that RCTW copied and added to their game during their EA.  Frontier listens to the community and has added a ton of requested changes and functions, and I expect that to continue far in the future.  The ONLY thing that RCTW has over PC right now is that UGC through the Workshop is available for set pieces.  However, PC has that planned as an update after the full release.  

So looping back to my opening statement - and to concur with the OP's PSA - realize that RCTW is not based on any RCT game or being done by a developer who has done them before.  Don't buy it based on the name.  Planet Coaster is made by the people who made RCT3 and worked on RCT2.  It's built off all of the knowledge they learned by making RCT3 and expanded over the last 10 years.  If you're going to buy a coaster/theme park sim, watch some Youtube videos in a few days once they're both released and make a decision based on how people feel when they play the games.  But I think you'll find more people enjoying their time with PC. Just want to notify everyone that NerdCubed has uploaded a [new Roller Coaster Tycoon World video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjVkXCyfWdc)

You can compare the new video with his [Planet Coaster playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Sz7_l-PtwC6TGKHDuGL-fSYFF8nbYgn) I don't know if anyone remembers The Wheel of Time game (based on the Robert Jordan books), but they released the CD ROM version that DID NOT WORK and WOULD NOT INSTALL. Then, they charged consumers to replace the discs with working versions. Fuck Atari! meh they released it like 6 months ago and then pulled it back and called it a beta.

sadly, all I want is campaign, which I dont believe PC has any of. Atari is* I'm glad to see people are bringing attention to this. I've known which one I was going to buy since I first heard of Planet Coaster. Atari might have the rights to RollerCoaster Tycoon, but it was Frontier that really made it fun. I've played RCT3 a couple of times recently with my little brother watching me. He thought it was a pretty cool game, but he didn't like the graphics and how you couldn't build certain things. When I told him they were making a newer, better one, he was super happy. I'm buying Planet Coaster not just for myself to enjoy, buy also to help keep the theme-park management genre love going. It's a genre that deserves better than play-to-win mobile games and crappy official games. I previously purchased all three upcoming theme park games because of my love for Roller Coaster Tycoon. I still play Planet Coaster and Parkitect all the time, but will never touch Roller Coaster Tycoon World again. What have you done Atari? They're just trying to avoid having to bury all the copies of it in the desert. "Early Access Game
Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops.

Note: This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development. "

Right in the description. How fucking blind do you have to be to not see the warning? Atari are?  Atari is a singular entity.  Atari is.   Atari..?

I thought Atari was dead and gone.  How do we know you don't work for Planet Coaster? "Incorporates 3rd party DRM:Denuvo"

Well that saved me £26 I still want both, good or bad. I'll make do I've heard RCT:W was poorly built, this is just heresay, someone correct me if I'm wrong. I miss Keystone Cops. [Planet Coaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTpgZ3EMNqI), reviewed by Northernlion So... basically ET 2?  Nice try planet coaster dev team 

J/k I know nothing about either game.  I was so excited about RCT World and have been following its development closely. It was so depressing to realize what a shitshow it was going to be :( I don't get it, didn't this game come out couple of months ago already? Frontier, the guys behind Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, are the guys making Planet Coaster. It's basically RCT3 turned up to 11. The new Roller Coaster Tycoon has been passed around different devs, like a bad one night stand. I felt the same way about Sim City. This isn't Atari though. It's Infogrames who bought the Atari name and dumped theirs because it was shit. But the thing is, they're still shit. The name didn't fix anything but sucker gamers into buying their garbage again.

*edit: infogrames* But at least with classics shitting the bed we great games like City Skylines and Planet Roller Coaster RCT3 was pretty decent but I think once it left Chris Sawyers hands it was doomed. 
Atari may of been the shit in its day but I  haven't put any faith in them in a number of years.  Sheesh, this is a flashback to Sim City 2013, and a little while later when City Skylines came out which ground the original franchise into the dirt. Sim City released and you couldn't play it for a week, then they disabled features so it could work, but the gameplay was buggy as heck and cities would destroy themselves under their own weight, even with their comparably tiny build space. They claimed you couldn't build outside of the box for reasons, and then someone mods it a tiny bit and suddenly you could. Lost saves because it was always online, and they wouldn't budge on that (but eventually did). They hyped up the idea that sims are all individuals, then programmed them to go to the first house they came across coming back from work, which caused the stupid traffic issues that plagued the game for months.

Best thing I got out of Sim City 2013 was a free copy of Mass Effect 3 from their apology.

Honestly. Hope all the best for Planet Coaster. These franchises have been constant companions growing up, and it sucks when they go off rails, but its good when someone picks them up. A lot of the guys who are working on this titles are former employees from the secret world who have moved to a new studio or that studio got bought out. I can't remember which happened. 

Source: former employee on the secret work who is friends with people who are now working on roller coaster tycoon world. Can you give me some more details? I only played RCT2 and absolutely loved it as a kid. Planet Coaster looks awesome, but I haven't seen much about Parkitect. I'd still love to play a game with the feeling and mood of Bullfrog's Theme Park. I got into a RCT mood a few months back and bought into the beta for both of those games. I personally enjoyed Parkitech more as it was more casual and like the RCT I played as a kid but Planet Coaster has some amazing world detail and I see a ton of potential for building realistic theme parks.  That's actually why I stopped playing these games.  So much puke to clean up. I want to get off Atari's Wild Ride (Chris Sawyer is indeed still alive if anyone else was about it google him) IIRC Sawyer has the ability to tell Atari to fuck off, but hasn't for some reason. We're on what, the 4th or 5th company that owns the Atari brand? The original company is long dead. This is a really interesting comment. Thanks for sharing! Is there any source code left for the 40s pulp MMO? Maybe someone could pick it up? Man, I cyber-stalked Pirates of the Burning Sea for *years*.

I'm pretty sure I bought it and played it for a while. > "Atari"

I like the way [RPS](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/11/11/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-release-date/) reported this

>The creature wearing the skin of Atari has announced astonishing plans to launch RollerCoaster Tycoon World next Wednesday, November 16th Atari had a bad habit of not paying companies their due. Left several small companies high and dry. Atari's basically the reason Star Trek Online had the shitty start it had, too. I've played it on and off since about a year after it started, before it went free-to-play. Atari fucked the game over with lack of funding and general mismanagement. It wasn't until Perfect World Entertainment took over that things started really improving, because PWE actually put money into the game and lit a fire under the dev's asses when it came to producing results. Game's completely different from what it used to be, for good or ill. Way back in 2007 I got to meet a good number of people from Flying Labs Software at SOE Fan Faire. Seriously the nicest and most dedicated dev team I've ever met. The game was still in beta but I remember how much passion everyone had. I was so happy to score a few beta keys and my little group of friends played PotBS sooo much. Great times.

Fuck Atari.  I worked at Atari for 9 months in 2012 and it was the worst 9 months of my life. I raged quit on a business trip. And I'm usually a very mild mannered person.  This is what really confuses me. I paid $15 for it like 6 months ago. Played it for 20 minutes and uninstalled it. Bad game. Did I buy a pre-release version and not know it?

http://i.imgur.com/PgwGOOg.png You played Parkitect yet? Supremely polished for an alpha > Roller Coaster Tycoon World was technically released earlier this year until negative reviews made them chicken out and put it back to 'pre-release'. 

steam shouldn't allow this bullshit
 That's because Atari contracted development of RCT:W to a mobile game studio that had no previous experience making full PC games. Because it was removed from early access and published, then put back into Early Access when they were rightfully slammed for it sucking. Haha interesting. I haven't heard of that. That's cause it was a full releace at one point earlier this year and had such bad reviews that it went back into beta With about 50 hours in the alpha and beta, here are the problems I've run into:

- Once an hour or two the camera likes to zoom to a different part of my park

- Some minor issues with path placement

- My guests spent 10 days on a roller coaster and still thought it was fun.

I never played RCT3, just 1 and 2. I have Parkitect and Planet Coaster and highly recommend Planet Coaster for any RCT fans. You wont regret it, it's a hundred times better. Couldn't of asked for a better theme park game, especially with more updates to come. May I recommend you No Man Sky instead of new Tycoon then? I saw the video from E3 and it looked FANTASTIC. Ya. I was surprised to see it's still around Fuck that game and those stupid pits. And the original pacman on the vcs. $40 pre-order was the only way to get it and it was awful. This was in the very early 80's. E.T. was the next game I got. Man, what a suck-fest those two were.  The level of customization is amazing. The workshop is already full of stuff like this. 

https://youtu.be/Hw0dpG4rI5Q

https://youtu.be/ATjoPl127u8 Very good, I've been playing since Alpha 2, and I'm very happy with what I've seen. Check out some videos of the beta, and take a look a [Silvarret](https://www.youtube.com/user/Silvarret) if you want to know what's possible with the creation tools in PC. As others have said, this is a pretty outdated video. Planet Coaster and Parkitect both have had massive updates. RCTW? Not so much. 

So take what you get from this video and multiply out by three or four  I came to plug that too! OpenRCT2 is amazing. When I get bored I just crank the coaster speed to 500mph and watch the show, LOL. Yes, it is absolutely amazing and runs on all computers without any hiccups > extraterrestrial from outer space

The subtlety of that reference, it's beautiful.  Not even that. More like the shriveled shadow of someone who once saw a picture of Atari from a few decades back and decided to assume their identity.  I'm pretty sure the go ahead for skylines was after the trainwreck of sim city, and paradox realizing there was a market for it + though "we could do it better" You're thinking of cities XXL. Done by a scammer company who bought the franchise. Not really, Cities: Skylines wasn't even announced when SimCity came out. Honestly I think we have the failure of Sim City to thank for Cities: Skylines. The outrage clearly showed that there was a market for games like that, and if done right they could rake in a ton of money. At least Sim City had a semblance of being finished Over 22 billion roller coaster track variations! if it was a bundle though, how would the refund work? I'd still be pretty happy if she got tons of enjoyment out of the others. Just write off the other one. Still sounds like cheap per hour entertainment. Yes, sucks for the last one, but all up not too bad. It's a terrible game with actually decent water physics. Source: I flooded my park with 30 feet of water. That was the limit of my fun. Just rename it Ping or something Enjoy!  It's been in early access since March. It's pretty easy to say that it's nowhere near ready for release RollerCoaster Tycoon: World was a shitstorm during its first trailer release people complained that it looked like garbage, then what do you know development team got replaced with another one (which apparently happened 3 times), this didn't help. 

Months later beta releases and it got covered by some Youtubers; biggest attention I saw was to Nerd3 video comparing RCTW to Planet Coaster. From this everyone saw how poorly it was optimised & designed.

And as was mentioned above by other people RCTW actually "officially" released earlier this year. But due to the negative backlash the game received from fans who felt disappointed, it was put back into the prerelease state.

Following Planet Coasters successful Beta release Atari decided it would try its last move to make a quick cash grab by announcing the "release date" to be on the same as Planet Coaster. Tricking any fans who aren't aware of the shitstorm into buying the game.

TL;DR Don't buy RollerCoaster Tycoon: World. This is one of the biggest cash grab/disappointments to any fans of the series. Buy Planet Coaster instead.


EDIT: Removed comment suggesting unity is a bad engine, as a lot of great games have been made in unity. yes, it has 12 levels Exactly Nope. The game is designed to trick you for a few hours. Like NMS. Have you actually had steam codes PMd to you? Let's bury the game in the desert and never speak of it again  Planet Coaster has scenarios. And it wasn't released.  Its was in Alpha up until last week when the Beta was released. British pluralize the singular noun, even though it sounds like garbage.  People keep buying the name  Honestly? It wouldn't matter if they did, it's true. The game is in early access and it *Sucks*. RCTW was released, and the release was so poorly received that they pulled back and said "Just kidding guys, we meant the *beta* is released." Oh wow, that actually sounds promising. Definitely going to look into Planet Coaster. Would you recommend Planet Coaster to someone who absolutely hated RCT3 but loved the first two ones? I may just pick up Planet coaster as a fuck you to atari.  And if RCT1 and 2 were more your cup of tea there is Theme Parkitect, another incredibly good theme park management game. Wait. Hold up. Give me one second. 

Is this real? I just looked up the trailer and holy shit. Please tell me this is real. I'll preorder planet coaster right now and I've never heard of it.  > Frontier, the guys behind Roller Coaster Tycoon 3

Huh, TIL. Have both, can confirm. PC is the true spiritual successor, RCTW is limited and fairly shitty.  Now if only someone would make a hardcore zoo game, I'd be all over that. Managing to make video game development sound like the place to be though. Unless you work for EA, and get the last 'pass' of the one night stand. "Oh great, I'm #454, she's gonna be all worn out" What kind of one night stands have you had where the girl had just had a couple of guys before it was your turn? When's planet coaster coming out?  They need to make another dino park tycoon!!!  Also the same studio responsible for Elite: Dangerous, which is how I heard about them I keep getting ads for Planet Coaster on Facebook. It looks amazing!!! They're also the same guys who made Elite: Dangerous, which is incredible. Small world, really. Frontier who made Elite Dangerous! I'm not a big fan of RCT3. I feel like it went down hill with that game. I miss the days of 1 and 2. I want another Zoo Tycoon.  Cities: Skylines, though I'd pay to play a new version of SimCopter. that was like my favorite game back in the day. Although I wasn't very good at it. I tried though, lol. Infogram**e**s. This person is right. They changed their name to Atari for the release of Neverwinter Nights.  I hate to break it to you but Atari always had a problem with quality. Regardless of who running the show now it par for the course. > Lost saves because it was always online

Always online single player games. End me. > They hyped up the idea that sims are all individuals, then programmed them to go to the first house they came across coming back from work, which caused the stupid traffic issues that plagued the game for months.

This problem occured because they treated sims like sewerage in the most literal way possible. Sims travel along roads in the same way that water travels through pipes, without knowledge or concern for destination or direction.

Maybe we can use this to extrapolate what EA thinks of people who buy their games. > Best thing I got out of Sim City 2013 was a free copy of Mass Effect 3 from their apology.

Did you get anything from the Mass Effect 3 ending apology? Yeah, I bought into Sim City as well... Even after they fixed a lot, I tried to like it. Fact is it still had crippling problems like a single highway exit which made traffic impossible. I tried so hard to make a casino city but the damn casinos kept dipping into the severe red for no reason. Sim City 2013 was fantastic. The only problem was them calling it "Sim City" instead of "Sim City Online" or the like.  But Skylines wasn't quite as good as any of the earlier Sim City games. The graphics were nice and the road laying system was inspired, but the actual gameplay in Skylines wasn't better than any of the earlier Sim City games before Sim City 2013. I think I'm the only one who managed to find some enjoyment out of Sim City. I mean, it was basically broken... but I've still managed several region play-throughs. The challenge of needing to specialize regions kept me interested enough. 

The launch was a total disaster, though.  /u/javalib video is a good start but it's a little out of date. All 3 games will have improved greatly since then.

Parkitect is more about building and managing your own park, there's more emphasis on customer feedback and moods similar to RCT 1 & 2.

Planet Coaster is more about building a huge ass dank as shit theme park, less emphasis on customers and more emphasis on the complexity of building the park. Im bad at articulating myself but i'll try my best. Parkitect is sort of a minimalist game but at the sametime it's not. In Planet Coaster to design a section of a park WELL you would need to spend a few hours, in Parkitect you can do it in 30 min. That isn't to diminish the game itself, i think it's a great game.

The art style is fantastic, i provided a link down below to their mod-gallery that can give you a good idea. The dev team has worked really close with the community aswell.

https://parkitectnexus.com/assets/blueprint [Here's a comparison of the three](https://youtu.be/ZVUa58oY0T0) Put up trash cans and benches. Have handy men patrol roller coaster paths with mowing turned off.  It's an old meme, Bob, but it checks out. Has he ever made any statement on Atari running his game's name into the ground? Money probably Probably just not interested in tangling with any legal shit. Unnecessary stress Yeah, where does Infogrames fit into all this?
 I have no idea. I was one of the people laid off when "Atari" started fucking with us so I don't know what happened to the code. 

I've never seen a game producer and a company owner cry openly before because of layoffs. I was almost able to turn it into a job at Cryptic, but they only had entry level positions at the time and wouldn't have been able to afford living in Oakland on what they were offering.  My hatred of Infogrames / Atari is old and deep. My clan and I destroyed the Australian servers. Good times. The low population meant that a half-decent group of organised people could just roll the maps each reset.

We rolled the maps. People stopped showing up to the port battles because they couldn't win, so our guys started to get bored. Some leaders re-rolled to the British side (we were French) in an effort to invigorate competition, but eventually we left and the Australian servers hobbled a long a little longer, then died.

I still consider those couple months the best MMO, and possibly best gaming, of my life. My regular gaming group, who mostly plays DotA, are still mostly guys I met playing that game. One of the other leaders, I know, went on to EvE with one of the pirate clans (we were on pretty good terms with the pirates.) He eventually become a dev for CCP from the back of those EvE efforts. It was released (taken off early access) earlier this year and was getting crushed by negative reviews and users screaming to wait another 6 months to release it because it was not ready. Apparently so many negative reviews that the developers actually put the game back on 'early access' status. It's still listed as an 'early access' game until Wednesday, and then it will be 're-released' with a short marketing campaign and no game fixes to be found. Looks like a cash grab for a POS imitation of RCT. Why didn't you refund it? >- My guests spent 10 days on a roller coaster and still thought it was fun.

I think I can safely speak for those of us at r/rollercoasters and say that is not a bug.  i never got on the hate train that fans of the first 2 had going for rtc3, I only played 2 and 3, and 3 was honestly my favorite. Scenarios were challenging, custom coasters were amazing, adding my own music was amazing, the expansions were like a 7/10 and an 8/10. They have a discord server with the devs in it, if you wanna go talk to them >My guests spent 10 days on a roller coaster and still thought it was fun.

I guess they didn't want to get off Mr Bone's Wild Ride... > My guests spent 10 days on a roller coaster and still thought it was fun.

made me think of:

*I want to get off Mr Bones' Wild Ride*

*I want to get off Mr Bones' Wild Ride*

*I want to get off Mr Bones' Wild Ride*

*I want to get off Mr Bones' Wild Ride* Sorry, couldn't have* Just putting a /s here so no one actually buys either of these games. The game is a lot more fun if you assume you win when you find a pit. If they made a zoo tycoon that looked like that i would be so happy You're right, I'm giving them too much credit. We need more companies that do that. I don't know, it's definitely a better game but it's not the same concept. Cities skylines doesn't scratch the same itch, sure you can build a beautiful city but the management aspect of the game is shallow at best so it's more of a city building game instead of a city management game, I just want a sim city 4 with better graphics and improved simulation :( I agree. That's kind of the point of bundling something new with old things. You get to try the new thing for a lower price and if you hate it you still have the old things and the price usually evens out. When the best thing about your theme park simulation game is WATER, there's not much to look forward too. You should add this to the post via an edit - it will give a lot of credibility. My first reaction after reading this was "I definitely can believe it given the state big companies have been releasing games, but how do I know this isn't just some fanboy talking?"

Also - thank you for taking the time to warn the gaming public about this, we HAVE to find a way to fight back against pre orders and releasing unfinished games. Just wanna say it's unfair to put in Unity and trying to associate it with only bad games. Remember, some really fun and really good games were also built with Unity. (Superhot, Desktop Dungeons, Jazzpunk, Enter the Gungeon, Kerbal Space Program and even fucking Hearthstone runs on Unity.) Yes, a lot of really shitty games are made with Unity, thoroughly debasing the engine's name, but just remember that just because something is made in Unity doesn't mean it'll automatically be shit. He's talking about RCT here Aha, makes sense! Planet Coaster was one of the more surprising titles I've seen in alpha. I was glad to learn it was the RCT guys.  The parks people have put together have been amazing. I'm excited to see what people can do with the full release as well how the campaign system falls out.  To give you an idea of it,
There's a hell of a lot of customization. From designing how the entrance looks, to being able to build entire strcutures.
Coaster building is extremely smooth and even auto-tunnels.
The terraforming is more like 3D-modeling. You can literally make an entire cave surrounding the theme park.
Ride enjoyment factors in the surrounding enviroment and terrain.
Guests will actually bump into eachother on paths instead of having no collision.
 Look up Parkitect as well. Goes more back to RCT1 and 2 days in terms of style instead of RCT3. Still technically in early access but it's still more full function that the poor excuse for a game that RCT Worlds is and it an incredible game, still in active development (unlike so many other early access titles). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et6CgCaCpoE 

Here's a video showing how many things you can customize. played the alpha, if you like RCT3, be prepared to jizz. it isn't perfect, but it also isn't out yet. If you want to see the depth of the game, check out some of [Silvarret's](https://www.youtube.com/user/Silvarret/videos) videos. He's a crazy talented builder. Also, if it interests you, Nerd^3 just started a LP series on it, though you'll have to also be interested in the meticulous activity of placing small objects. Don't do it, you'll get lost in the possibilities. You should definitely watch NerdCubed's video on the games. He gave himself a 30 minute timer to make a park based on one specific ride in the 3 Theme Park games being released. 

https://youtu.be/ZVUa58oY0T0

Planet Coaster was by far the most impressive It's amazing. The big feature is the customisation. To build a shop, you take a basic 4m by 4m by 4m cube and start applying things to it. The cube is the actual shop, you don't need to do anything to make it work but fuck, is it satisfying to turn it into a sci-fi masterpiece. Or a Disney style fairytale castle. Or a western tavern. There's so much you can do.  Check out this video for a great comparison of the three theme park games happening currently: 
[Nerd³ Plays... The Great Big Coaster Showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVUa58oY0T0) Just finished a long session, making an entire decrepit Lovecraftian town. I spent hours building and haven't even put a ride in this park yet, lol. It's like they took RCT3 and gave it an ass blasting of polish.  Frontier is a really great company. They created the game Elite: Dangerous as well that gets consistent updates. They seem (IMO at least) to really want to improve their games for customers.  Try parkitect i bought it last week and im hooked. Just going to reiterate to take a look at Parkitect.

Planet Coaster is RCT3-2, Parkitect is RCT1-3. No. Parkitect or Open RCT2 would be better you wont regret it Yes, it's real, and amazing You should check out Nerdcubed's videos on it. He really goes into detail with the things you can do (He started on the alpha and made another video everytime a bit update came out.) He's just started a completes series on the nearly finished Beta too. Can confirm. Am real, do play. Beta just launched a few days ago for people who pre ordered. It's seriously amazing, haven't had this much fun since RCT3 came out. There's still work to be done but in its current state it's already fantastic and the devs have been amazing. They even got a bunch of BIG features in before release when everyone thought there was no way in hell. The beta came out last Thursday so I figured I would give it a shot.  I've called off work every day since Thursday until today because I was so hooked.  I'm seeing it in my dreams.  I've never been sucked into a game like this before.  Words can't describe how awesome it is.  You should look up some famous streamers on YouTube to get a taste of the sheer amount of customization and how powerful the world building tools are in this game. 

Also, the developers (Frontier) is the same company that made Rollercoaster Tycoon 1, 2, and 3.  They have the most experience in theme park management games than any other studio and it really shows in this game.  It really is awesome. I'd still wait until reviews come out, rather than preordering. Steam is warning about a form of DRM, and it will be good to make sure that it doesn't ruin the game in any way. They're also behind Thrillville, the Coaster Crazy app, and etc. Well, Frontier have reserved the name "Planet Safari"... Last time I downloaded a hardcore zoo game I got a shit-ton of viruses. Not worth it. If I remember correctly, Frontier has already trademarked 'Planet Safari'. They've already mentioned how they want to create a franchise, so you may be in luck. Be prepared to drop guests into the lion pits Not in my experience at all. More like how Ubisoft operated, though I think they're also changing.  SimTower was/is awesome to play.  Also SimEarth, loved that game. Why did Sim Ant never gain a following? :( Yeah, a good one. I hear the latest one was a huge disappointment. I'd love a hardcore zoo game. Base game could have at least 100 species. Instead of just fenced areas, there could be a bigger variety of exhibit types. Aviaries, seapens, small animal exhibits. I have a ten page word document on all of the features I want to see in a zoo game... And make it more zoo tycoon 1, not like weird zoo tycoon 2.  I played the one that came out for xbox 360. It was slightly interesting, but mostly crap. Still prefer the original version the most. The planet coaster guys also trademarked planet safari, so fingers crossed! I think Frontier recently announced they are working on it. Skylines is great but it seems to be missing the sort of "heart" earlier SimCity games had. Skylines is pretty emotionless, I never get the feeling that people like or love what I'm doing or have any vested interest in what I'm plopping down. I remember in SC3K people would be demanding I build more zoos, protesting me legalizing gambling, or complaining about over funding of things like the police force when there was no crime in the city. The only thing Skylines has going for it in that sort of direction is I can build a football stadium and watch people stream into and out of it once ever few weeks. I know I'll get a lot of dissent for it, but I personally prefer Simcity 2013 to Cities Skylines, C:S is a great game but it just isnt for me :/ EA acquiring Maxis really hurt. They had so many great sim games. But EA just wanted SimCity and The Sims and let all the other franchises die.

I'll never forget playing SimFarm and SimTower for hours and hours :( I want SimCopter redone so baddddd No one seems to have learned from the E.T. fiasco. But... But... It's needed for *cloud computing*!

Until it suddenly isn't anymore. Check out the reviews of Anno 2070 - an excellent game. Mostly negative reviews because you're forced to use UPlay, which frequently locks genuine players out claiming they have a counterfeit copy, and for many other reasons is a pain to use. Everyone one did. The DLC that fixed the ending is free. What was so bad about it they had to apologize? I still hate EA over Simcity to this day and will never buy a game from them again (and never have since) > but the damn casinos kept dipping into the severe red for no reason.

Sir, you really should be using this time to prepare for leading the country. If you really think it's not better than the first bunch of SimCity games, all I can say is that you're entitled to your opinion. And that I think that opinion is crazy.


Sim City 4, maybe. Because of mods. *Any* of the earlier Sim City games? Crazy. I still prefer SimCity 4's gameplay to skylines. 

Skyline is great; expansive, complex, but less fun for me.  Soooooooo I'll be the first to ask

Can we still build concentration camps or is this going to be frowned upon?  [deleted] K, sounds like Parkitect is for me, then. I never really gave a shit about building coasters, I just wanted to make the most money. RCT1&2 had awesome business aspects that you don't really see much anymore.

Are there other "business simulator" type games out there worth playing? I wouldn't say "less emphasis on customers" for PC. The simulation is pretty deep. Each guest has it's own unique brain with different needs and wants. They created an entirely unique language that they speak and the management options are incredibly deep right now in Beta.  Parkitect is definitely more focused on that but it's selling point is it's a park simulation game for under $20 while PC is a fully featured theme park design and management studio.   I really wish the Parkitect devs made an importer for the MASSIVE existing collection of RCT2/RCT3 rides out there.

But overall I'm really impressed with the Parkitect team. This is outdated.

For example: There are very powerful Terrain tools in Planet Coaster now. "This is probably going to be one of those games where they say *Oh! It's finished now!* and it's still just a buggy mess." - Re: RCTW

\#Prophecy While this is a good start for comparison it's worth noting there's been 7 months worth of development for all 3 games since the video was published. I love his love of rocks Need cubed is the shit! Also in the case of RCT3, put First Aid stations near the exit of the rides. Chris is a bit of a recluse, he basically never talks to journalists or the public, but he did an interview here where he does talk about RCT4 and RCTW http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-03-a-big-interview-with-chris-sawyer-the-creator-of-rollercoaster-tycoon
 Infogrames bought the name from Hasbro, renamed GT Interactive to Atari Inc, and then merged Atari and Infogrames into what it is today.
 Somewhere in the middle, I lost track.  so what are you doing now, if you don't mind me asking. > no game fixes to be found

So... aren't they just going to get more negative reviews? sonsabitches. They got me. They got me good.  I'm dying with laughter 😂

I suddenly imagined people just sitting on a stationary rollercoaster overnight repeatedly screaming "Weeeee! Woohoo!"  😂😂😂 I didn't play enough RCT3 to form an opinion, it came out around the same time as MGS3 so it just flew under the radar for me. Well, Planet Coaster has everything you just mentioned. I was/am a huge fan of RCT3, and I've been following RCT World and Planet Coaster since their announcements, and honestly Planet Coaster is essentially what RCT4 should have been, where as RCT World is a shitty last attempt at milking the RCT brand. 

>the expansions were like a 7/10 and an 8/10.

The expansions were great, but are you saying you liked *Wild!* (2nd expansion) better than *Soaked!* (the 1st)?! Well Frontier, who made RCT3 is making Planet Coaster, so if that says anything....    
&nbsp;    
As a BIG fan of RCT1, RCT2, and lesser extent RCT3 (not cause I didn't like but more so it came out during a busy time in my life and didn't really get to get into it) Planet Coaster is god damn amazing!  Just unbelievable what you can do in it and it just oozes charm all over (hire a Coaster King mascot and try not to smile as he entertains guests).  Just check out /r/planetcoaster and see the incredible things people are making in the beta right now (comes out on Thursday) It actually was Mr. Bone's Wild Ride, you can find it in the workshop  Don't apologize and don't ever stop. You got me:'[ Their next game is apparently called Planet Safari. So we might get just that. I think everyone and their uncle has owned the name at some point in the past 30 years Yeah you're right it is unfair to describe unity as a bad platform based on bad games.  And a lot of great games have come out of unity. I will remove that from my comment, thank you. Ah, sorry.  Thought he was talking about Planet Coaster. if planet coaster gets VR First person views on their rides its over Have they put in any of the management aspects yet? The game looks real pretty and the building mechanics look polished, but the last time I looked into the game, they hadn't put the management gameplay in, and that was a concern for me. The one thing that hooked me about Planet Coaster (other than the devs, of course) was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-ODtILmVOY).

They sure know their core audience. >Guests will actually bump into eachother on paths instead of having no collision.

But can they see each other? Can you still kill you guest?  Can my HD4000 graphics run it? Sorry in advance to any pcmasterracers (pcmasterracists sounded kinda off...) I promise I'll get an rx 480 eventually         

Edit: [nevermind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cApWe36ihvQ) fails even from Argentina How fucking great is it that not only are theme park games coming back, but we actually have multiple *styles* of theme park game to choose from again. Great time to be a person who grew up on RCT. I love Parkitect so much! I fuckin knew it. He literally spent 40 minutes building a cave, destroying it and putting lights in.

*And I watched it.*

*And I loved it.* That's pretty incredible. This dude is a wizard.  I would say his videos are by far the most impressive.  And I love he explains his reasoning behind every decision; he does an excellent job of letting the viewer into his mindset.  I started playing the beta tonight and somehow spent 3 hours decorating ONE RIDE. I've never been that sucked into a management style game before. +1 for Parkitect if you like the old isometric RCT. 

Basically, if you liked RCT3, get Planet Coaster.
If you liked RCT1/2, get Parkitect.
If you like suicidal thoughts, then just kill yourself instead of getting RCTW. I won't regret the "fuck you" but the game isn't my type of game. I may give it to my brother.  He also made a good video comparing the three park games coming out: Planet Coaster, Roller Coaster Tycoon World, and Parkitect. They were still in beta at the time though, and I know PC and Parkitect have added a lot since then, but RCTW is still shit. Yeah, probably would be a good idea.  Especially if, for whatever reason, you don't have constant network connectivity when you're going to game; Denuvo is known to require online reactivation any time your system hardware changes.   Damn Thrillville was my favorite game back in the day and now Elite is. I had no idea they were made by the same company Elite: Dangerous as well thrillville was amazing, never played the sequel 

a new thrillville with proper psvr marketing behind it would be a gamechanger for vr IMO Thrillvill 2 was a great game It's probably just going to be an extension for Planet Coaster since there was one for RCT3. ... In that case, I really, really hope Planet Coaster succeeds! If you loved SimTower, you should look into Project Highrise. Some things are simplified (no micromanaging elevators, for instance), and mostly replace hotel rooms with apartments, but for me at least it feels like a good spiritual successor, a la Cities: Skylines for SimCity. There's a wonderful Yoot Tower reimagining called [Project Highrise](http://store.steampowered.com/app/423580/) that while different in some aspects, perfectly scratches the itch.  For some reason, playing Sim Ant as a kid made me think that a Sim Body game would be awesome. Like, you have to control all the different organs, fight infections, heal wounds and broken bones. That kind of thing. Because it was fracking hard. no kdding, sim ant was so much fun back in the day.
 I always wanted another Sim Copter. Man I used to love playing that game, flying around rescuing sims and putting out fires, getting the Apache and going on rampages round the city! Good times! And certain actual zoos will be in the system so you can follow the history of say San Francisco Zoo or just take over it or something :) I never played Zoo Tycoon 1 but I played a *lot* of 2 as a kid and I loved it. How were they different? I totally know what you mean by the heart earlier games had. 

Something just never got me hooked with Skylines, and I think some of that has to do with all the life sucked out of it. In Simcity you'd find a lot of humor inserted everywhere and things felt gamey. Skylines doesn't give the same feel. With C:S everything just felt so empty. Like, once I figured out a layout that worked it felt like I was just repeating the same thing over and over to grow the city for no reason. You can hit a point where everything is stable and there's no reason to go back to it. They're very different. SimCity is more of a game, and Cities Skylines is more of a sandbox art project.

Now if only we could combine the best of both games... Its an almost unprecedented creation engine... attached to an extremely flawed and limited 'game'. You can make some truly breathtaking cities with it but there's pretty much no fundamental point when the game systems are fudged anyway. You know what? I can respect that. C:S is very design heavy and, outside of the traffic simulation element, there isn't a lot going on to make it a fully-featured game, per se. You can make some gorgeous cities, though.

I haven't played it for a while, but I have a lot of fun trying to figure out how to build a traffic-friendly city that still makes sense from a realistic and practical perspective. EA did a shit job on Sims 4 too. Sims 3 is still the best out of all the games. I own 3 with like 4 expansions. I also own 4 and I have yet to see an expansion that I want. It has a few parts that are interesting but it doesn't compare to 3. I also have sims 3 and pets for xbox 360. I used to be a huge sims fan but EA destroyed it. That reminds me, I don't know if anyone else would remember this game; but I used to love playing Streets of Sim City. The game had terrible graphics, and the controls were comically terrible, but man did I burn up the hours playing that game. Which was great, because at the time you could build your city in SimCity 2000 and then play it in SOSC. And IIRC it was the last full game that Maxis released independently before EA acquired them. Easily one of my favorites from the entire SimCity series.    That's giving Maxis too much credit.

They didn't come up with SimTower, they just relabeled someone else's game and all the other SimName games weren't very financially successful. EA bought Maxis because they were in financial trouble, not because they were at the height of their popularity. 

In all likelyhood you'd never have seen The Sims, Spore, or SC3k/SC4 at all under Maxis if EA hadn't bought them, they'd just have gone under.

The Sims was also developed entirely under EA's ownership.

-----------

Oft mourned Westwood is a similar story, they didn't get bought because they were high-flying, they got bought because they were going to go under otherwise and EA thought they were worth picking up. I remember that whole debacle, really pathetic at the same. Fixed is highly subjective. I feel I was the only one that didn't really mind the ending. Like it wasn't good but it didn't put me off and still enjoyed the whole series as a whole.

But I do see why not many liked it. The original ending was literally the same cutscene with three different colors over it. No explanation, full of plot holes and 0 closure. I think the "control" (blue) ending had a slight change one section of the scene, but that was it. 

Forgot to mention, it was also a literal Deus Ex Machina. After spending 5 years making choices to build my own path, it was a massive letdown  The entire plot of the series is basically made meaningless by a deus ex machina that is *literally* a god from the machine.  Stay strong brother. It's sad when I don't even consider madden as an option anymore.  I learned my lesson and haven't pre-ordered any game since Simcity 2013. For simcity? I hated them when they came out with that abomination known as Command And Conquer 4 and then when they promised generals 2 then changed there mind to what ever fucking crap they came out to replace it I have the same policy for both EA and Ubisoft. I hate what Ubi did with Heroes of Might and Magic. Simcity 4 was the pinnacle of life for me. It even made me blindly buy SimCity Societies and then Sim City 2013. I played Societies I think for 22 min, and Sim City 2013 for 5 buggy hours... lost my save and said fuck it. Haven't touched it since. 

All is want is a more indepth/polished SimCity 4 with mod support and huge fucking maps. That's all i want.  I agree. I love sim city 3000. I still play it. But, I grew up with it. Cities skylines is a phenomenal game. I have a lot of fun with it.

Rose tinted glasses obscures vision sometimes.

Also, dig your user name. At least in my opinion as a long time player, Cities Skylines is way easier than the old Simcity games. Don't get me wrong it is still fun, but not as complicated and hard as Simcity 4. For example in Simcity 4 road congestion lead to car crashes, and people getting pissed at you quickly. The point is that Skylines is just an average city builder, it brings nothing new to the genre. Technically it's very good, but the game itself gets old surprisingly fast. Hell, even Cities XL felt fresher than Skylines even though technically it sucks balls. Yes. You're right, it was based off earlier builds as my interest died off.  I'm glad to hear planet coaster is improving. 

Honestly if what you're saying is accurate I'm definitely buying it  The OpenRCT2 team may end up making it easy, since were moving to out own save formats - So it in theory shouldn't be too hard for Parkitect to add support. Of course, this is a long way off still, but yah. He just started a "completes" of Planet Coaster where he goes in depth with the final release version of the game for anyone interested. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcLIKL0gQgg If you haven't watched his videos before, he's great. He just started his Planet Coaster Completes series. He's also done a RCT3 one where he went until the game could no longer handle it. He's honestly my favorite YouTuber. /r/nerdcubed Just wait till you see his love of the lighting engine. Prepare for hours of a man obsessing over lamp placements! (And yet I still watch every video....) Him on RTC: "Social Hub? Let's never press that one." This is still the case with Planet Coaster. First Aid 'cures' nausea.  I think in RCT2 bathrooms do the same thing I hadn't heard about RCT2 coming to mobile!  I just found RCT3 for mobile a few weeks back and wished it was 2 instead.  Playing 2 on an iPad on the go would be incredible.  Thanks for posting this interview.  He rode 657! coasters? Impressive I worked in tech for a while longer, but 2 years ago I decided that if I was going to be a good socialist that I needed to stop making assholes rich. I quit and started working for a local NPO that provides permanent housing for chronically homeless people in Seattle. I am a live in "assistant manager" and love my job :) Eating pussy and kickin ass, obviously! No. Contrary to this thread they've done quite a bit of work to fix it up. It's by no means perfect or Planet Coaster like but it's a semi-decent park builder now.

Rollercoaster Tycoon seems like a mobile game - it's latest dev team have never worked on a PC game before they were exclusively mobile. Planet Coaster is the more fully featured PC game. If you only played twenty min you could have returned it? wasn't trying to imply order, soaked is the 8 Wouldn't surprise me. Passed around like the town bike. Everyone's had a ride on it. It is made in the COBRA Engine, the same engine as Elite: Dangerous; it is more than VR capable.  Here is hoping.  

In the meantime there is NoLimits 2 which is more of a Rollercoaster Simulator and design suite that is now VR capable.  That's why I always liked Sim Coaster the best, because you could ride the rides. The only thing I disliked about RCT games was how juvenile and campy the food stands looked. I don't want my lemonade stand to look like a fucking lemon.

Also, they needed to include 'carnival games' and better first-person views in the flat rides (esp. gravitron and tilt-a-whirl) NoLimits 2 is better if you want to ride coasters in VR. 

Planet Coaster is great, but the banks and transitions in PCs coasters can be a little janky and jerky. Yes! The Beta is out and it has scenarios and a campaign which are both focused on the management part! [I previewed *Planet Coaster* for TechRaptor.net](https://techraptor.net/content/planet-coaster-preview) and am currently working on my review.

The management gives you a *lot* of detail, but there are a few frustrating elements in it. There are things you have to micromanage  that should be able to be handled by broader policy options that aren't there.

As an example, research allows you to pick up to three rides to research from a pool. You can manage how much money you put per research project. However, once it's complete you have to manually click on it and start a new one. It's better than the old *RCT* games (well, the first two anyway - I never played the third one) in that it lets you research multiple things at the same time. It's also worse in that research just doesn't complete automatically.

There's also an issue of management with the staff. Staff have two important things you can set - wages, and training. You train them up a level (Starting at 1 by default and ending at 5) and they get better at their jobs. When they get better trained, you typically bump up their salary a bit until they are happy with their job. Now, these things follow a pretty straightforward pattern; for example, all of my Level 5 Janitors at at $200/month. Unfortunately, you also have to do this manually. I feel this element is another bit of unnecessary micromanagement.

Those are my two complaints about actual management. Now, as for the data they give you? Hoo boy. You get demographics data (families/teens/adults), spending data, graphs... it's pretty nuts. You're awfully well informed. There's even heatmaps that tell you which bits of a ride are "working" (exciting/not exciting, nauseating/not nauseating) and which bits do not.

So yes, micromanagement problems do exist but they're not huge headaches overall. Just a bit annoying, I suppose. I think it's a good spiritual successor to *RCT* overall. It's by no means perfect, but it's a good start. There's trillions of opportunities. And can they get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride? It doesn't look like anything to me.
 Yep, last patch added it. Sadly no, at least not as far as I can tell. A ride needs to be successfully tested before you can open it which means it needs to not crash horribly. However, you can test while building the coaster so you can murderise crash dummies over and over and over and over.  I would honestly be surprised if you couldn't. When I first go my 3570k with the intel HD 4000, I was able to play Farcry 3 on low to medium settings if I remember correctly. It wasn't the prettiest but it was playable. There's only two games (RCTW doesn't count) so it's not exactly a trend, but both games look great so I'm happy! I tried planet coaster for 30 minutes, it's a big complex game for an oldie such as myself.  Definitely seems like something to spend a lot of time on. This is the kind of stuff I love from N^3. I found him when he did the rct3 build series. His creative series seem so much less stressing and he seems to enjoy them more than the completes type series.  He would make me want to play a game called Planet Lovely Caves. I'm sold. I was about to play some Rimworld that I've been ignoring all week, but you reminded me that my pirate cove in PC needs a few more touches. If I never played 3, what sets it apart from 1/2 so much? One of these things is not *quite* like the others. A damn good, albeit hard as fuck, game. I flew my ship once in Elite: Dangerous, true story. [deleted] Elevators were the fun part, they took that away and added some much more boring micro in it's place. Somebody get on this I'd play it. The trick is to dig down to the holes that send you into the Red Ant's colony.  Once in sneak up and attack the queen until it dies.  Once done, you can start stealing eggs back to your colony (if they hatch in your area they will be black ants).  Now you have the advantage in that they won't have any new ants born after awhile. Was I just an amazing gamer as a child? I remember wrecking shit every time. I have no such skills now. SimEarth? What was hard about it? Change playable character to spider. Eat all the ants. Simple. Nah it wasn't once you figure it out.

In your colony, of you dig deep, there is a back door to the Red colony.  Use this and throw ants at their queen early early.  Once she is dead you go full defence until you build an army and crush the remaining reds.

Then you start colonizing the yard and house until the humans are dead.

Alternately, place rocks in a wall around the enemy nest, they are too stupid to move them and will become trapped and starve to death.

If you place one rock on the hole, they will make a new hole, so make a wall.  

Red is dumb, Black superior. I was thinking it would be cool for a zoo game to partner with real life zoos and aquariums to release DLC. Like, a San Francisco Zoo DLC pack would feature structures and species unique to the zoo, and maybe even a pre-built zoo designed to resemble it as closely as possible. Zoo Tycoon 1 felt like a business management game, which I liked. Zoo Tycoon 2 felt more like a kid's game with little challenge, more focus being put on playing with the animals. I did love first person mode in Zoo Tycoon 2 though. It's been a while since I played Zoo Tycoon 2, but I think the difference was managing a zoo in the first, and building a zoo in the second. I played both and love both, but the second is too cartoonish and had a few bugs, the first one was more mature and better polished

Besides the second looks so obscure while the first is always colorful I remember I got a lot of flak on the C:S subredsit for asking whether it had actually become a game a year or two after release as opposed to the "city designer" it was at release. I'm glad someone agrees.

In the end I never actually received any response to my question, just insults from the community. My guess was it hadn't changed and I guess it still hasn't even now. After Sims 3 being open world I was wondering how much they can improve on the technology with upcoming hardware. Turns out they didn't and went backwards so that shit hardware can run the game. I guess they had to cater to the crowd who's computer is old and/or most likely infected with malware and couldn't load Sims 3 in under 10 minutes. I think Sims 4 is fun as a "simulator", but not as a sandbox like Sims 3 was. The problem is Sims 4 was developed by the Sims 2 development team (essentially the original Maxis dev team) and that team wanted to get away from the memory issues and huge load times for the state machine used in Sims 3. I really wish they'd done a compromise, though, and at least done a state machine for each neighborhood and a little better control of each Sim, even if not watching them. By that, I mean if you control 4 Sims and two need to do homework and one work prep for the next day, the other one can't go out partying with friends unless everyone follows you to that lot. Just allowing them to do those things "off camera" would work wonders for playing anything more than a Sim or two, which is all I've ever been able to do with that game. Sims 3 was developed by a studio I think EA set up because the Maxis team was tied up with Spore. The Maxis team did contribute World Adventures, one of the first expansion packs and I really liked the direction that one went in. That and University Life got me to play the game again, all the others I bought I got bored of within a few days (Seasons was maybe the most interesting of the rest). The only way to fix the ending is to turn it off when you see the Deux Ex Machina and make up your own ending.  The new ending was still better than the original three options.  I thought the way the game ended (with the DLC) with the renegade option being the "right" option very fitting. Most people tried to play as a paragon, but Mass Effect 3 shows you that your perception can be altered (indoctrination) and the choices that seem like the "good" choices are actually the wrong choices Well, the front didn't fall off - so they have that going for them. I know I'm being annoying but could you go into more detail, or do you have a link that explains what you mean? I've never played any of those games, but I'm interested in what made so many people universally hate the ending  Madden became a piece of crap when it started with the Ultimate team. It's now a pay to play card collecting game first and football game second. I'm not sure why people like that so much. I guess people like be sucker out of money now in days.  Still not bored of cities skylines thanks to mods. Seriously they just keep getting better and better. Cities XL had so much potential in my eyes. They already had the sheer scale, it's a shame the devs couldn't get their act together and build an engine that would use more than *one fucking thread*

I could run Cities XL 2011 on a fucking Prescott Pentium 4 about as well as my i7 2600 could, it's ridiculous.

source: friend gave me a P4 based system for free The fact that an average, certainly not bad but far from great city builder dominates the market should say something about the genre. Still, I'm happy for the developers, I like pdox and their associates. Going to hijack this thread to welcome people to join us at /r/PlanetCoaster! We are super hyped about what they have coming and the beta!

EDIT: Maybe not the best thread to hijack, but hey, I ain't going to stop you from building what ever your evil mind thinks of.  Holy shit that game is pretty. Say what you like, that cave looks swish as hell now. RCT 2 had first aid rooms as well The guys behind Open RCT2 are looking at bringing it to mobile as well. They post update images on /r/rct every now and again When Frontier was asked about VR support for Planet Coaster, they said it was possible, but because of hardware limitations, they aren't planning on adding VR support at that time. Welp, my gamer boner is engaged.

Just gotta go track my wallet down, and fish it out of the corner it is hiding in. Kinda disappointed PC doesn't support NVidia 3d Vision. Was that the game where if you went off the rails, it showed the coaster flying through the air? I can't remember if there were arms flailing, but that was half the fun as a kid.  You can ride the rides in Planet Coaster as well
 But that's how lemonade stands at parks look in real life :/ So i guess you will like Planet Coaster then.
The stand itself is just a cubelike building, but you have a special toolset to model the building you want. My toilet block looks like a little castle! (Throne room, you know?) I hated how any attempt to make a sick ride scared everyone off and they wouldnt ride it. Fuck you i live by Cedar pint and you mean to tell me a 200 foot drop is too scary for you? That's good to hear. I was worried the simulation aspect was going to take a backseat to a pretty, but shallow experience. Maybe I'll pick it up with some of my holiday money. No man's walkway Already on the steam workshop for Planet Coaster. Doesn't look like anything to me            
^sorry ^mind ^still ^blown What door?  Too soon! It doesn't look like anything to me. They added it in a month or so ago :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBcNp9NrJg0&feature=youtu.be It's just not the same, dammit. 3D For me, the management aspects and UI were much worse than RCT1 and 2. It also ran like shit on computers back then. I think RCT3 was more popular with people who like decorating parks in great detail, but I'm a management/coaster builder type. Elite is simple. First, you need to graduate with a doctors in Newtonian physics, then you gently lift off, and raise your landing gear... And some guy in a conda just boosted into you. The initial learning curve is really, really steep and they don't give you much guidance at all so you're basically thrown right into it. Once you get the hang of it though it's really fun. Just remember the golden rule: don't fly what you can't rebuy!!! (if you die you have to pay 5% of the cost of your ship + modules in insurance order to "rebuy" it, otherwise you lose your ship and get put back into the entry level ship for the game) Then you'll love [Elevator Saga](http://play.elevatorsaga.com/)! Sim tower was an elevator simulator that git turned into a game. If you're into that kind of thing, I'd also suggest A-Train 3D: City Simulator. I've got the one on 3DS, and you build train lines, but you end up getting super complex and micro managing train speeds and arrivals down to the second. Only takes one train on the wrong track or behind schedule to screw up 30 other trains you set up. Surprisingly deep strategy and planning. I'm already on it. Right now I'm working on the puberty levels. Gonna be sweeeeet And this is why I love gaming. 100 years has passed since the game came out and we're still trading tips.

Edit: DYAC I dunno, I tried playing it again a while back, and I really struggled with the graphics and the user interface. I think I enjoyed and was good at that game because I didn't have many other options.

Would I pay $14.99 if a reputable team wanted to rebuild it with a decent UI and modernized graphics? Sure! I think SimAnt has some really interesting mechanics that could be fleshed out for a unique RTS experience. 

It's mostly colony management, but your drones have a lot of autonomy. You have to keep a careful eye on supply line logistics, constantly scout for limited non renewable resources. Your drones will fuck up, they will get killed by the boatload. Large predators stalk the landscape and could in moments wipe an entire supply chain. The game could play in real time, giving players benefits and risks to consider depending on the time of day. 

Basically, think a Settlers game, but instead of being a king of a human society you're the hivemind for the Zerg.  Yeah I don't recall it being too difficult. Certainly a bit challenging for a 10 year old, but nothing significant.

I heard that Unnatural selection was even harder. I beat that as a kid as well. Best game ever when I was a kid. I spent so much money renting that game from the video store.  There was both a campaign and sandbox mode in zoo tycoon 2. As a kid I exclusively played sandbox, would be able to make the entire zoo into a jungle or an ocean reef. I wouldn't want that to be taken away.  I have a crappy computer and I can load sims 3 just fine. Only problem that I have now is that I had to change my password for Origin after someone hacked my account and now I can't log into my sims server. It's frustrating. So instead I play on my xbox 360 as I have sims 3 and sims 3 pets for that system. I was always hoping they would release sims 4 for console but i'ts looking more and more like that will never happen. I have an msi 16 gb ram nividia 860m. Tried sims 3 it still runs like shit with all the expansions in.  Crashes constantly even sims 2 runs better than sims 3 while it's a good game it was coded so poorly and littered with bugs EA never fixed.  I will always subscribe to the indoctrination theory. So perfect. Head canon is best canon.

Indoctrination theory 4 life The worst part of that is it is literally a god from the machine. Marauder Shields. Never forget. o7 And at least we got that.  Most game companies would have looked at the money they'd already gotten, shrugged their shoulders, and ignored the players.

*I'm looking at you, No Man's Sky.* The TV Tropes entry for "Deus Ex Machina" did a great job at making a short answer for this, actually:

"Played almost preposterously straight in the ending of Mass Effect 3, to the rage of a huge portion of the fanbase. In the final minutes, a completely un-foreshadowed entity appears that essentially tells you what endings you have to choose between. Unlike virtually every other major decision in the game, its highly questionable logic can't be examined, Shepard just accepts its conclusions and moves on. It somehow has the power to affect every living creature in the galaxy and none of its abilities are ever justified in any serious way, which is particularly infuriating in a series that previously had meticulous and plausible explanations for all of its sci-fi tech."

Also worth noting is that the series was hugely based on making choices that will later have consequences. The 3 ending choices are not affected by anything.  [Try this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M0Cf864P7E) Strange choice of thread to hijack..  Welcome concentration camp lovers! That's probably the worst comment to pitch on but now I'm sold.  Uhhhhh.....

/r/PlanetCoaster concentration camp subreddit confirmed Couldn't someone mod it into the game? I'm not too clued up on the technical aspect of how doing something like that would work. I'm not, 3D is a silly gimmick.  I'd rather devs spend time on other things beside 3D support. Probably  thrillvile off the rails. This park was a mistake. what a time to be alive /r/Westworld is leaking I cry everytiem. Do the guests actually die though? Or do they just get up and walk it off.  That was the best thing I've see all day It might be possible however to create a ride with G forces that can and will kill a human being. I have no idea if that sort of thing affects the meeple but if it does, you might have your death machine.  Then I'd go with parkitect, it has more managment, for example you have to build back areas of your park like corridors and rec rooms for staff and  trash systems for getting trash out of your park instructions unclear: Elon is sending me to mars [longest yeah boy ever] May I interest you in Dwarf Fortress.

Graphics wise though, how do you feel about literally no graphics? You can mod it to "more understandable but still literally no graphics" though. Oh, god, you were the other guy?? Is it perfect? The official and indoctrination endings both disregard any player choice in the end for what the writer/theorists want. It's like the hack of a writer learned that translation and thought it would be *perfect.* Not to mention that even though the Citadel DLC was something you had to pay for, at least it felt like a fitting send-off to the game. Having the last thing you do before the final mission be an awesome party with all of your favorite characters (minus the ones who died) was great. Perfect, thank you.  Yea... strange choice of threads to hijack here /u/GameSyns!!! ;) [deleted] well the computer has to be capable of maintaining 90FPS on ~~3~~ 2 screens (2 screens in the VR headset ~~+ the monitor~~) [most likely] outputting in HD Do you realise that one of the aspects that makes VR , VR.. is the stereoscopic display.. which is 3D! Shit 3D is a gimmick, great 3D is quietly brilliant. You won't notice it that much due to it being very natural, but turn it off and everything goes flat!

But yeah odd if it won't work for nv3d but works with vr, nv3d generally works for everything anyway? Odd Life.... uh.., finds a way. someone needs to make westworld in planet coaster


westworld DLC I like that this is your main factor for determining the games worth ;) Not without your Sol permit! > May I interest you in Dwarf Fortress.

Slow down Satan. Both games are amazing. SHIT, IT'S CHECKED OUT??? Sure, but indoc did it with stuff that was clearly setup and which you had been told about from pretty much game 1: The Reapers come and then everyone is fucked.

When I first got to the ending - before the fix - my initial reaction was: "Naah, this can't be it. I wouldn't choose any of those idiotic choices. They don't even make any sense. I'll have to shoot the kid"

So I shot the kid, which did nothing. And left the game for 5-10 minutes before coming back and choosing Red Ending (Which is obviously superior to blue or green!).

There was always the possibility that the game would end with there being no way to win. That was always the underlying threat. 

The only good thing about extended endings is, that now you can actually shoot the kid and get a "the cycle continued, but we left stuff behind for the next people " ending. I know people say, that it was a way for the developer to give the finger to whiny gamers, but it's my preferred ending by far! No it shows that despite the best efforts some things cannot be stopped then it tested the player on making the right choice. Destroy was the whole objective of the 3 games and the start child trys to convince you there is another way. Control is impossible due to reaper indoc and synthesis is what the Reapers were already doing abducting the colonies. Indoc theory gives shep and an extension the player what it feels like to have indoctrination be attempted. If the player fails to choose destroy the Reapers have effectively indoctrinated them breaking the 4th wall.  I'm annoyed this was dlc. I never played it because I didn't even hear about it, and I felt like once I did hear about it it was too expensive to bother getting.

Even when I got the total trilogy on my PS3 it came with all dlc besides the ME3 stuff cause they wanted money. I felt like that sendoff was owed to all the gamers who played hundreds of hours to get to that ending, a big party with all your friends was what I wanted to see before we went to our certain doom.

I'm still a bit butthurt that I wasn't just given this cool ending piece with the price of admission.  For the rollercoaster experience though, all you need is control over the point of view - beyond that it's on rails (hue)  I don't quite understand why it has to render 3 screens. I know the 2 in the headset are pretty vital (for most, I'd only need one) but the external monitor seems like a waste unless it's a spectator rig. And idk too much about software and drivers and all at that level, but couldn't you theoretically use the already rendered headset frame buffer and display the same images on the monitor with minimal overhead?

RemindMe! 12 hours Ask dev friend about VR Rendering Tricks Time to buy 3 1080's Is the monitor a 3rd render? I thought it just used one of the eyes not transformed for the headset Spared many expenses It appears there will be steam workshop support, so it's possible.
 Jokes on you, I have a Sirius permit! >Slow down

That sounds like Dwarf Fortress all right. But it's not following through with the main thing that makes Mass Effect special, it's choices and how it recognizes them like no other game did.

The indoc theory has none of that and plays out like any other "It was all a dream" theory from every other franchise on the planet. At first I thought the fuck up was the dude that belly crawled out of the elevator by himself as the door shut behind him.  Little did I know, that was the best decision anyone could have made in this situation. I find it so amazing how everyone turns and stares at him. I like how the dude that crawled out the door knew it was coming.

"I aint taking the elevator with Steve.Ima gtfo bye" The slow zoom in on his face kills me. Missing a grenade throw is one of the worst feelings in the world. http://i.imgur.com/6j1B6BB.gifv http://i.imgur.com/lIi2CcL.gifv I don't think I'd be able to finish the match. Not due to quitting, but because I'd be crying from laughter.  
  
Moments like these are better than any super-crazy no-scope quick kill kind of shit.  "What the fuck, Richard" [You Might like this: Squad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLRk6aWIKHg) Looks like a SovietWomble grenade fail it's even better with sound: https://youtu.be/UTfdSARj_q8?t=4m59s This needs one of those JoJo's Bizarre adventure cuts When you realized, you don't know how to use commas. How the fuck, do commas work? Not like this... *All around me are familiar faces...* I feel like the dog shit quality of this gif makes it better lmao If I had a dollar for every time this happened to me I'd have BF1 pre-purchased for free All I could hear was the Metal Gear Solid sound after being spotted when it zooms on the grenade.  That's some serious use of the Walken, comma. I have terrible problems understanding lifts. I can never work out which button is for closing the door, and which is for opening it. Even though they have arrows and everything. It's like I have a very specialized form of dyslexia, just for lifts.

So of course I avoid taking grenades into lifts whoever possible. *God damn it Carl!* Reminds me of the BFF season 4 trailer that parodied the "Only in battlefield" videos where Noob did the same thing and killed himself thinking there was an enemy in the elevator ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY!? I've always wished you could jump on grenades in FPS games to save everyone else nearby. Seems like a simple enough mechanic to work in.  What game, is this [To be continued...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G65pvuTFR_A) When you realized, you added a comma that really doesn't need to be there.

Send paramedics. Did anyone else hear the Metal Gear Solid alert sound in their heads when it zoomed in on the grenade? https://youtu.be/vLjBDB2lkiw What is up with your awful comma, usage? I really, found that, funny,.! HOLD THE DOOR This, is , perfect Another one of these faces: http://i.imgur.com/FPYctCo.mp4 Sound pls That's the "I love you look" the hero does to his family in disaster movies just as they die.  I'm glad this was caught on tape. Not, because it is fucking hilarious, and we all get to see it (which I still do appreciate), but because the guy that crawled away in the beginning will get to see what the fuck just happened. It'd be cool if battlefield and games like it allowed you to jump on a grenade to save the teammates in the killzone No matter how many times I watch it, it never stops being funny. What game is this? Did anyone else hear this while watching?
https://youtu.be/4N3N1MlvVc4 This reminds me of the time I was playing america's army.  Was AFK in spawn, got flashbanged, and I *knew* some fucker was going to waltz up and execute me.  I said 'fuck it', whipped out a grenade, pulled the pin and just *held it* (throwing it would make my character shout 'grenade' or some such).  Grenade went off and killed us both lol. So many comments so I'm sure this will be lost. Way back on call of duty modern warfare I was playing my first ranked game with my team. I threw a grenade at the beginning of the match by accident and wiped out everyone on my team except myself. Felt so stupid.  The unnecessary comma in the title bothers me more than it should. Why did you put that comma there? One guy lived At first I thought the guy who jumped out right as it closed was the one that fucked up. Then the guy throws his grenade and turns to everyone like "that made it out, right?" "No?"  That guy that dove out... We just witness final destination in a game  Spoony: "YOU FOOL!" You can be pretty sure this has actually happened in some war, and the last thing they all did was stare at the guy who messed up the grenade.  Hello darkness, my old friend.. What gets me is that he doesn't even try to throw until after the door's already closed. 

"Well... at least it's not in my hand!" Cue Seinfeld outro You arrogant ass. You've killed *us*! ''YOU HAD ONE FUCKING JOB JOHNSON." LOOOOOOOL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Xaj0ZOYoo We need an edit where they all look at him and it just freeze frames on his face with "How could this happen to me" playing in the background

Edit; https://gifsound.com/?gifv=P8MhFTn&v=y983TDjoglQ&s=36

close enough Whatever the opposite of the Medal of Honor is...he received it. Did anyone else hear the "!" when the zoom in on the grenade?  He is the most effective weapon the enemy has got.  What game is that? Looks like he's on his way to that fetish ball Damn I wish this had audio, best vid ever! lol *Queue Slow-Mo*

"Hello Darkness, my old friend" Zooms in. "Hello darkness my old friend..." You can practically hear the "Ooohh what'cha saaaayyy..." As soon as it zooms in on the grenade..

"Hello darkness, my old friend" With that title, it was like the team just got Ethan SSSSSSLLLLLAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMBERRIED!!!!
It's just a prank bro.  It kinda would be even better without team damage.. Everyone just looking Steve while he is facing certain death.. Even more awkward than the trip I took with a whole squad of hostile a to the bow room! Mmm whatchu say..? I know that you only mean well... All I could think of was [this](https://youtu.be/kTNR8OVKQhs) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGp9P6QvMjY LMAO that eye contact... im still rolling!!!  It was LAG I swear! I legit hear a voice when it zoomed on the grenade saying "and at that moment, I knew, *i fucked up*,"* [NOT MY FAULT.... SOMEONE PUT A WALL IN MY WAY](https://youtu.be/kTNR8OVKQhs) Hello darkness my old friend....  ♫ This made me genuinely laugh. Thank you Reddit! "Johnson, you motherfu..." 💥🔥 "Guys let me in"

*opens elevator*

"Oh" It was probably an accident too.

I've lost count of how many fuckups I've made that ended up saving me from something. "You just fucking killed us." If it was a real life situation, I don't know how I would react but I imagine it might be pretty similar. "That was the worst throw ever. Of all time." people coming together in videogames is one of my favourite things.

rocket arena madness, halo and tf2 shenanigans, even wow dance parties.

i really love how a bunch of people just... get it. can act silly.
 "You dirty dicked son of a bitch" Woulda been funnier if the player that threw it went prone over the grenade This is why mom doesn't fucking love you! It would be really cool if in a game you could jump on the grenade to reduce the range of damage.... For at least some redemption. Isn't it the guys fault who opened and then closed the door? "NOW YOU FUCKED UP"

"YOU HAVE FUCKED UP NOW"

"YOU FUCKED UP"
 I just hope that guy was on the mic with the rest of his squad, so he could hear what he ducked out on. Love the fact that he was crawling too. If I'm ever trying to get out of an elevator before some crazy lunatic lobs a frag in it, I'm just going to belly crawl the fuck out.... I think that was part of their plan. To have him crawl out right as the elevator closes. The grenade kills him. > Hello darkness, my old friend. #Mmmm, watcha saaayyy?  F when cs first came out this is all that happened.

there was this map, mansion. it's all anybody played.

there are windows you gotta get grenades in, or out of.

missing those was just so embarrassing. > Missing a grenade throw is one of the worst feelings in the world.

In real life, this is literally true. The worst game to miss grenades in by far was the original America's Army.  The mechanic for priming grenades was near perfect so it was liberally used (because dropping the spoon and waiting a second before throwing let you either air burst the grenade or give them no time to dive for cover when they heard the grenade drop next to them).  However, when you had a fireteam stacked on a corner by a door/wall/window etc and you heard somebody cook a grenade, followed by a dull thump and a "fuck" over TS, it was like turning a light on in a roomful of roaches watching everyone try to get clear, but it was always in vain.  Being "that guy" always sucked.

To add insult to injury I was also "that guy" in real life.  I was actually ordered to not carry anything but smokes overseas because my throwing during deployment workups was always so disastrous.  If you think fucking up a grenade throw in a game sucks, imagine the shit you get for dropping a blue body (or having it bounce back) almost every time you throw one. Oh definitely. Absolutely rage-inducing  What happened? Every single goddamn time I use a grenade.  https://youtu.be/4EgSkm9GLaU I've watched that maybe 10 times and I still can't for the life of me figure out how the hell he managed that. That was the worst throw ever. Of All time. Buster at Army That's a really smart grenade throwing range. The trench caught the grenade and there's two holes to dive into just incase say the grenade went into one of them. I didn't realize Tim Tebow tried to enlist. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFyNjwmyUyY Unable to play from laughing too hard, game eventually kicks you for idle. I mean if it was a one time thing then yea sure. But usually in hardcore I get team killed about 5 times a match due to the rise of low levels flocking in because of the free dlc. So getting grenaded by your team gets pretty common and quite annoying after a while.

Halfway up I started taking damage, and I realized the other guy wasn't on my team... "I can't believe you've done this." You arrogant ass! You've killed us!!  I would blame the guy who opened and then shut the door before I could throw the nade out "At least I have chicken" If I were the one stupid enough to throw that nade I would jump on it in hopes of saving the others. Of course this is Battlefied so no chance of that happening. Or just instinctively and hopelessly push the "door open" button. Then die. That's *exactly* how we reacted when a grenade landed right in the middle of a group of us. Thankfully it was a training grenade, so tinnitus and rage ensued, rather than maiming and death.

To be honest, of the times I've been blown up, that was the funniest.

We have a horde coming, and run into a closet. I toss my molotov at the doorway to burn the zombies as they come... but my friend closes the door right as I throw. In slow motion the molotov bounces off the door and lights the entire closet on fire and we burn to death. caboose, sigh I've always found that to be the greatest beauty of multi-player games. It's just so fun and hilarious.  I love that feeling. Its the same sort of feeling you get when a bunch of drivers subconsciously come together to deny an asshole driver. Rocket Arena, hahah. My favorite is playing alliance in a bg, arena or in any pvp environment  and the horde (opposing side) dances or plays with you. I found a lot of times that classes have a greater bond than races. Many opposing rogues would /salute me or dance without attacking.  One of the few cases where autocorrect would be right when suggesting ducked instead of fucked  What song is that from
Edit:holy shit this exploded faster than my cum Why is this meme so popular? I get that it's a song, a good one at that, but how does it fit into context? Mansion was great. But waiting at the vent on Assault for some poor bastard to drop down from the roof was perfection when I was 13. Now they have Mirage and the "appartments" section where you have to throw grenades through a barred-off window AND an arch/doorway in the room past the window to have a good chance of hitting somebody.  Dude you're looking at isn't playing, enemy runs around corner, throws frag, gets ready to shoot the guy, explodes from his own grenade. The guy with the grenade panicked and chucked the grenade when he saw an enemy- it bounced off of the wall, killing himself. The person he threw it at didn't even move and likely wasn't at their keyboard (afk/away from keyboard). Guy came running in, tossed a nade, it bounced as he ran back, blew himself up. /r/me_irl_gaming I think he had a lose grip on it and it slid out of his hand. I can't get over the dude who eats that sand bag when they jump into the hole. I think he rolled a 1. Noob right clicked instead of left clicking. It's a girl Not his fault.  Somebody put a wall in his way. 50 Cent's first pitch is tough to beat. In grenade training....they make you throw it in the dumbest way possible too...so that didn't help. I agree with Kanye here.   You say that, but have you considered why there are two separate pits behind them? https://youtu.be/AqNri9u4uqU At least it's a half day! I'm not a monster!! That's how most Grenade ranges are laid out. Some are concrete though. Very important to jump into the ~~right~~ correct hole, though.
 Pretty common set up though some have a more booth like set up in case it doesn't go into a trench, so sharpenel who travel to dar.

 Holy shit that was great. "Hes named himself Auschwitz." What game is this? Holy shit I didn't think arma was like that it looks awesome.

Honestly I doubt it. I mean no offense to you, but I do not think the *average Redditor* is brave enough to cover a grenade with his body even with the pin still inside. 
 The funny thing is, jumping on the grenade [actually works in BF4](https://youtu.be/az-RJFl9sRA?t=14s) "Come on come on come on come on!" Yeah that's basically me with sticky grenades in Planetside 2. I have a great hit ratio with those since they're my favorite weapon, and the kills are near exactly half of the hits...because the other half is friendly fire. 

Nothing sucks like lining up a perfect shot and having a friendly run in front of you, sticking the grenade to them instead, and sitting there watching them run off into battle with their team only to explode and your screen and chat window get flooded with hate tells and warnings about your weapons being locked for team killing. 

I mean...it's hilarious, but annoying at the same time.  I loved closing doors in my friends face. Ahh the memories. I live for moments like these in L4D2... when there's no voice communication, but someone looks at you, sees exactly what you're up to and joins in. I play a game called Brawlhalla. Its basically a free version of Smash and I was doing a free for all, which is 4 players against each other. One of the players started pressing left and right rapidly, which makes your character do a sort of dance. Suddenly everyone ran up to him and started dancing too. It was awesome how 4 strangers with no sort of text or voice communication can forget the seriousness of the game and act silly.  I read it as fucked first assuming that's what he ment.

I think it originally came from an episode of *The Simpsons*. Watch Arrested Development. It is used as a cue when we know and the character knows that they made a huge mistake.  People say Arrested Development. But really the Arrested Development bit is a call back to the Graduate, where Dustin Hoffman has an existential crisis.

 pretty sure its a reference to multiple occasions of the last season of arrested development we were in our late teens when we played 6.42beta.

i owned that vent. Do those bars actually effect the grenades? I always bank it off the wall so I've literally never hit them lol palms are sweaty.  Why is it that these grenade throw fail videos make it seem so difficult to toss one? Did  not see that until I read your comment. Now everyone in subway thinks I'm fucked in the head because I laughed out loud He did his job at least, being there to toss the shithead in there if he fucks up.  Did it so well he wasn't even paying attention to where he leaped himself. +1 for the RvB reference follow-up. :) Seriously though, the only thing I can assume from the throw is that there was some covering that slipped off when he tried to throw it. It did some goofy back flip toss when it came out of his hand. My guess it was that fucking Mei troll Lone_Dire.  >so sharpenel who travel to dar. 

That's just as I suspected. Oh yea I agree. It's just it grows old after a while.

Well, keep in mind jumping in a random pub CAN be a mindless deathmatch, but grouping up with people, getting into servers with good admins, and other such results in videos like above. I know the feeling. To be fair, the group shown in the video is a gaming clan or guild, so they have some level of familiarity with each other. Don't make me tell you again, about the scooching I, Agree,. I thought it was a fart joke "I swear to god if we survive this im shoving a live grenade up your ass" Which doesn't mean much at this point  Am I the only one who immediately heard the **!** from Metal Gear, when it zoomed in on the grenade?

Is a tripwire the same kind of explosive as a grenade? Solihull !! :) throw someone else's body on it, preferably the one who dropped the grenade! Well but unless one of your comrade are willing to do it for you, you'll die anyway. So might as well save some lives... It's not even the "average redditor" is the "average human." Even trained soldiers rarely do it, which is why it's such a big deal.

In reality we'd all probably freeze in panic/shock before bravery/cowardice even came into play. I mean yeh a nade someone else threw no, but the one I threw that would kill my squad then yes. *average person

No love for militia? That goddamn vent.

I still remember being on the roof, covering exits, to hear the FATHWUMP sound someone makes when they drop into the vent and start derping their way through. I loved taking pop-shot headshots at them while they made their way up the ladder to the outside roof.

Fuck I miss that game. Now that I think about it, I don't know. I always thought they did, but maybe that's just my memory because I don't specifically remember a nade bouncing off of the bars. It makes it harder to aim though I guess.  Throw's weak

'nade is armed and ready Not today Mr. Mathers. Because why would anyone post a grenade throw success video?

Seriously, though; I can't speak for everyone else, but I'll admit I struggled a little with the grenade qualification when I went through army basic training. The grenades were spherical (not the "pineapple" shape that you might see in movies), and a little bit smaller than a baseball. You've got a drill sergeant there watching over you to make sure you're safe, but in my head, I'm thinking, "don't fuck up." The lever on the grenade makes it sit funny in your hand, and when you go to release it you kind of have to open your hand all at once - almost shot-putting it up and forward, rather than letting it roll off your fingers like you're pitching a baseball. And when you do let go, if you didn't time it right, then when the lever springs off of the grenade body, it can fly a little bit funky. 

Then again, that was when I was 19, and the last time I had thrown a baseball was 10 years earlier in my county little league. And I never threw another grenade after basic training to see if I could improve. Grenade instructor here.

You'll freak out. 

You'll spend all day, training with popper dummies, getting every step drilled into your head, and then you'll step onto the throw line, be handed a live grenade, and you'll forget every fucking thing and freak the fuck out, before you've even made it live.

God help you if you freeze with the grenade prepped because you just realized you have an explosive next to your ear. Probably just nervousness, I know I'd be pretty nervous if I was holding a live explosive.  Dammit Grif!!  [deleted] I enjoyed it from the start. The new patch was huge. New weapons/Kits/ and now there's vehicles.

A) Bugs need to be ironed out. People are crashing (the game) a lot due to some physics in the unreal engine. 

B) The player base needs to learn how to use the vehicles. It's a little bit complicated. It'll probably take a few weeks. 

C) Joining servers needs to be easier. 

After that, I'd say far better than before. Engagements start far earlier instead of having to trek it for 5-10 minutes on the big maps.

It terms of "hardcore" it's below red orchestra, and above insurgency. Those are the references I can give.

...and there was life before the internet.  Book was better though. "Eh, he got lucky, don't let it get to his dumbass head." Probably wasn't happy his son threw himself on a grenade. I mean, in one way proud, but I imagine as a parent, fuck that. He probably cares more about his son than he does about the guys he was trying to sacrifice himself for. I'd be pretty annoyed with my son if he did that too. [Tripping in the shower kills upwards of 16k a year in the US](https://www.answers.com/Q/How_many_people_die_every_year_from_falling_down_in_their_shower_tub?#slide=3) I popped my should out about a week and a half ago from falling and putting my arm down, I didn't even hit the ground. I landed weirdly on my palm and the shoulder went 'pop'. Wasn't half as bad as the first time but yeah you can fuck yourself from the smallest things. We had a guy in my battalion in the Marine Corp that was sprayed down and only got shot in the ass. His plate caught 3 rounds and one went in and out of one of his ass cheeks as he fell. He got sent back 3 months later. The first thing he did when he got off the helo was yell at our LT this was bullshit. Our LT just nods. He never got sent outside the wire again. No, they are assigned names by the Ministry of Cock Jokes. It would certainly reduce the blast area a bit (as long as it's held down) but then the helmet itself would become shrapnel for anyone standing close.  I wouldn't stake my life on it. A tripwire is just a method to set off something, be it a flare, an IED, or to let the spoon pop off a grenade hidden to the side of a path/doorway/etc. The tripwire itself isn't explosive, it's just a wire either under tension or without tension that causes something to happen when tension is relieved or added. You're missing the point. You have three seconds or so to decide that you will commit suicide to improve the chances of survival for your allies. 

You won't be thinking rationally at all, you'll be panicked as hell. If you're still able to throw yourself onto it, you're insanely brave.

We will all be better for it. Aaah man. Thanks. I needed that. :'D The mariachi one kills me Me too. But it is used for a slightly different purpose, right? More like when we and the characters know a major bummer just occurred. militia was so fun, holy memories. The new one is a decent map but I don't see why they changed it so radically from the old one. Ugh that vent. The first minute or so it was lobbing grenades into the vent from both sides...  Grenade is on his sweater already  Are there dummy grenades to use for practice that would have the same feel as a live one? 

I would think they could come up with something the same shape/weight and the same sort of mechanism, but just blink an LED or something to let you know it "exploded" properly after the conditions are met. Then you could lob it around all day long to get a good feel for how to throw it properly without the risk of throwing a live explosive. Interesting. I had imagined it to be similar to a baseball but the force of the lever releasing obviously changes it a bit. Thanks for the insight! And another thing on my list of reasons on why not to join the military. >God help you if you freeze with the grenade prepped because you just realized you have an explosive next to your ear.

http://i.imgur.com/URbZiiu.jpg
 don't grenades have a mechanism where they'll only explode if you throw it anyway? [Not even Grif, Sarge would still blame him though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTNR8OVKQhs) Pretty on point actually. In training they have us throw several dummy grenades from different positions and in different scenarios before we actually throw our first live one. They are a lot heavier than baseballs so it's more of a lob. The fatal errors are also an issue :/

My experience with the vehicles: 

00. *A7 is finally out! Hopefully some performance improvements!* 
1. Spawn. Notice that squad is _very_ far away. 
0. *Notice that FPS has gone down from a barely acceptable but playable 24 FPS to a horrid 11.*
2. See vehicle. _Sweet_ Try get in it. "ask Squad Lead for approval". Eh. Okay. *Squad Lead dies.*
3. Yaay entire squad is back at spawn. Wait for vehicle cooldown. Wait longer. "40s left guys"
4. Can't wait no more. Go pee real quick! RUN -- RUN BACK.
5. Squad has just left with the vehicle and are 10m away -- "Waait you left me!"
6. "Sorry bro, the car is full."
7. Fine. Run all the way. _ALL THE WAY_.
8. ...
9. ...
10. ...
10. 7 minutes in it's the longest run I've ever done in squad.
10. ...
11. Consider leaving the game. Decide to continue.
12. ...
13. Finally get to see battlefield. 
14. ...
15. ...
16. Get in battle. 
17. Crawl around for days.
18. Teamies dying everywhere. 
19. Manage to survive long enough to flank slightly past enemy. 
20. Get 2 kills. 
21. ***"Your team has lost by 422 tickets."*** Eh. The last bit was kinda fun.
22. Regret playing. Head hurts from low fps lag. Is it any better optimized? I have a decent PC and it just ran like ass last time a tried it (a couple months ago now). I had to refund it.

I was also suffering from terrible input delay from my mouse, could not seem to find a fix. That was both horrible but fucking hilarious at the same time.  Sure thing :-) Also worth checking out is the Project Reality mod for Arma... Haha yeah true. , totally. I’m gonna assume you know the

[deleted] Yeah, from the perspective of everyone else involved, and some sort of hypothetical "societal" perspective, it's great and heroic. From the perspective of your family, it borders on selfishness. (Though I guess not in this situation, since not jumping on it wouldn't have done him any better. It's certainly ridiculously brave, but is it heroic to jump on a grenade which will almost certainly kill you regardless of if you jump on it? Just seems sensible at that point.) Your life isn't just your own to throw away. >upwards of 16k a year

>the number seemed sky high in 1998. 

>15,900

>upwards of 16k Omg, more people are killed by showers than by guns..... (Homicides) 

Ban showers! I mean most of those people are gonna be elderly and dying from associated complications though.  I almost died slipping in the shower twice this year, then a couple weeks ago I slipped again, but caught myself.

I'm thinking about just switching to baths because it's freaking me out now. I dislocated my tailbone by sitting down in a fork lift. I really don't understand how. Which I assume is conposed by the members of Monty Python. I just looked it up, I thought those helmets was a bit more stronger, I guess not. They do just turn into shrapnel. Supposedly best thing to do is get the hell down face first and hope the help deflects a blunt of the force.

https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-thing-to-do-when-a-grenade-is-thrown-at-you I think moments like those are instinctual. You don't know what you would do unless you are put in the moment. I've been in a similar situation with lower stakes (loosing my arm) and didn't even have time to think before I knew it I had saved this person and risked loosing my arm to do it. Up until then I never thought I would ever put myself in danger to save anyone never mind someone I didn't even know. AMAZING CHEST AHEAD Haha, nothing against you personally, it's just that the meme died long ago and I saw it a little too much in the last days. True, they aren't quite the same. Mom's spaghetti 🍝 There are blue ones that just pop and smoke. Honestly throwing a grenade isn't difficult unless you're under the stress of basic training. That turns everyone into an idiot. In Marine Corps recruit training grenade safety starts on day one. In the cafeteria (we call it the messhall) you have to treat drinks exactly like grenades. Once you get close to the day you throw a live grenade you start with dummy ones. Eventually you throw a live one. People are paired with drill instructors from other platoons (to reduce the chance of an angry recruit wanting to go full metal jacket on their drill instructor) and it is the only time any of them were nice to me. Before I threw it he asked me how my day was, where I was from in the nicest tone. After I threw it he yelled at me for being a sorry shit stain of a recruit and to get the fuck out of his grenade pit. [They're about the size of a tennis ball and completely hollowed out](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Reservehigh20048611453.jpg/300px-Reservehigh20048611453.jpg) so that they can be reused by simply inserting a fresh fuse and cap. Definitely a bit goofy to throw compared to a standard pineapple, which is larger and easier to grip around the spoon with your fingers. That "force" is basically negligable though. It's not like a super high tension mechanism. The military is a great opportunity for many people, I know it was exactly what 17 year old me needed. But it is not, and should not, be for everyone. Correct, the final safety on a grenade is a spoon, that is spring loaded to the firing hammer and only goes off when you release it from your hand. I see through your ruse. 

SUCK IT, RED!!!! A lot of people had some issues with the game. There are a few fixes online where you have to edit a few lines in the config files, but it only improves FPS by maybe 10 at most for me. If you don't have at least 30 FPS before trying to fix it I wouldn't even bother with the game because you need to see far distances.  Seems to be the awesome theme in rust.  THEY LOOK EXACTLY NOTHING ALIKE >Please tell me that was a smoke grenade

For a most rare and beautiful Pepe that moment when your 63 year old coworker just thinks you're a knobhead. it's actually quite frequent.  Unsuspecting guy gets hit and doesn't like it. For me, it's not just about him getting hit unexpectedly, it's his reaction to it that's hilarious. He doesn't scream or fight back, he just says "I can't believe you've done this," in the most rational, indignant tone--much like how you would chastise a child--for sucker punching him in the face! It's hilarious! [*expression of utter disdain*](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/thumbs/1D51B9ECC41141030318007324672_3.0.1.15026640691840596890.mp4.jpg) Ruskies dont take a dump without a plan son.

Now I'm just picturing Red Foreman as a giant black guy. Well, he was the one to activate the tripwire. Yeah, it was a mistake and you couldn't blame him for running away, but I think he felt like it was his responsibility to protect his fellow soldiers, even if that meant dying.

And yeah. I'd say it's heroic. He could've run as far as he could and thrown himself on the ground to increase his chances of avoiding shrapnel. [deleted] It's correct for sufficiently low values of 16. We all know what was happening in 1998. It wasn't until we got regulations on showers that people stopped dying from it.

Haha it wasn't until you posted this that I realized the drill sergeants that day were from a different company.  #THE ONLY GOOD BLUE IS A DEAD BLUE I've seen prettier pepes >and doesn't like it.

How strange. Doesn't sound exciting when you say it.  So how's he gonna get the crew off the sub? Hey, Ryan, be careful what you shoot at. Most things in here don't react too well to bullets. Which actually makes it even more heartbreaking. A mysterious awesome place he'd read about in books.  ...I miss Tom Clancy. -_- >He could've run as far as he could and thrown himself on the ground to increase his chances of avoiding shrapnel.

It says that he only had time to yell "GRENADE" before it went off. That's not much time to run. I don't want to take anything away from the quality of his character, because I don't think the instinct is to jump on a grenade unless you accept that you're going to die, *but* I think that in the situation, doing anything other than jumping on it as he did would have been a worse idea even if he were alone.

That said, I'm just some jackass on the internet, what do I know about grenades? Only if you are loved by no one.

If you've ever lost a loved one (A real loved one. One you love in a real, definitive way, not some broad conceptual idea. A grandparent you saw once a year doesn't count.), you know what an absolutely absurd amount of damage that does to your life.  You have a responsibility not to do that to people as best you can. The nazis say hello [Challenge accepted.](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=adolf&view=detailv2&&id=A53A2CE3EC1398CE8C7FE9D98DE34E39A8C511F4&selectedIndex=0&ccid=djbdm%2f3A&simid=607993518544391745&thid=OIP.M7636dd9bfdc0603c5aa977d130b40d7eo1&ajaxhist=0) I believe in you [deleted] He opens his hand, but the 'nade just slipped out

He's freaking out, everybody's running, now

To cover, wow, TIMES UP OVER BLAOW!

 He tries to pull the pin but it won't come out,

His comrades shout out; 

Time's up, over

BLAOW! Close to zero risk, since they're paired with drill instructors they don't know. Mental cases are washed out pretty quickly, within first two weeks of training.  Some people are kinky like that, so you never know, could have gone both ways. I have to be careful what I shoot at?! Fair enough, but I don't think he knew that the bag would've blocked the shrapnel. Even simply throwing yourself on the ground and facing away from the grenade would be a more sensible action than throwing yourself on the grenade if you assume that jumping on it would to kill you. Well, I'm not going to say this is down to 'millennial selfishness' or anything, but it does seem more than a little... unfair?

But then we're talking about two different situations here, I suppose. The former being as per the original story when someone lays down their life to save others.

I guess you *could* say there's some selfishness in not considering their loved ones before saving lives, but the lives being saved doubtless have all kinds of loved ones, too. By considering them I'd think the person in  question was being selfless, not selfish.

There are things we aspire to as human beings: Our idealised better nature. And prime amongst those is the concept that someone who lays down his life for his brother is the best of us.

'Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.'

Denying someone the opportunity to become perhaps the best a human can hope to be in this world because it would hurt *you*, because of *your* loss and pain... now that - I'm sorry - does seem a little selfish.

However, it's nothing compared to situation number two: Suggesting that someone in intolerable, screaming pain - be it physical or mental - should continue to suffer every minute of every hour of every day because their loss would hurt *you*. Now, that *is* a special kind of selfishness and closed-mindedness.

How much time are you willing to put in in the effort to ease this person's pain? 4 hours a day? 8 hours? Every hour of every day? Because if not willing to sacrifice anything less than your *entire life* in the effort to ease this pain - a pain you cannot possibly understand or truly sympathize with - then you've got some chutzpah saying they should suffer a 24/7 life of misery for *your* sake. This deserves at least positive karma. Considering loved ones is one of the places my suicidal friends draw strength from. He did nazidat coming.  Clam down, Hitler. Fuse runs out times up over now! Blind to the eyes

Came up in your face


Oops POW surprise! 


[OOOOOOOOOOHHHH!](http://youtu.be/gfBe304IgQI) Good.  I fucking love how he just stood there and finally decided to reload.  Close brush? More like 'tongue-kissing Death and fondling his no-nos'. I like how he cocks his head slightly towards the gun like he squeezed the trigger a couple of times and finally realized that it was empty  That was a quick repost I love fallout 4 and I miss playing it so much but every time I get on I'll be so immersed in the game and it will freeze.  wow its almost like i saw this in video form from the original creator yesterday weird \*clickclickclick*

Oh yeah, 6 bullets, shit. What was that breeze?  Only slightly related, but what helmet is that? Sadly I now have to have one.  Has a mod come out that allows you to turn off the cinematic aspect of V.A.T.S? Plugging the raider in the head with his revolver, the Sole Survivor screamed in fright and threw his gun to the ground once he realized the stiff breeze racing past him was the shell of a mini nuke. "Holy shit, I almost died!" He cried out, watching a distant explosion.

A few hundred feet away, the Vault Tec sales representative saw a glint on the ground. "Oh, boy! A shiny new bottle cap!" He gasped with surprise and joy, taking the cap into his hand. "It looks like everything's turning around for me today!" He slowly stood, flipping the cap in his fingers. Turning on his heel, he's immediately attacked by a wild mongrel, which clamps it's jaws down on his inner thigh. Yowling in pain, he flailed. The world went supernova as the mini nuke landed.

Miraculously surviving the explosion but thrown far from the blast, the Vault-Tec representative struggled to catch his breath, his wheezing alerting a nearby squad of Super Mutants.
 "He's reloading. All need to do is roll higher than a 1."

"Fuuuuuuuuuu..." Clipped through your shoulder. Should have died. The best part was squinting to see the gif. NOT EVEN CLOSE BAYBBEEE I was just there a couple hours ago! The guy probably feels like Frieza when he missed Goku at close range when he went Super Saiyan.  Was that a shoulder fired nuke???? Passing a class by 1 percent. That was more tense than a mooses butt during fly season Repost of another user, typical karma stealing.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/5f8w4q/i_screamed_the_whole_time/ ahhahaha wow  *pop* *click* *click* "Oh! Gotta reload! Hang on a sec." *pop* *pop* If it was call of duty it would have hit I, too, try to avoid a Fat Man to the face. Ill give you credit, you waited almost a day.  There is zero self-preservation A.I. with Fallout NPCs One day we'll be telling our grandkids stories about our virtual battles in virtual wars. Just as our grandparents tell us of stories of... Actual.. Battles in, actual... Wars... Yup. My butt puckered. Close Shave with death... That mini-nuke had its way with you then left Aries this shit sweet asab *whistling intensifies* Haha I played this part earlier today  Freak'in awesome clip. 

I have my criticisms of Bethesda's direction, but I can't help but love it.  Yep lol  Where did he get that mask? Damn, I'm always bitching about people bitching about reposts, but wasn't this front page a few days ago? I need to get off Reddit for awhile it seems. I swear to god this was posted less then a day ago. [Hey this kinda happened to me too!](http://imgur.com/gallery/MQaDD6p) At least the game doesn't crash when biggie smalls come out in vats unlike fallout 3. Misred the title as "Close brush with teeth". Thought the mini-nuke would graze his teeth or something..? That was a quick repost you stole this bro i can clearly see the "oh god when was the last time i saved?" moment am I the only one who started actually aiming in Fallout 4 instead of using V.A.T.S? I feel like I've been more accurate (In most situations) You can't die while in Vats (I think) You just stay at 1 or even 0 hp This video was posted like yesterday, and now someone made it into a gif and gets 5k+ karma, without any credit to author. This site sucks. He just stood there and looked at his gun as if it was going to reload all by itself  I wish that asshole would miss *me* more often. Can't count the number of times I forgot about that jerk on top of Gunner Plaza only too hear the tell-tale whistle of the football of doom when I got too close. Nice repost OP. This subreddit makes good gifs but has the worst comments. 95% of the time the comments are just "This is a repost". Are you playing on easy? Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooke Hey this isnt your content hit with that jank.. Leave the vault they said, it'll be a lot of fun they said. i know exactly what mission this is and I cant finish it because the scribe is missing. i guess i will never be part of the brother hood I like how he falls forward after being shot with a .44 Magnum in the face. What game is this please?  Oh.Holy.Shit. This happened to me three times today, and I don't even play this game. /r/gifsthatendtoosoon Sick hitbox parry that shit  Love Fallout, but posted because I love your name more.  Is nice Yea java does suck \#justVATSthings Cool guys don't look at explosions you fool  Holy shit where do you get that helmet? Been looking for a cool looking helmet to replace my commando helmet. "How'd that guy manage to kill you?"

I shot a nuke at him and missed 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ [Nope. Nope. Nope.](http://i.imgur.com/KvfSpjO.gifv) Luck S.P.E.C.I.A.L must be super high [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/5f8w4q/i_screamed_the_whole_time/) Jokes on you, the radiation is going to get you.  This was also on the front page yesterday... God this was just posted a day or two ago under a different name. Jeeeeesshhhhhiiiiit... http://i.imgur.com/UdNywXG.gifv The small head-turn the character does before reloading is perfect. Lady Luck Is Smiling. 
 REALLY?!!?? epic repost Fucking gunners I hate those guys

Handgun? I'm all about combat rifles in fo4 :) Fallout 4, or "Why I no longer conceal carry revolvers." Dude is firing a mini nuke and goes for the head shot lol Nuce Nuce You can't die, it's just a game, bro Ohhhhhhhh that's close  [Original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXvciKOS8hQ) When I post my shit like this I get two votes.. other people do it and they get fucking thousands.. fucking r/gaming The Imgur title is way better. Because of that gif's size.  This killed me, and almost him. I'm not even sure it's been 24 hours since I saw the original version of this on front page I love when this happens. VATS is amazing.  If my almost 200 hours of FO4 has taught me anything, you wouldn't have taken a lick of damage anyway in VATS Scuuuuuuse me This is all kinds of perfect. This was posted yesterday.. I never understood re-posting in such a short period of time.  Enjoy your fake internet points i guess. What kind of armor is that Barely a day before repost That rocket passed by at the same speed as a super Mario smiley canon bullet... IT'S ONLY BEEN 2 DAYS! HOW DID THIS REPOST GIF GET SO SMALL?!? this video has already been posted, good way to get post karma I guess... This was so good.  I like how he just stands there for a second and looks at his gun like 
 *BAM BAM click click click* "...you gotta be fucking me right now" Annnnd code brown  You're a close brush with death. Seriously have no idea why people like this game. Such crap. the best part is the raider didn't even think twice about ending his own life by firing off a close nuke, he knew he was dead anyway so why not try to take out the survivor while he's at it I thought it said "Brush your Teeth" I was so confused Someone should invent a brush is the shape of the Grim Reaper. Then, every morning you could say you had a 'brush with death.' Fallout 4 was one of the first games I got after getting back into gaming after around 5 years. I heard so much about the series and I wanted to try it out. I loved it at first, seemed like it's as good as it gets, but after playing dark souls, witcher 3 and some other games... I realized this game sucks ass... the game is so laggy i couldn't even finish that robot expansion. It's also very repetitive, fighting mechanics sucks and feels kinda clumsy ... to bad because this was the first fallout I tried and after that experience I don't think I will ever play fallout series again. Literally cringed  Im pretty sure that he was just too shocked to reload for a few seconds. I mean he did just shoot a guy in the head with a 44 mag and then that dude turned and fired a small nuclear weapon at him. I would be a bit shocked too. Can someone explain why that happened so often to me in-game?

This Gif's sped up so its hard to tell, but you can be just fucking standing there for like 3 whole seconds sometimes. If time fully stopped it wouldn't be so bad but Deathclaws and what-not can move pretty fucking fast in VATS mode still, and this little "bug" has literally been the sole reason for my death *multiple* times. A metaphore for the whole game  I mean you'd think your enemy would be a little slower after  taking .357 to the back of the head. 


Edit: no helmet too.  "Wait a second there, dude. I gotta reload."

...

...

...

*tchick-tchick*

"All good!" [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXvciKOS8hQ) Looks at his gun for a moment. "Hmm..." Oh shit only one bullet left  "Alright, time for the second shot... wait, what? It's empty? Aw, shit, guess I should reload." I was gonna say "maybe he had one shot left and was lining it up", but then I realized that would be just as retarded if hes going to reload without taking the shot anyway -.- The camera zoom really gets me. Its like an episode of The Office. Also notice how he kinda looks at it like oh shit I'm out of ammo  That was the gun clicking and him noticing he's out of bullets. Looks realistic to me. Death with benefits  Deadpool? Death has 'no-nos' under under that robe?  Nah, that's how death cuts you some slack.  This would be like bull fighting death. Those damn chems man... *click click* "Wut? Oh it's empty, gotta reload, hold on lol" Yep. Find any video on the front page, make a GIF of it, reap karma. With an even smaller gif. Tomorrow's will be ant sized. I haven't seen the original... Quicker than that reload. Op has lots of Karma from posts.  Sounds like your graphics card is overheating. There are some mods that compress some of the graphical files, the quality drop is almost entirely unnoticeable to my eyes, and it helps with frame rate. Maybe freezing too? If you are interested I can point you to some stuff. [deleted] I enjoyed playing the game too, despite my best framerate being ~25fps on 800x600. That was until they released an update that made the game unplayably glitched on integrated intel cards. That sucked. Same, I use no mods and countless reinstalls but I get an endless loading loop and have to quit. I know right.... its like ... almost the exact same thing that i watched yesterday but something is missing and cant figure out what. To be fair, I would have never watched the video.

I never watch videos posted to reddit. Can I get a link to the original please? I missed it. But now I'm lucky to have seen this post. Bummer that it bothers you though.

 Just imagine how many submissions that you enjoy a day that are reposts but you don't know because it's your first time seeing them...

What would reddit be if no reposts were allowed only OC. *Once*

*Whoa.* Dirty Harry?  Synth field helmet  It's one of the variations of synth helmets I believe.  I'm pretty sure there is an option to take it out in the settings.  You can just hit the VATS button again during it to stop it, I normally just watch to see if my shot hit then stop it right away.  Yes.  I use [VATS Tweaks](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/1064/?).  It lets you disable all of the killcams, and also stop time entirely during VATS aiming like it was in Fallout 3. You know, it's a good thing the vault tec salesman never changed his outfit in 200 years, or else i never would have recognized him. Go on... Where is that? A "Fat-Man" tactical nuke launcher. So, yes, but a much smaller version of your normal "obliterate the entire city" warhead. Probably not because that'd be retarded That's a Synth Field Helmet. Sold in the institute, can be found on some Synth corpses. It's more so in this case because it's a worse version than the one that was posted just yesterday. If you're going to repost, don't make the content worse. The OP of the posted video yesterday (now converted to gif) and stated he had maxed out one of his luck perks that makes npcs miss.  Fallout 4 Synth Field Helmet, sold in Institute, can be on Synth bodies. Lets kill the big bad guy.. oh wait, lets reload first xD it's an intimidation strategy, don't let them know you're out of ammo, maybe he'll try to run. [removed] "Darling you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?"  It's been like that since 3.  It always seemed to me that it was just bad timing on the slomo effect after shots.  If you were to see it real time there wouldn't actually be that awkward of a pause.  

I may be wrong here but basically your character pulls the trigger once on every empty clip and since there is no gun shot and, because of the model, you can't actually see your finger pulling the trigger - it appears that your character just sits there doing nothing. Dates back to the turn based system of 1 and 2. The VATS system is essentially integrating a TBC system into a FPS. The wait time is when it isn't your turn so to speak. You can only shoot, reload, etc during your turn. VATS isn't supposed to be realistic. Step one: Don't use VATS.  You can back out of VATS early though.  Seems like the game 1st checks bullet, 2nd Fires bullet, 3rd fire rate pause, then goes back to step one. It should instead check bullet before waiting for the fire rate cooldown, so that after your last bullet is fired you would immediately go into reload animation rather than waiting on the fire rare cooldown. What video game is this? Metaphor.

I also don't see how it applies. Drop the e. Its cleaner [deleted] heck, l did that deer-hunting before.  it's  easy unless they react.. Even better, the revolvers in this game are .44 while fallout 4 improved the gunplay a lot, as the enemies get harder they get a but bullet spongier.  Sometimes it can feel a bit like destiny to me in that sense - you've shot the dude 8 times in the head, but he's still not dead and all he's wearing is a baseball cap.

Thats why I recommend everyone make a stealth melee weapon critical build, and uppercut deathclaws into space (not for first play through!). God damn he ran all the way up there with only 2 bullets in his gun and could have reloaded at any time, dude deserved to die. Fucking band name if i ever heard one. I logged in just to upvote you, OP should rename /r/me_irl No. No no-nos More detailed :

1. Find any video that has a lot of upvote and comments.

2. Turn the video into a gif with a shitty gif converter.

3. Wait atleast 7-8 hours.

4. Post it.

5. Get Karma. Honestly idgaf id rather watch a gif > Yep. Find any video on the front page, make a GIF of it, **rape and pillage** karma.

 Meh, this karma is earned. It's a service to everyone that needs gif. It needs to be at least three times bigger! Yeah, that's usually what it is. This happened to me on my laptop and then I bought a USB cooling fan and now it stays well within a tolerable temp range.  nah, just gotta overclock your gigahertz  Yeah, totally. Could you give me the names or a link? Point me too, I just bought the game and I want to find some must have mods.  Take care and may all of your hits be critical. Sorry to hear you're not doing well dude, hope it gets better.  I feel sorry for your computer. Believe me I know how that feels. I beaten GTA IV (which is known in history as one of the worst PC optimization game) in lowest 800x600, 5-20 fps. I just proceeded on to the game. it's the audio the shot going over the shoulder is normal speed to make it seem like it doesn't clip through rather than slowed like in the original https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXvciKOS8hQ It's also been one day and is a gif not a video, so the original producer of this doesn't get any credit or recognition whatsoever. If this was like a few months later I understand but it's been one day.  I realize when most.of the stuff I haven't seen is a repost, cuz there's always a screaming mob in the comments  I think this every time I see people complaining about reposts.

>But...but *I* haven't seen it before... Well if the reposts were gone it would cut down on content by 50% or more for most of these subs so it would be a lot more likely you would have seen the original post. It would also consolidate all the comments so you dont have to look at 5 threads for one thing. 

Not to mention people would get credit for their own work which is nice and questions to OP about the post might actually get answered if OP is the creator and not some guy copying other peoples stuff with no knowledge about what actually happened/what work went into making it. I have yet to find any synth helmets.... I know it was there in NV but I can't find it in settings for 4. It's part of his skin now. The top of the GNN building.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Crockett_(nuclear_device)

Here's a real life Fat Man (launcher) not really shoulder mountable but pretty portable for a fucking nuclear warhead.  And there will be way cooler games by then Lololol Thanks Thank you!  xD Not bashing the video, but I'm somewhat confused as to why this was posted in response to the above comment... Is he using an iPad as a monitor?  It's like listening to a child describe their favorite game, it's so adorable. Is posting this a meme in itself? What kind of rig does grandpa run? Nah it got worse with 4 because they move faster  3 was worse for me.  I'd freeze permanently until I was shot to death. Sometimes for minutes if the enemy was far away.  *magazine. Yes, I'm that guy.

And in fact, this was a revolver in the picture, so... it doesn't even have a magazine. Fallout 4 Darude - Sandstorm Fallout 4 Pacman ... dude lmao Battletoads  Darude Sandstorm Fallout 4 Video game? Video game!? This is an interactive video master piece. An art work. A banana stapled to naked woman. A "video game"? Psh This isn't a video game.  This happened at my house last night. Oblivion with guns... A major criticism is that the Lone Survivor sets off on an urgent quest to find his kidnapped baby, then perhaps proceeds to plant corn for 60 hours. Not reloading immediately is not seeking Shaun immediately.


Hope this helped. It apples because the nuke is like one. Mtaphore? Deez nuts, probably nrop xobtih That's dirty ;) You mean a stealth sniper? Like how all of my characters in either the Elder Scrolls or 3D Fallout series eventually end up as stealth crit snipers/archers. I'm currently playing the game on Survival with just 1 point of Endurance, and stealth is the *only* way to survive.  I've avoided FO4, but I still play FO3 some, and the idea that I could shoot people in the head, repeatedly, at close range, with a rifle, annoyed me so much that I eventually just installed a mod that basically makes all head shots to be one shot kills, it's the only way I'll play now. /r/gif is basically /r/videos just several hours behind.

The chernobyl dome video is about due to be made into a gif and posted. In my experience the process is:

Go on Imgur

Go to Viral --> Newest

Find whatever is there and sort to a subreddit

Source: Am a karma whore as a hobby and also I saw this just 3 hours ago and thought about posting it but didn't. At least is two words.  You forgot number 6. 

Listen to people get upset about it. Step 4.5 buy insurance. 

Step 6 profit. Worth popping open and cleaning the fans/heatsinks too if you can.  Laptop fans tend to get pretty bad being in bags and stuff constantly.

Spary a bit of compressed air every few months and it'll prolong the life of the fans as well.  Dust build up kills computers. Going to have to try this  Ageing laptop. It's fine though, I raised it off the desk on a book so the fan's got better airflow. All's good. it's the soul WHAT? SPEAK UP BOY hahaha oh god i'm crying Much appreciated. The gif was good, but the video is so much better. xD Sound effects! Therea a reason this post has a bunch of upvotes and comments. I assume most people upvoting this repost havent seen it yet.

 Honestly whats the difference between one day and one month? This is the internet once its out there its out there. You can't expect people to just follow some sort of rules.

- Is it a few months old?

- Has it been reposted recently?

- Give credit to creator. Dont know creator? Ask in comments or dont repost it. 

- Dont change content in anyway.

- Post as originally intended by creator.

Shit would never get spread around the internet if people followed the rules that people make up for posting someone elses content. Exactly most of the reposts I see is only because of people complaining about reposts. Otherwise its the first time im seeing it and im upvoting cause I like it. I dont give a fuck if there was another post yesterday this post is active and I can discuss the content I just saw for the first time. I'm like 

*Just hit the 'hide' button and move on with your day.* That's something a synth would say Warning: Do not try to fuck the nuclear warhead xD Spam. Trying to get views on his freebooting YouTube channel. I dunno, but it just makes me like him even more I haven't played 4 yet despite pouring hundreds of hours into 3 and NV. I have to sometime.  It was no problem in 2! Is that a good one? I'm looking to get my grandson a video game for Christmas. He is 13. I'm aware the story vaguely exists having never really completed the game, but when I woke up and realized it was decades later, I figured my son would have been dead and continued to help out Potatoes Gravy for a while until I got sick of his shit and set him on fire with a plasma rifle. Can't tell if you're serious or not. Is that seriously a serious criticism? Are people seriously complaining that an open-ended game is open-ended? Oh I see Woah, that's so clean, how'd you do that?  

Oh, by the way, it looks like you dropped this: e

Is it yours?  M'taphore *tips fedora* These puns are getting a little harry. no, stealth melee/unarmed.  People don't notice you until you're uppercutting them into space, or a supersledge/powerfist is being introduced to their face.  It's a lot of fun. Did you start with Skyrim / Fallout 3? Because before Skyrim, sniping /archery was fucking hard in ES. survival with 1 endurance?!

I don't think I could do it.   FO4 is a pretty good game.  If you like fallout 3, you'll like fallout 4, probably.  Not worth paying full price at this point, and the DLCs are hit or miss depending on how much you like base building, but overall its a decent game.

Just missing some of the RPG components fallout needs.   but that is ridiculously easy if you have even decent aim or a weapon with high fire rate... brb. Okay you lazy bones. I posted up a Gif, now where's my Karma?  
https://www.reddit.com/r/gif/comments/5fob8q/chernobyl_arch_moving_over_the_nuclear_reactor/ You mean [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/5fnwhy/time_lapse_of_the_chernobyl_arch_moving_into/)? Holy shit, you're not kidding. What do with all that karma? Teach me your ways, Ancient One We're proud of you and the service you provide. Found some good subreddits that you post to. Thanks stranger. Some pretty good content none the less
 Atleast is one word. I can't exactly get compressed air cans due to living out in the Alaskan bush and the airlines not allowing them on small planes. I can try and use a dusting brush for electronics I have.  Gingers... me too They responded to me about the few month wait and it mad me think why does it matter too. Here's my thought.

Always give credit when you can. If you repost right away and don't give credit you may take views away from the original author. If you repost after some time then you could possibly be giving views to the author that at that point they wouldn't have gotten.  That doesn't look like anything to me. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) and yet he is still upvoted smfh Dude, I just started yesterday, same as you, hundreds of hours. 

It is an *amazing* improvement in so many ways. I was worried cause people kept shitting on the settlement building feature, but I find that mildly enjoyable anyway, and it *seems* like you can totally ignore that aspect of the game. And if you do that...

Feral ghouls. They're fucking terrifying. They come at you like the zombies in 28 days later. It's horrifying.

Crafting. Actually useful now. I'm going a crafting build and I don't bother picking up guns anymore, I just scrap stuff to upgrade my guns into boomcannons. 

Sniping. Actually works. I don't seem to be punished severely by RNG. 

 Yeah, VATS in Fallout 2 was the best! I can always trust you, grandma. I'd say it's good for a 13 year old. It has minor drug references but they serve a purpose. It's generally regarded as a very enjoyable game.  Rocket League For a thirteen year old yeah it's fine. Make sure he doesn't have it already though, it's quite a popular game.  One of the most popular games of 2015 and 2016. Yeah I'd get the game for him, the majority of people love it. It's one of my favorite games too! Let me know if you decide to buy it for him (you should)

edit: I feel cheated. I genuinely got excited GTA 5 is a great game for your 13 year old grandson. Others are failing to mention that it has pretty frequent R rated language. It's not excessive, but when the main character takes a stat-enhancing drug, he screams "FUCKIN' KILLLLL!!!!" And other bad guys also throw out the occasional F bomb. 

So if you care about that, maybe avoid the game for a 13 year old. 

But to answer your question: Yes, I think it's a very good game.  It's a very good game. Highly recommend it Yes, but make sure he has the right system. This game is only for Sega Genesis No Man's Sky is really popular with the kids nowadays and it is probably on sale Can't go wrong with Rocksmith 2014.


E: Oh yeah, I forgot that if a game teaches you something it's not a game. Sorry guys. Grandpa is a total badass. He vapes guys!  Paw paw? It's pretty good yeah. It's an action game with a big world to explore and a lot of stuff to do. If your grandson likes it he would probably get a lot of value out of it. Get your grandson a pc for Christmas Are you still cig free?
 Very violent and lots of blood but if you're okay with that its a decent game.

If this was bait, I definitely took it. Get him "Battletoads". Gamestop always has them in stock. Nah, get him "Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge". It's the shit for young kids these days. Get him half life 3 if he plays on computer, get him a steam gift card, seriously it is really the best gift around this time of year for a pc gamer. If he is on a console fallout 4 is a great gift if he doesn't already have it, i would recommend battlefield 1 it recently came out and there is a better chance he doesn't have it yet. If hes never played fallout get him fallout 3 and fallout new vegas I love it. If he's into open world games (like skyrim and that sort of thing), then he likely will too. It's more of an action game than an rpg, which is why you'll see a good number of people who were disappointed by it. That being said, the game has fairly intense violence (heads exploding, limbs flying off, etc.) and a good number of mature themes. Nothing super intense though, but enough that if his parents aren't a fan of him playing that kind of stuff it could be a problem. Oh, and if he'd play it on a computer, it'll take a decent rig to run it. It's a fucking amazing game Hell yeah Damn you have a grandson and youre on reddit? My grama doesnt even know how to use her phone Depends if he doesn't have it then buy it for him  You don't know how long it's been since he was unfrozen. When they steal him they refreeze you after. It could have been the same day for all you know.  Archery in oblivion is the cause of my future aneurysm  Honestly, considering how much damage both you and your enemies can output, it really seems like such a meaningless thing to build endurance when other perks are so much more powerful in comparison. I figured it was better to go realistic as survival mode intended it to be and just go full stealth sniper, as damage downrange and silence is more useful, and just make sure you aren't ever hit by always hitting first, and always kill on hit. Pretty much my plan. Just checked your post history and was incredibly disappointed that you hadn't posted a gif version What I feel few people understand is that it's not that I like karma because I think it's some sort of currency. I'm not some ape sitting at a computer. I just happen to like Reddit as a hobby. I do it during work breaks or if I make a big development. It makes *me* happy to open a Reddit tab and see all the mail and upvotes and stuff.

I get lots of hate mail just for having a bunch of karma, but it's just a fun hobby to me. GOOD point.  But you live in Alaska. Just put your graphics card outside How do people ship stuff to you ? I mean a [bulb syringe](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bulb-Syringe-Aspirator/39791322) and some softer tools (toothpicks, q-tips, toothbrushes, etc.) work just as well.  Just want to get most of the dust off carefully without damaging the fans. Compressed air is good, but leaves dust all over the room and up in the air when you're done. I usually just take my small floor vac to it with the tube nozzle (make sure the computer's off first!). When you get it at the right angle you can make the fan spin so you don't have to change positions to reach all the dust. In my experience, this nifty little tool is a great substitute for compressed air cans:

 What speed is ur internet lol do u have pics of your street? Im from England just interested, thanks. Air compressor? Living in the bush you must have one Meanwhile I'm getting a meager but dignified sum of upvotes. The settlement building feature could stand some improvement, like a toggle to turn off walls snapping to each other. Sometimes you just wanna build that awkward obtuse corner, y'know?

And yeah, feral ghouls actually feel like a threat now. They were irritating in the previous games, but now that they can crawl out from under cars and run at you at about mach 3, fuck fuck fuck fuck. Ditto deathclaws, which do a better job leveling with the player, and Supermutant Suiciders. I don't know what sound causes me to search more frantically for its source, the growl of a ghoul or that mini nuke beep.

Big shout out to the six crank laser musket with a long scope, best sniping weapon I've built so far. I just hate what they did to the conversation choices. Everything else felt fine. Honestly I enjoyed it too at the start. I just ended up getting really sick of the lack of proper dialogue, the repetitive quests, and the lack of any sort of real endgame for settlements ( sure you can settle everything and try to keep them all happy... But why? It's a lot of effort for absolutely nothing.. They even keep giving you the same exact quests).

Also a big problem was that you couldn't talk your way out of a lot of situations. In new Vegas you could get on the friendly side of almost anyone, whereas in 4 there's a lot less flexibility ( you can basically pick between the big 3 and that's it).

But in all fairness I heard far harbour is much better. I haven't tried it though. Thank god. I've heard so much hate and how fucking terrifying the feral ghouls are alone is an improvement. I went into a metro tunnel and saw it filled with ghouls and booed the fuck out when I first started playing. Sure it's not a perfect game but it is a blast imo and yes the settlement building wasn't perfect but it was fun and hopefully gets improved on in future installments. I wish attacks were more large scale kind of sucked when you'd travel back to take care of a few low level raiders that your turrets could destroy in no time at all. And if you didn't travel back it would kill a bunch of your settlers regardless. But if people want to bitch about that they should go play a game where that is the sole point of the game. I think the voice acting while cool at first  really did end up taking away from the role play aspects such as less options in conversations and quests. Too often I didn't even know exactly what was gonna be said and was disappointed that I picked that option. Granted mods fix a lot of things but it shouldn't be the solution. Hopefully Bethesda is paying attention and adapting to feedback. That being said Todd Howard did do an interview where he acknowledged some of its failures so that's a good start. Plus the campaign took away from the role play aspect as well and definitely fell flat unless you played it with a sense of urgency. Yeah, there's only a couple *required* building scenarios, but otherwise you can ignore it completely. And even if you're going full Minutemen, you can just build a generator and radio tower and then piss off. They only want you to start the settlements, you're not obligated to actually give them houses and beds and stuff. Personally I'm using the duplication of resourses to amass a robot death army for each of the settlements the story in 4 is pure shit  compared to 3.  The premise is great but it falls short hard. 

2/5 eggs
 I love it but I really wish they had more side quests and stuff because that's what made fallout really fun. Finding a vault full of Gary's is half of the adventure. I actually don't like how they changed some of the way skills and VATS work. For example.. In the old game you had gun skills that effected how VATS worked. As you got better with the skill you could use the targeting system to shoot off people's heads despite how far away they were, in cover, etc.. The new one doesn't have that. If I ADS I could shoot better than VATS.  He's right about the features but the story? You're not missing jack man.  Look at post history, this ain't no grandma I always think of grama when im starving [deleted] You're tagged as grandma from now on I better see some cookies come my way u bitch What a save!
What a save!
What a save!
[Chat Disabled for 10sec] Incoming! I second this. That is a gleaming recommendation. Thank you for your reply. I will compare prices on the amazon and decide soon.  It's also the worst Fallout game so far, in my opinion. Too linear, lacks the openness of character every other one has, etc. I hope they don't do that with the next Elder Scrolls. Make sure he has a headset so he can let everyone know he slept with their moms. ... you can litterally shoot people's limbs off or blow their head apart. or straight drop a tiny nuke on them. 
but you're right... hearing the word fuck is probably the worst thing about it...  You're a goddam demon One of those games I would never buy but would be cool to get as a gift.  He said when he realised it was a lot later. You find out pretty quickly when you talk to Cogs. Oh, /u/BlueDrache hasn't posted it? brb. you mean goodpoint Or even better. Cut two holes in wall. Place computer next to wall. Fit tubes to intake and exhaust of computer to each hole. Enjoy your 0c over clocked computer.  Oh you; if I did that I'd probably get stolen by a polar bear.  Oh we get packages through FedEx, UPS and the postal service. The airlines just have to follow guidelines as to what they can and cannot ship; these are small planes that can only hold so much.  Okay, I'll give that a try.  * Removed untrue information * Hmm, I'll see if that works.  I had ghouls crawl out from the ceiling before. Happened a couple times exploring caves, they'd crawl out of a ceiling that had no hole or crevice.  I have that musket but with a legendary effect that does plus 50% damage against humans. I found it to be completely overpowered until I reached level 30. Now its sitting in my weaponchest at Sanctuary because it took me 4 shots in the head to kill a raider. 4 shots using the crank reload.... you know you can get an infinite ammo laser musket right? you would need to crank once for every piece of ammo if your inventory BUT it theoretically has the highest damage potential of any weapon in the entire game. It really made the game so much worse for me.  That has always been one of the best features in those games. As a nub who hasn't touched Fallout and was going to use 4 as an intro, what did they do to the conversations that made it so bad? I got the season pass and for some reason far harbor just didn't interest me, Nuka world on the other hand was great. It gives you the option to be a raider which I found far more entertaining than going with the "good guy" route. Unfortunately the quests get repetitive but eventually you start to understand which are their "dynamically generated quests" or whatever they call them, and which are real quests. I found the real ones to all be pretty good, and would do the generated ones whenever i wanted to get a quick level here and there.  I just turned each settlement into an artillery battery. So no matter where I am on the map I can pummel something out of existence. "Go fuck a bagel" He.... posted to r/watchpeopledie. He is one hardcore grandma.  I checked out post history.

Maybe bitter alcoholic grandma?  Is it a grandpa? You mean I can't trust him?!?! I'm 100% certain he *is* the 13 year old boy. Can't trust anyone  His name? Ken M. >the amazon

Grandma confirmed. You have a strange comment history for an old lady  Make sure he doesnt already have it! Its popular Make sure he doesnt already have it! Its popular GO fuck a bagel gamma May I ask if you plan to buy it on PC?

The modding scene is starting to come out more on console(xbox, ps4), but most of the (tens of thousands) of mods are on PC. If your grandson is technically inclined enough to do a little adjustment and tinkering (there are many tools that do this automatically, it's quite simple) he can easily increase the amount of content he gets to play.

Regardless, Fallout 4 is an amazing game regardless of platform, if a little buggy at times. This game came out last year, though the caliber of game is alright, a 13 year old would probably prefer a newer game. Battlefield 1 just came out and, unless he already has it, he would probably prefer it over fallout 4. Fallout 4 has no multiplayer aspect, and though fun for the first couple hours, the flaw to the game is that it is very repetitive. I think that unless he explicitly asks for fallout 4 not buy it, and buy a newer game such as Battlefield 1 instead

Source: 19 year old with a 13 year old brother do you know the password for the amazon? do I need a password? oh crimeney gee'willickers, I hate these memory issues I'm having these days.  And dont get them started if there is a womans breasts involved! Wont somebody think of the children?!?!? My 13 year old brother swears more than any human being I know when he's with his friends Everytime I mention it, gets backlash and I dont know why. It's a good game and it teaches you guitar. Quite easily and quickly too. Talking to cogs only reveals you've been sleeping for over a century. He doesn't say anything regarding how long it's been since your kid was taken. The Lone Survivor doesn't find out about it until later. Just checked your post history and was incredibly disappointed that you hadn't posted a gif version Serious question though: how cold is too cold for your computer? For whatever reason I had the mental image of hundreds of dollars in PC parts being airdropped from a small plane No, it won't. Reversing the direction of angular rotation does not reverse the power flux direction. In order to switch a motor to a generator, you only have to spin it in any direction fast enough to produce induced voltage. 

Because of this, motors are usually wired up with fly-back diodes in order to keep the induced current flowing through it (and to reduce the necessary current needed to spin, but that's another story). Additionally, motherboard fans can usually only spin in one direction (they have a protection diode in series with the motor, so it can spin in one direction). 

Edit: induced current 

Source: Electronics and Electrical Machines courses     Yeah, I've seen that. It's annoying as hell, but it keeps me on my toes. In FO3 about the time you hit level 20 you could walk through the Capital Wasteland like a god of death, but in FO4 I'm level 60 and still finding reasons to run for cover. The Fallout games, escpecially 1, 2 and New Vegas had some of the wittiest dialog choices of all time for any game series. Oh, I didn't know about that. That's actually pretty cool, that's the sort of thing I was missing from the main game! Oh grandma My grandma would probably say that though.  I'm ready "Fuck your cat. It's a cunt of a cat." Definitely cant_trust_him Why does that exist >chunky plumpler

What on God's green Earth is this  Look at her comment history. She's no grandma lol.  I ain't no lady, pal :) My sole interest in this thread is now whether your double posted comments continue gaining karma equally I wouldn't say Fallout 4 is "fun for a few hours". The game is designed to have replayability, I probably have like 7 days on it or more. forwardsfromgrandma/iamverysmart reminiscent RAM joke The problem I had with rocksmith is that I got quite good at the game so I decided to unplug and play the songs on a real amp.

And I sounded like fucking shit because the game doesn't really care if you sound out your chords properly.

Admittedly I was getting really good at stuff that didn't involve chords though. Yea, seems cool to me. I just don't know that I'd be good enough to justify the cost for myself.  Wow, neither of them did it? Pfft, rookies. brb. [Tech Quickie video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuP6I0mOb1s)

Thank you that's good to know. I was just going with what I've heard and thought it to be true. cheers Didn't FO3 also originally have a level cap around 20 or so? I remember telling some guy in Fallout 1 that I was only there to kick ass and chew bubblegum and I was all out of gum, and he got very, very upset with me. I then had to wipe out his whole village except for the kids, which I don't think you can kill. Yeah same here, I found the 3 main story factions really boring so I'm glad nuka world included it. I wish it was part of the main game and not DLC because I would have loved to start my character as a raider instead of "ok I tried all 3 factions and they suck, so Fuck it, looks like I'm going to be a raider" Classic grandma "That's nice, dear" > WOW!!!

That's because you aren't supposed to rely on just Rocksmith to learn how to play the guitar perfectly.



If you want to learn to play the guitar accurately you have to practice in your own time. Or you can just play Rocksmith for fun and still learn the basics.

My favorite thing is the PC version. A community makes Custom DLC for download And they are fantastic. Like 27,000+ songs or something like that

That's why I think its a good game.  And so the disappointment continues  Wow he didnt do it
The absolute madman! That's fine! It's a common misconception though. Have a great day! Kirov reporting. Since no one else did, here's the source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGtrJaiUZaA Tropico 6 VR is gonna be sick if it ever happens. Welp, this is rad. I have played all of the C&C games and have always wanted it to somehow stay relevant. This is the best way to do it. 

Also it would be awesome if it would act like an old time-ie war board where you and the other commander can talk (or shit talk) while in battle. Kind of a cool idea. 

Edit: holy cow gonna check out openRA when I get home!! Suddenly I am actually interested in VR. I really didn't care at all before, but an RTS would be awesome. On holo on a take would feel like being a general in a sci foo movie. I suddenly want starcraft in VR.  Can we get Black & White in VR now please !?! Rollercoaster Tycoon!!!! one can dream  Before you shit on it, this is the work of a single hungarian guy doing it for fun. 

It's an impressive demonstration what VR is capable of if you are not a lazy ass mofo. Pretty soon, I guess we won't have to worry about how to make RTS games work for gamepads anymore.  For me, this is the future of VR. Please stop with the "experiences" which are just areas that you can wander in for a bit and then get bored. Along the same lines, not every VR game has to be 1st person. Why can't "I" be Lakitu in my cloud floating behind mario? 3rd person games should work whether the camera is bound to your head motions or a right analogue stick. Clunky interfaces make me wish that voice commands were a thing in strategy games. You guys... I don't even know what to say right now. I play Red Alert 2 / Yuri's Revenge *every single day*. I don't know why. My brother played it when it came out and we were growing up, and I just kept playing it and never moved on. I love this game so fucking much. I love constantly challenging myself (don't make fun of me... I know that challenging myself in this game is hard to do after playing it for so long, that's why I stagger out how often I download user-made maps) and the familiarity I get from playing it. Not many people in my life knows what this is and when I find people who played it, I get so excited. 

I don't know what this post is, but my heart stopped when I saw the words "Red Alert 2" on the front page. And I recognized the buildings. This is my game. THIS IS MY GAME!! I'm so happy right now. This made my night. 

Yes. I am lame.  Unit ready.    
Unit ready.     
Unit ready. wow this actually looks really awesome
 I suddenly care about VR. I never even THOUGHT about RTS where you stand on top of the map like that. WTF THIS IS AWESOME. I feel like you're playing with a little living toys that are made to look like an RTS video game? Bigups to Westwood Studios my favorite game studio of all time. [deleted] The nostalgia is real. Is it done, Yuri ? how do i play this Koreans triggered by not being able to go to 150+ APM I love Red Alert 2 Yuri Revenge >5 minutes of novelty

"Fuck me this sucks ass" looks cool but would be a really bad interface for rts. looks fucking tedious. Still waiting for a Magic the Gathering VR game VR makes RTS look appealing to me Seeinng this... i wanna play VR Black and White Oh my god the controls look awful, I could only imagine the nightmare of combat. This looks like a really shitty way to play a RTS... This could be the thing to convince me to buy VR Now that I've seen your ore factory, let me see you war factory. Ahhhhh... I was just thinking about this game the other day. Such a classic. Dwarf Fortress VR please with actual graphics. But can I jump into the first person perspective of an enemy soldier running into my horde of German Shepherd attack dogs? Holy shit this is awesome!!! God i want to play civ on vr now Screw VR, I just want Red Alert 2 in the Unreal engine. Finally! I've wanted an RTS like this since oculus was announced. I think Planetary Annihilation would be even better with room scale VR, watching the planets fly around the sun while you move your units. sometimes I realize  how bad I want vr. Then I remember how broke I am and I go back to shitposting about how its a fad I never knew how much I wanted this until now.  This just really adds to the element of seeming like a god. Perfect for Black and white. Black & White VR! Eh, it's not Red Alert 2 to me. Am I the only one that would prefer mouse and keyboard over this clunky implementation of an RTS game? Mouse and keyboard are just so much faster and more precise. Good luck competing at any real level using VR in any RTS game ever. Red alert 1 is one of my favorite games of all time. Its a shame the newer games could never live up to it.  If they did this for age of empires. I would buy it instantly. maybe it just me, but this doesn't make sense as VR. I'm still pointing at a screen the placing items on a map from above, its like a VR of someone playing the original game... Age ...Of ....Empires.....Imagine standing above an army of charging Frank Paladins or behind the great sieging of a teuton city using lines of trebuchets....The beauty...The chaos....I need this now... This is unreal I guess I'm just old, but I'm not impressed here.  So instead of a mouse you use a VR pointer and instead of a menu you have a VR tablet with a menu.  The most impressive thing I think, that's not really shown, is the ability to view the entire map at once. *clicking nervously* STOP EVERYTHING, BUILD IFV OR FLAK TRACK WE WILL BURY THEM DESOLATOR READY FOR MADER RASSIA UNIT LOST High speed, low drag "I don't give a hootin' nickle about your legacy! Now you call them off!...Demitri... you know we'll retaliate." Bombardiers to your stations.  

  *Why don't you drive?* At least I have job.  Disk in flight. This gun is heavy Shake it baby Thank you for the new shoes Man with something like this I really think this would work really well with AR like the Hololens. Just being able to walk around a table seeing everything from all sides would be incredible.  I can just have this video playing in the background to listen to soundtrack & commands. That alone brings back so many fond memories. More so if you can walk the streets of your own city that you've built 

Edit: corrected autocorrect  Bring on Roller Coaster Tycoon as well! Age of Empires will be god like
 You know, I have Red Alert on my laptop and it still holds up! Yuri's revenge should get a facelift and should also be ported to Android. I wish someone with power saw this. *new construction options!*

OT, I can't wait for all this stuff. When I'm old and in an elderly home, I'm going to play all day long. Right about then I will finally have the time to play Battlefield 1

 > Welp, this is rad. I have played all of the C&C games and have always wanted it to somehow stay relevant. 

OpenRA I play it all the time with my buddy still.
https://cncnet.org/ Wow what great memories I have of those games. I really liked Generals and thought the replay value  was amazing. When it started to get stale I would do stuff like modify my spies so they could plant nuclear C4 that would level half the map.  Lol it was so much fun Can I get a C&C Renegade shoutout

 You need one of those long wooden sticks to move the people around too.  Gotta try onward the fps for vr Out of Ammo is my go to for my RTS fill. Be the god commander and look down over the battlefield while being tasked with setting up base infrastructure and assigning your units to the placements. Stay up there and watch the battle unfold or jump in to first person as any of your peeps and take on the enemy yourself. 

Personally, I enjoy hopping into a crow's nest as a sniper when the shit hits the fan. 


Onward is really fun as well, and does a great job of showing just how versatile the Vive controllers can be, though it is quite challenging and tends to give me some nausea because of the movement system.  I really want a 40K table top in VR. I'll take Warcraft 4 as well, thank you. APM would be so terrible the game wouldn't be close to what it is like now. Would be fun though, just a lot different. APM intensive games like RA2 or SC would seems awkward and tiring on VR or at least with Vive. Slower paced games like Wargames series would be better I think. I just want a World of Starcraft, or a Starcraft movie.

I don't want too much. Once the VR tech matures a bit we are going to see a lot of world changing games. Esports would be SO much more exciting to spectate in VR. rts in vr sounds horrible this is the first time I've seen something VR-related that I'd actually want to play. Sign me up for that VR-RTS.

Thinking about it some more, I'd also indulge in VR porn. No shame Yes on this B&W was practically made for VR! I had started making something like this but I dropped the project as I couldn't come up with a compelling game loop that worked in VR.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LMeGxwlE7E

Granted mine was a little different (I really liked the idea of ordering citizens around, and then being able to BECOME them) but I couldn't make it work. That was before motion controls though.

It'd be nice to see what others can come up with. I believe we all want VR animal abuse my friend.  So you wanna be God now?  "we NEED food!"

 I was thinking of that. Black & White was practically made for VR, from the weird ground-dragging mouse controls to the gestures you can use to equip spells. It was ahead of its time. Imagine being able to pull your creature along on a leash with the motion controls rather than a mouse. 2026. That would be amazing!  Simcity...Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-Earth2...KSP, please? The devs of rct2 & 3 are currently working on planet coaster, a new roller coaster Sim game. Would be neat if they added vr to that I want to get off Mr Bones Wild Ride It's not RCT, but in Chunks you have a tool to make roller coasters, you can even sit on them in first person and "ride"  them.  My wife fell while standing riding one  What if your a group of lazy ass mofos that managed to do this? What are you then? I was actually blown away, I figure he's only re-using gaphical/audio assets since the map is in actual 3d and its probably easier to re-make the bulk of the game in these modern fancy shmangled  engines... which is fekkin' impressive. But instead on playstation move? > Why can't "I" be Lakitu in my cloud floating behind mario?

Mainly because of puke.  Old school dungeon crawls like. Grid based movement, real time, or turn based. with interactive puzzles and secrets.  Party or individual based.

For a recent game.  Think Legend of Grimrock.  

That's what I want from VR. Pac Man 2: Adventure did this.  You weren't pac man,  but a spectator with a sling shot to influence events around Pac Man to make him happy, sad, or angry in order to solve puzzles.  A modern VR game like that would be awesome! I think you're on to something here There are already a few games that work like this.  Lucky's Tale and Edge of Nowhere to name a couple.  Some people can get sick from the camera moving by itself in VR but these games try to minimize that with slow, smooth movement.  And then there's the argument over whether making games for VR that could very well just be played on a monitor is worth it.

I just tell people to try WindWaker in DolphinVR and decide whether that would be something you'd like to see more of.  Being the camera can do a lot for immersion even in games designed for a flat monitor. I don't know man, I think you could get sick from that quickly lol It's VR every single experience is 1st person by it's nature.

There are 3d games that exist already that do what you want.

On the Rift you have a platformer named lucky's tale, you also have games like Final Approach where you direct planes into an airport for landing, combat core is a fighting game. I believe there are a couple of VR side scrollers.

VR is still incredibly new and the really great ideas are going to be a good while away still as we refine the technology and figure out it's strengths and weaknesses.

I'd love a VR Yu-Gi-Oh style game where I can walk around duelist kingdom and make giant monsters fight it out but until someone with the skills and budget to make a quality title like that shows up it ain't going to happen. Especially while the market for VR is still very small. Do it, vr is still in its infancy, and ripe for development  Making games is time consuming, its going to take some time before those 80+ hour vr games everyone dreams of are going to come out, VR is in its baby stages right now and almost no one knows what all the right ways of doing things are yet.  Have you tried PSVR?  The Playroom VR has a platformer level that is very reminiscent of Mario and that's essentially how the camera works.  You float around behind your character, just like Lakitu.  It's really fun, and a person with a second controller can control a character on the main screen that can help open doors and things.


It's essentially a demo, but it shows that it can be done. I think all the experiences are devs experimenting and prototyping to see what works before committing to anything. Committing to a game that bombs can be a death sentence for a studio, and I suppose maybe the studios that are so big that they can afford to do this probably don't care to innovate. But yeah, this looks fucking rad, I want total war vr all the way. It's like any new technology, artists are still figuring out how to implement it. I agree.. Wayward Sky has been my favorite PSVR release. I would love something similar to this for a Civ game. Still waiting for VR 3rd person games. Ratchet and Clank were my favorite games when I was a kid. Ever play Tom Clancy's Endwar? Not an RTS like C&C is, but [here you go](http://store.steampowered.com/app/319740/) Eventually they'll develop something that can track your bare hands with a camera (a la the Kinect) and then it'll feel a lot more natural. These are just the most reliable way to track hand movements at the moment. Days like these make me wish for a nuclear winter Mouse and keyboard with VR would be less clunky than hand held thingys... I grew up with command and conquer, and this comment made me shed a single manly tear. To see someone who cares about even one of the games as much as i care about the series makes me so happy. I'm the same with C&C Renegade! We still have a fantastic tight-knit online community a few thousand strong. After almost a decade of playing with the same people, I recognize nearly everyone's username when they enter the sever My friend introduced me to the game 14 years ago. I remember playing brutal campaign with a warm coat on and something warm to drink. Every mission a new adventure. Or play 1v1v1v1 with my friends over LAN.
 
Once in a while I pull the game out of the closet, read the back and think of all the good times I had. Then I'll put it back and feel strangely sad, like I will never experience something so special again. Thanks Red Alert 2 I will never forget you. And for the one moment /u/mwbrjb was king of the world.

He died the next day. First, you are my hero. But second, could I trouble you for some tips on setting up good skirmishes? I've gotten stuck in a rut that I think explains why I only ever binge on RA2 but don't play consistently any more.

Basically, I only ever play maps with oil derricks because the ore always runs out before I can build an obscene amount of turrets and high end units. I also almost always play as Yuri with at least one ally so I can borrow their conyard and enjoy the tech synergy.

Ok basically I'm a god damn turtle and I need help. Unit lost. Unit ready. Unit lost. Construction complete. Low power.  We will bury them. I'm Ron Burgundy? /r/commentgore Yeah, it really seems like the small unsteady motions of a free hand will really hamper the user experience, especially for a game where quick and precise actions must be taken. This is why a mouse is a great device; the weight of the mouse coupled with a smooth contact area gives the necessary precision without limiting freedom of movement too much.  Dude. Come on. "The nostalgia is unreal." The [actual video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGtrJaiUZaA) is even better with the music + sound.

Engineering.

Engineering.

Moving.

Yes sir! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b5X69vREAg

You're welcome. No, Comrade Premier. It has only begun. Doesn't look playable to me. Baby steps. VR guy here, surprisingly not as tedious as it looks. (Probably after loooong periods of time though). This was my thought. It also doesn't look like it would be nearly as responsive as hotkeys and mouse. It would definitely be something I'd love to try though. Just not in any form of competitive way. well, yeah.  I can't imagine VR being great in terms of micro/macro in a similar fashion like keyboard and mouse can achieve for traditional competitive rts.

However it's still an awesome concept to be explored further, with hopefully less "actions per minute" type RTS being developed with VR in mind.  I love my Vive, but it needs to start working on titles outside the realm of wave shooters (which are awesome, the new serious sam was is super fun, but we need some title variety) Imagine the Total War series. Oh god my computer just dies from playing that game for 3-4 hours. Rest in peace PC if it has to render 3D and VR... I feel like this would be better as an option for spectators rather than players. Far too slow. RA2 was fucking incredible don't you dare disrespect it (not too fond of Yuri's Revenge though).  But yes RA 3 was absolute garbage. Time to send that one engineer they are all auto targeting 100 miles away from my base!  After I saw this gif yesterday, I decided to break out RA2 and that's exactly what happened. Thank god they're cheap and fast to build. a clone center and 60 flak troopers and you're good An aegis will destroy them all on its own. Did you know they fire faster if you manually target?
 Came for red alert 2 references. Was not disappointed. Conscript reporting I'm here. *I'm gone.*  
Never existed.  
- Chrono Legionnaire, 2000-present. There goes the neighbourhood! it will be a silent sprring. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA - Tanya It will be a silent spring. Little C-4, Knockin' at Your Door! It will soon be a wasteland.

-best unit in the game Spread the doom! The Apocalypse has begun Spread the goo! Hey hey watch it! Vee vill berryy demm. Rrrr-ruff! Settling in. I actually have this and "Incoming Transmission" saved to my phone as text alert sounds. It takes me back to the good ol' days. Out of all the quotes this one I heard loud and clear in my head as if I was playing bombadiers to their stations. Holy nostalgia  Got a clear view Never existed. Ah man, picture Warhammer showing you your movement radius, you move the models it brings up firing options, you roll dice and it picks up on the rolls and does animations for the attack.

I need this in my life The RTS genre might be coming back from the dead. Wooo! There's VR game called Final Approach where you're controlling an airport. Setting plans to land, refuel, repair, take off. Airport management stuff, but you're a giant above the airport and it's one of the most fun games I have in VR. it also extends to a lot more than just those examples. Cities where you're fighting aliens lol.. but yeah this standing like a giant above, moving around is amazing in VR. I'd rather do it sitting in a chair with a mouse and keyboard.  I mean, who wants to run from the front lines back to base in person constantly for a 30 minute game?

VR has to prove itself a *better* interface than mouse and keyboard, and that's a tough challenge.  That's the exact problem that touch controls have.  They're *worse* than mouse and keyboard.  The only place they're used consistently is where there's no room for those input devices.
 The way the "interface" looks, I was thinking VR would be a good fit, too. Simcity2000's map compatibility with SimCopter and Streets of Sim City is finally coming back around. make the riot/military attacks first person shooters?
 [deleted] I'm waiting for Grand Theft SimCity. Planet Coaster please! Finally get to experience [this puppy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GpCaK8ISSYA&feature=youtu.be)  firsthand!  I remember some roller coaster game that had a built in way to ride the coasters. Can't remember for the life of me what it was. I want to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride. Unfortunately, EA holds the rights to the C&C franchise and after C&C4, no one would trust EA with another title. con-sript repor-ding Will it work on windows 10? I miss playing it That looks like just RA1 tho right? Oh god. Thank you for this.  Oh yes, good times!! That's the game that I really want to try. Looks awesome All ready exists. Table Top simulator has VR support. Get a few workshop mods and you are set to go. I kinda like the aspect of physical models in 40k and games like it. Once 3D printing takes care of Games Workshop bleeding us dry, it'll be perfect. I just want a holographic table for my tabletops. Extra please with a side of prayers. Loved that fucking game. Custom games for days. The one where ya defeat the titan. Dota. Island of frogs vamp beast I miss em all I've been waiting almost a decade for WC4. I hope it becomes a thing.  You mean Warcraft 3? Man, I just want it on my iPad. That would be awesome. You've never played Starcraft on the Nintendo 64 have you? Goody would be godly.  You assume I've got an apm over .5 anything turn based would be awesome

XCOM 3, Civilization 7, Heroes of Might and Magic 8 battles would be sick, Total War Medieval 3 where you get to possess a spearman and stab fuckers I don't care if it's realtime battles Yeah, but I don't want to have wargame chat in my vr dive. There are people who play Starcraft 2 with a single digit APM. To bad that Nova game never got released. Have you looked at [Starcraft Universe](http://www.upheavalarts.com/)?  World of Starcraft > Anything post vanilla WoW Rip lionshead studios. Rip black and white. [Indeed it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tICxuvdVR3Q&t=0m33s) Cat beater 2016 Hell yeah I wanna throw people across the land. And burn them. Burn them all Yeah you haven't seen my very explosion-prone KSP craft, I wouldn't want to pilot any of those! As they also do Elite: Dangerous which supports VR in the same engine, actually plausible! EA? Hello Games.

^^^kidding. ^^^sort ^^^of. [Ruse on PS3](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SLnVGlWAzhU) used the move. It was a bit clunky, but also super immersive.  Yeah Mario was a bad example. Something without fluid motion, and actually built for VR though. My point was that games don't have to be 1st person.

I have plans to eventually make a 3rd person space station game, which would allow for non-teleporting movement and avoid sickness. (floating in zero-g has no acceleration to make us motion sick)  Or better yet, there is a VR table top RPG demo similar to the Virtual Tabletop platform where you have animated kobolds and beholders and visible spells and attacks by your characters, all by rolling virtual dice. I mean, rogue and nethack VR would be fun, but the social experience of a Dungeons and Dragons game augmented with realtime CGI in a virtual environment with your long distance buddies is such a better and more fulfilling time than the lame VR "shooting range" or "scuba dive" experiences that get stale after an hour.  A jet plane.  Don't know when I'll be back again.  Somebody get Nintendo on the phone! It depends on how the camera is controlled.  If you follow the character but have no direct control of the camera, it's probably fine.  It's when people try to do things like spin really fast that things can get messy. God damn that was an awesome game. Voice command was still too young to be viable at the time, but nowadays it would totally work.  I did. Still trying to load my squads into apc. Was fun but way too slow in that game. That would suck for people that haven't memorized their keyboard You haven't even tried the new control scheme... ME TOO. Seriously! I just love it so much. 

I would *never* tell any of my previous boyfriends (yep! I'm a girl!) that *this* is what I do in my free time. How can you explain that? But my current boyfriend, while he's never played it, thinks it is awesome. I tell him "gonna go kill some soviets!" and he thinks it is just hilarious. I love trying to explain the game to him... "you see, there's this guy named Yuri..." BUT! As a movie buff, he LOVES that Ray Wise is the president!  hell yes. fellow lame dude checking in. i still dream of beating my old buddy at command and conquer. so many hours of dial-up spent trying to beat him. so many towers of nod to take down with mammoth tanks...so many failures. ever checked out RenegadeX. Love Renegade as well and was pleased to see the online community still playing. I was so happy when I found RenegadeX. That is seriously awesome! 

I only played online a few times and got absolutely demolished. Like, "are there cheats? because this is INSANE. How in the WORLD do they have 15 apocalypse tanks within 4 minutes of the game!?!?!" so I just never re-visited it. I don't think the copy I have now even supports online gaming but maybe I'll try... Oh man! Why don't you play it? Too many other good games? 

I just never moved on. Once my brother moved out, I just wasn't exposed to anything. But I also just loved RA2 so much that it was enough for me.  SHE!  I...  I heard the voice when I read these.  Conscript reporting.... Da. Who put that question mark up there?  You think that, but using something like this is as pinpoint accurate as you could imagine. You're more accustomed to using the mouse. Imagine the same number of hours using a vive controller. Similarly, a person using a mouse for the first time is arguably less accurate then them using a vive controller.  "The nostalgia is real, the engine is not" Fuck man the music in RA2 was SO GOOD Da!

Your wish is my command!

Moving out!

For mother Russia!

Such a memorable game RTS guy here, broke out into a sweat at the thought of trying to issue an attack command on a single moving unit with that thing. Perhaps tedious, but I'll be damned if I don't have a great time playing it. It's just so unbelievably satisfying. Of course it isn't as quick as using hot keys on a keyboard, but I really don't think the person actually playing would complain one bit. 

Regular games make me push toward the objective in a rushed manner. VR, on the other hand, lets me soak in the experience of being there. 

I'm with you, VR brethren.  If the dev ever makes it multi-threaded we wouldn't have the issues we have now with it. My guess is that will happen in the future, but how soon, who knows? Even though I might get shit on over this, I think that RA3 is a good game. Previous games were certainly better but the only reason it gets flak (lol) is because it didn't really live up to the hype of previous titles. But goddamn the water was beautiful in that game Not to be confused with the two engineers that are standing just outside the back of my base that pose the largest threat and must be nutrilized with their super weapons.  OMG, did the AI always target engineers??? I need to go back in time and tell 12-yr-old me that.

TIL...several years and hundreds of skirmishes later. Now Chrono teleport enemy units into water and if they have an aircraft carrier teleport it to land. Instant death to all of them. Shit out of luck if you're the allies. >A lil' C4 knockin' at your door Da, comrade! [ENJOY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPMDd9-Li9k) At least I have job... They're history I dropped a bomb, do you have it? #***HEAVY BREATHING*** Shake it baby. Heheh, happy birthday... Rubber Shoes in Motion I had 'Incoming Transmission' from Tiberian Sun as my text ringtone for a long time. Everyone I knew loved it and thought I had some sort of super smart phone that could talk to me. They didn't realize it was a ringtone. Can u pls pm a link to download that. I'd love to do that as well That's neat, I'm stealing this. My noitification tone is the oldschool Sonic coin grab. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqgP0wGBa_Q Watch out for the bump! Maybe is GW stopped just dumping their IP to any hackjob devs these days we will reach that point.

They are such a company of extremes...barely lend out their IP, don't diversify, start going bankrupt, then panic dump. haha warhammer would become so cheap without the warhammer. The problem is, to make a video game out of Warhammer they'd have to actually have a hard set of rules rather than the vague nightmare they currently have.

I'd feel awful for the game developers writing the game engine who had to reach out to GW 50 times a day for feedback on rules interactions, considering the players haven't been able to get any in years. As someone who still plays Starcraft, I feel obligated to be upset Did RTS ever die? we usually just get a handful of games a year steady. Actually just finished with Planetary Annihilation. good game.  Someone needs to make the best RTS game ever, Rise of Nations, in VR. That would be amazing [deleted] I'm the CEO of McDonnell Douglas I cannot believe people still remember these games.  SimCopter was and still is my favorite game ever. bring back sim copter pls I still have those games - love all of them. I didn't know they were the last ones to have that capability. reticulating splines Half the battle would be driving/walking there and waiting for those dang rebels  And assassinations. You wouldn't need VR to make that a really awesome addition Nah just walk outside in a couple months. Im so hyped for this - Im not gonna get burned with a preorder, but if they capture the feel of the original RCT this will be great.  I fear most of the good rides and stuff may be locked behind DLC, but we will see... Roller coaster tycoon 3 had this I loved C&C, and never heard of C&C4 until a year ago. Downloaded it, went to try it, and found out why. What even was that? I hate EA as much as the next guy. But they suprised me very positively in releasing older C&C games for [free](https://cncnet.org/download) and not interfering with [projects](http://www.openra.net/) that are modernizing them. C&C GENERALS ZERO HOUR FOR LIFE! Rest in peace, Westwood. :( This is happening far too often. I wish EA would just fuck off and die. >He has *taught us* well Yes. Check out openra.com The best Red Alert, of course Dune 2, CNC, and RA1. They're working on Tiberian Sun and RA2. Yeah, there are few different mods. Most popular is RA1, but there's also C&C, and they're working on RA2. WAIT WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME FUCK!!!

I bought that years ago before anything good was on there. Stoked!  But, but now I can get FIVE titans for only 3000 pounds!  It's such a deal! I'll never understand how Games Workshop is so purposely obstinate on their pricing when they know the technology that can invalidate them is progressing steadily along.  

These things were ungodly expensive when I was involved in them 12 years ago.  When I look at them now, all injection molded plastic and more expensive than ever, I just don't get it.   They should do what they did with their Lord of the rings tie in.  Every few weeks they released a magazine which had a few models, paints, brushes etc. In the magazine they showed you how to paint and play  while introducing you to the lore. I loved it as it wasn't expensive and it built up fairly quickly. Maybe they could do a loot crate style box.. I would buy that. Sooo many good ones!!! Don't forget maps like evolution, footman wars, gemTD, wilderness survival, Jurassic Park, Night of the dead, who is the killer, werewolf, D&D, & Parasite! Suprised nobody mentioned LOAP Dota and Tower Defense games were my favorite. hunters vs farmers Dota 2 has custom games now and most of those have been ported. I played the fuck out of DBZ and LOTR maps on Starcraft and War3 Island Defense and Undead Assault, pimp my peon! That would be Warcraft 3 :) warcraft 4 is not out, or even announced, you mean warcraft 3 methinks.

but yes, wc3 was an amazing game, i still have it on my laptop! Sheep tag! Sadly Warcraft's gaming future is WoW until that dies, and most likely that will the end of the world... of Warcraft WC4 will never happen for one reason: World of Warcraft.

The only way WC4 can happen is if it is in the far off future of the warcraft universe, at which case you have to account for every possible future storyline of WoW in the game. Otherwise you have to explain why the player characters in WoW have no agency in the events of WC4 considering they've been facing every other major threat to Azeroth since WoW's launch.  Without mouse and keyboard it would be so frustrating.

Source: it runs on my Surface. One of my favorite games on N64, it was still fun even with the horrible APM. Oh man, that bit where he finishes slapping the tiger and then knocks it over just for good measure. Lazy, not sadistic. I'm all for more 3rd person games and I wish you luck but how does floating in zero-g have any effect on getting motion sickness from VR.  Your real body isn't floating in zero-g, you still expect to move and don't which is where the sickness comes from, not the environment of the game itself. War Thunder VR, it's already here. So so good......aaand now I wanna play it again Awesome on console, PC though was... Clunky and underwhelming  It worked great already back in the days !  Maybe have a virtual keyboard they could look down at? Wait a second we've gone full circle  Doesn't matter, with a keyboard you have all your building queues and units one press of a finger away. Putting all that behind tabs you have to point a laser at is always going to be slower. Yep, pretty much everyone on still on the original ren has tried it. It's a fantastic game, but we've all become so accustomed to the little nuances and glitches in the original that we cant give it up But yes. 

This is definitely a high point in my life. I'm so giddy.  IKR?! It baffles me that reading a phrase can trigger visual and auditory memories from a game that you played litterally over 10 years ago. I love lamp? Yeah, I won't ignore the chance that people can learn to use these devices more precisely.  Can confirm.

Introducing my wife to computer games. Unreal engine, real nostalgia. Hope so It was fun and pretty gosh-darn well balanced and the campaign was just so deliciously hammy with JK Simmons and Tim Curry and George Takei all acting like supervillains. Steps to beat AI:

Step 1: Train 2 engineers

Step 2: Build 4 by 4 wall around engineers outside of base

Step 3: ????

Step 4: AI Nukes engineers = PROFIT [Gentlemen, it's a nuclear device. Time is running out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Vu8_EQVXc&p) IFVs fuckign wreck kirovs anyway. You need shitloads of flak against kirovs and it's all just a ploy to distract your opponent while your opponent silently puts out a couple apocalypses. Thats why I play Yuri's Revenge.  There is no faction more troll than one that can clone units that mind control buildings I have the tools!
Ive got the knowledge!  I just realized that the Weeping Angels are Chrono Legionnaires. *I love my boat!* To be fair we have a lot of really good WH games now. Vermintide, Total War, Battlefleet Gothic, and soon Deathwing.

The shitty mobile games came out quickly, the really good games just took longer. Because you know Blizzard will not try this until 20 other companies have shown proven success in the model? In terms of how relatively popular they were? I wouldn't personally say dead, more like in a comatose state

RTSs were as popular as FPSs are now

and most of the people who would play RTSs went to MOBAs PA is great. Forged Alliance was and still is a dope RTS too. Hoping we get another Chris Taylor-esque RTS soon.  I don't see this one getting much recognition, but I loved that game! Actually played it again a few months ago. I had friends that didn't like just how many different "upgrades" there are to research, but I thought it was wonderful. Yuri can only die so many times. DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? I'll just leave this attack helicopter next to all the other helicopters I'm shipping you because why the fuck not? Mine too. I tried to get it running a few months back but I couldn't get it going. So sad. Cities: Copter to go with Cities: Skylines. Lubricating freewheel unit. GTA first person already exist. /r/Arma would like to see you now absolutely not.. 
  \*flash forward to 2025\*  
Tropico Guerilla Warfare to debut to the highest grossing preorder sales ever, EA says the game, which rivals Call of duty, will be the best first person shooter ever.  I got burned into the pre-order and not complaining at all. The park feels so alive and it's such a bliss to play. Some features still.. Need work, but I'm okay with the current state of the game really. I'm not too much against dlc to be honest. If they implement it like Cities! Skylines does it, I say it just enriches your play experience if you chose it to be.  A mistake A walk behind the barn, just like EA does with all their franchises EDIT: 
Due to ea saying "churn out more games, QUICK" No command and conquer past red alert 2 had any time to mature, and were generally rushed out. 

And apparently (thank's to zolambarkudak for the link) C&C 4 was 

>a low key rts planned to be released in asian market slapped a C&C title on it with some cutscenes and released it as the final chapter of the Command and Conquer series. [Greg Black from EA-LA](http://www.gamereplays.org/redalert3/portals.php?show=news&news_id=633194):

  What do you think about Command&Conquer 4? Many people are state C&C 4 is not a game true to the C&C franchise.

  *It's unfair of me to pass judgement on C&C4 as I did not work on it nor have I played the final game. I was however at the studio during much of C&C4's development and have played pre-release builds.* **The important thing to know is that C&C4 was never meant to be a true Tiberium universe canonical game, but rather an experiment in online play.** *It originally started as out an Asian market online-only version of C&C 3. At some point the company executives decided it made the most business sense to add a single player campaign, call it C&C4, and put it in a box. The team of course protested this change in direction but the decision stood. The team did what they could to make a good game given the realities inside EA, but ultimately it was the product of a dysfunctional corporate culture.* I can't speak to EA's general policies regarding this type of content or what their attitude towards it is, but whatever their feelings on the matter they couldn't touch OpenRA because afaik they're not using the copyrighted assets and the engine is entirely reverse engineered. Other projects have done a similar thing in order to port games from one platform to another, such as Heroes of Might and Magic 2 on android. Some third party reverse engineered a lot of the original engine or at least its functionality such that you could copy over your own base game assets on top of the installation in order to get a playable version of the game on android.

EA may be totally cool about it, but OpenRA's continued existence is not necessarily a point in favor of EA as they don't have a say in the matter. Is there any way to play on iPhone or iPad? Is OpenRA's Red Alert like a mix of RA1 and RA2 or it's just RA1? Let's give em an air show! They still managed to fuck up the lan netcode in that :( My hands have splinters!

I played the fuck outta this game They are survived by Petroglyph Games. They made a fusion somewhere between new and old school RTS games called Grey Goo. They even recruited Frank Klepacki to do the music for them again.  
I love it. I mean... It isn't RA2YR, but it's a solid RTS with three diffeent factions, each having a story that interconnects - you only learn the whole thing by completing all three single player campaigns. Everyone says vote with your wallet, stop buying EA games. But the problem is that they won't stop swallowing up franchises. It feels like soon there won't be anything left. *openra.net

Unless you are looking for realty advice.. Love Tiberian Sun, same I found out about online multiplayer for it through Westwood too late. RA2 spent many hours playing ranked. Got pretty high in the rankings >500. Fun as shit. Buddy, TTS is fantastic.  The mod support has basically every tabletop game you could conceive of, both in the Steam Workshop and via NexusMods.  Additionally, the devs started working with some of the game publishers and have official first party DLC for huge awesome games like Zombicide and Scythe.  In the case of Scythe, which I think is like, $125 new, the DLC for it is around $8.  Oh and lastly, only the host needs the DLC or mod (paid or free) for the game you want to play, so if you spend that $8, you can host the game and have that many people in a session.  

I've got a Vive and the VR mode, while not without some hilarious occasional hinkyness, is fucking rad.  Pardon my language.   \> be 2034

\> finally save up enough money for a Warhammer 40k starter set

\> only $500k, what a steal

\> GW is love

\> GW is life I liked that tree tag game. There were so many tricky things both teams could do.

Freeze tag, laser tag... Sheep tag was always just too ridiculous.

One of the many Life simulators where everyone would sprint to the mansion to turn into the drug lord.

What was the game where you'd be in a mansion and someone was invisibly killing people? It had a bunch of secret locations that could only be opened with phrases typed in chat like "open sesame".
 I used to mainline Vuen's D&D Mod and NOTD. So much fun in DnD... LOAP, footmen frenzy and pudge wars were my jam. Really miss those days.  WHO IS THE KILLER? FOOTMAN WARS?

The nostalgia is flowing through me.

Playing who is the killer on ventrilo with my friends late night were some of my favorite gaming experiences. I grew up playing that stuff. All the Starcraft TDs and Warcraft games. I used to play Angel Arena for days I remember waiting around in lobbies praying for someone to host Helms Deep.  I also loved Hero Wars , War of the 12 Kingdoms , Middle Earth and Stronghold. Most of the public games were DotA DBZ tribute was a personal favourite  Probably speaking alone here but my absolute favorite custom game was The Alternate Future, a war/role play game where all 12 players are each a country or a group of countries. I wish the whole wc3 custom games community was still very active because my godd it was fucking legit and fuck now the nostalgia won't go away Run kitty run or riot Gem TD was my shit. Fucking hours. Same with Shopping Maul! I'd always pick the Porno Shop race. LOAP was so fun unless you got a lobby where the police were fascists  TD for days.

WMW was my favorite TD. Eh, I've played Dota 2's custom games and it isn't really the same. A lot of the Dota 2 customs still "feel" like you're playing a slightly modified Dota 2, and a lot of them are really limited by the UI, especially TDs. Some of the better WC3 customs felt like standalone games, as limited as the engine was. There are stories in WoW and they can make an RTS around 'em. That said, I think the diversity of genres benefits blizz better. Still my favorite episode of South park. Ignore WoW

Continue story from WC3  Simple: WC4 takes place in the events of the stuff that's arleady been done in WoW. Y'know all those big NPC factons? Do the blizzard thing and retcon them so that they actually DO something. [deleted] But didn't they dumb down the AI to match? I believe they did. starcraft 64 is canon oh now it poops! atta boy! unleashed ... D'OH! don't eat those... ^If ^someone ^more ^knowledgeable ^than ^me ^finds ^something ^wrong ^about ^anything ^below, ^feel ^free ^to ^let ^me ^know!

You're right to some extent, but remember that you can read a book on a plane despite it moving very fast through the sky. To a lesser extent you can sorta watch a movie while on a long road trip. This is because you're traveling at a (relatively) constant velocity. 

[Vection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusions_of_self-motion#Vection) can occur more easily when there is a noticeable change in acceleration. The accelorometer in your inner ear measures changes in acceleration and jerk, but position and speed are relative so they're hard to measure, and as a result cause less vection.

This is great news for VR developers! We can get away with constant slow and smooth movement if we're very very careful. Lucky's Tale (which I've discovered because of this thread) does this surprisingly well.

What I plan to do in this space-station sim is to have the player on a wall - then push off to another point on a wall in the distance. In this moment I will try to either very slowly accelerate the camera to keep up, or instantly go to a constant velocity to follow the character. The character will float through the air at a lovely constant velocity until they reach the other end where they will abruptly stop. PERFECT. Mario runs and jumps and does crazy flips, but in my game you'll only really be able to go in straight lines at constant rates.

That's the idea anyway ^(famous last words) Get off my lawn missing John Denver references.  It's on Steam. That's a shame, because it really was fantastic on console. Can you still play this online? I play Starcraft 2 currently but would love to play Red Alert again [¿](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew1tJEtdt-E) real = nostalgia, the struggle

unreal = engine, cartoon characters, girlfriend Wait is this really a thing? The **only** reason I can't do 1v7 is the superweapons. If there's a legit bait strategy I will buy the game again T-t-t-time is running out The full introduction cinematic when you load the game. 
Man, when the air horn part began the first time I played, I had chills even as an elementary kid.  God damn the nostalgia is so real rn Ah man when I was a kid, I ripped these songs from youtube and put them on my Sansa e250. The nostalgia :) *Ohh shit*, forgot about those bad asses.. or having the apocalypses guarding the kiroves. Can't forget about terror drones! Clone Vat + Yuri Prime = Multiple team building options

Double Tanya's and Boris'. So good! *sex offender breathing down phone* - desolator ready.  Not too close please! Vermintide is decent but it might as well be a L4D reskin.

Total War was an established franchise, but welcomes.

Is battlefleet gothic actually good? It looked okay just...really shallow. No love for Armageddon or Space Marine?  Keep in mind some of the older games are really good too! Space Marine was Gears of War reskinned, but it was damn stupid fun.

The original Dawn of War (and its expansion) still hold up really well. DoW2 was good too, but I missed the lack of base building. I'm an old Win95 RTS veteran. Yeah it really is a fantastic design, it's the true final game of the Age of Empires series, imo I guess it should work on a virtual machine with windows 98? Best crawling across the battlefield simulator 10/10 would get mowed down again  And it'll have 18 quintillion unique islands to choose from!  Amazing! id really fucking love a multiplayer game where one side plays a dictatorship and the other side does guerillas, with tropico-esque controls on their territories. C&C Died when westwood was bought by EA > "reviewers keep complaining command and conquer is the same every time" That's their reaction to that.

Nope, nowhere near close to that. What really happened is they took a low key rts planned to be released in asian market slapped a C&C title on it with some cutscenes and released it as the final chapter of the Command and Conquer series. 

source: http://www.gamereplays.org/redalert3/portals.php?show=news&news_id=633194 I see. So everything they tried to put as an online pay2win ruined it. Surprise EA. OpenRA is a clean-room implementation of the same engine that powers Dune 2000, Red Alert 1, and Tiberian Dawn.

The devs in OpenRA realised that supporting Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 was actually possible with the same engine - just alter it to support isometric maps and voxel rendering - internally the engine's generally the same (as it was 2.5D internally anyway).

TS/RA2 support has been in the OpenRA engine for over 18 months now, but it's only in dev branches you need to build yourself (so good luck finding anyone to play against) - but it's looking pretty danged polished:

 *special forces here!* I have no idea how you managed to pull a voice from my memory that I didn't even remember I had... CHINA WILL GROW LARGER Witcher is next Just pirate all the EA games, buy others. Problem solved. Titanfall is unspoiled so far. Lol yeah I opened it and was like am I missing out on a joke here. Thank you  Aren't 40k army starters helluva good deal rn?  I'm pretty sure it was just called Murder Mansion. I fucking loved that game! Man, you are making me nostalgic for Brood Wars where most of that shit came from originally... Real life for morons? By moron son of boron  I still regularly play battle net and host Mafia, Pyramid escape, Rural zombie onslaught and others. Game has aged better than anything I've ever seen Let me tell you I was fiending for some Angel Arena not too long ago and I was very pleasantly surprised to find it under the custom games in DotA 2. I don't know exactly how accurate to the original it is, but I sucked at it so that was very familiar The game was pretty old by the time DotA ruined the custom game scene. I say this is a DotA fan. Holy crap so many summers.... That pylon stacking and matrix defenses.... Wow I miss that stuff so much. I miss WMW more than any other game They can, and I would love if they did, but it won't happen. I'd love to see

Warcraft 4 - Vanilla /Burning Crusade / Wrath - Cataclysm
Expansion 1 (since Legion will be one or two behind at that point) - the ongoing arc that is Pandaria/Warlords of Draenor/Legion Boggles my mind that Trey Parker was suicidally disappointed with the finished product the night it aired. Opening movie:

Time is manipulated by Chromie to avoid a yet-untold disaster in future WoW storyline. The devastation is so great that she says fuck the timeline (Days of Future Past anyone?).

Easy peasy. Alternate future after WC3 with a clean slate for story. Leave the big bad "uh oh" ambiguous enough so the story can go wherever. Reboot the whole damn series and stop with the retconned non-sense. found the protoss player That unreal got a bit too real :( Makes sense, really.  They literally are the most dangerous unit in the game. Name virtually any other unit in the game and I can probably eventually obtain it using just one engineer and sufficient gold.

Just like in StarCraft - my highest priority target for using mind control is am SCV or a drone.

The SCV allows me to build medics, making my zealots and templar super strong (can't remember if dragoons can be healed... I know you can spawn brooding them, but you can also do that to siege tanks despite them not being healable).

The drone lets me make zerglings and lurkers. It's mostly meant as a joke but the AI typically does prioritize killing engineers for some reason.  If you actually tried to do this they would probly rush 6 tanks at it, end game when SW are built they will definitely not mind wasting them on those 2 engineers, its pretty hilarious actually

Edit: if you want to actually play a full 8 player AI match play Yuri's revenge. You can actually assign allies in that as well as every teams starting map position. That way you can have 1 or 2 allies who can take the brunt of the damage while you farm ore. Just set the map up so your allies are closer to the enemies than you are. I just tried to play my soundtrack from the special edition that I have in the bottom of my memory box. It's already lost fidelity despite being played only 2-3 times before I ripped it. The muzzle of the pewter Chrono Legionnaire figurine that I got with it was broken when it came out of the box and I was a bit too young to know how to deal with it.

The memories man. Terror drones are the most hilarious way to deal with someone who uses demo trucks. Yeah, imo it was shallow. Captured the feel of giantantic ships battling in the void well, but didn't have enough there to make me want to stay. Vermintide is far more than just a reskin of L4D. Even then, it's a perfectly good game with a variety of weapons, maps and a regular flow of new content.

BFG is good, yes. It's got flaws but I still find it very enjoyable. Space Marine came out before GW carried out a shotgun blast of hurling their IP at literally everyone that asked. It was a goos game, but the MP was flawed due to peer to peer matchmaking, hosting issues and DLC map packs that broke up the community.

Armageddon I've no experience with but I have heard good things. I'm assuming the person I responded to was referring to the dozens of shovelware mobile games that got made after GW threw their IP at anyone who asked, my point being that all the crap money grubby titles got released ASAP but the really good ones have started to be finished off about now. Except Eternal Crusade, oh Eternal Crusade you poor thing... Yes, pls That sounds awesome. 

How would each side play?  Generals was pretty good, and an EA title I definitely disagree. C&C4 was total trash, but EA was in charge for Generals (good), C&C3 (decent), and RA3 (excellent)

I get a lot of disagreement on this, but I think Red Alert 3 is actually the best game in the whole series. It took everything I loved about RA2, balanced the units far better, and made the factions much more distinctive. Oh yeah, and the Russians get attack bears C&C does not exist after Tib Sun for me. You shut your whore mouth I hope your children are born with spider legs.  Get out. Take it back! Take it back right now! How dare you Isn't anything compared to the standard nowadays? I wouldn't know though, I've never bought a starter set, just started on my Tyranids from scratch. It's crazy how Brood Wars and Frozen Throne amped up their map editors so much. I mean it's just an expansion and you'd figure it would only add to the game, not add to *you* adding more to the game. The difference between Reign of Chaos and Frozen Throne is night and day. Blizzard really grabbed a bull by the balls and the whole gaming industry benefitted. I miss Mafia games so much I cannot explain. That and Run kitty run! When I was younger I hated DotA for this reason. lol I didn't play online when I first got the game. By the time I did, servers were mostly for DotA, a few for Jurassic Park, a few for DBZ stuff, and a few for something else whose name I can't remember (you basically moved to a lane and defended your base, was made for 8 players, PvE). Most DotA servers kicked me out immediately when I tried to join, so I barely played it. Why is there no good replacement for td's I have had brainstorming sessions on ways to design WC4 following WoW. Unfortunately, I am not a creative director at Blizzard, but I know if anyone can do it big it's them. [Obligatory](http://i.imgur.com/fFfwy3u.jpg) Using an infestor to neural parasite an SCV is annoying if you want to build a command centre. You have to keep NPing it over and over in order to complete it.  
A nexus you don't have to worry about. Uhhhhh.

This is a terrible strategy. I mean sure, it sounds great, and might work at the casual player level, but you honestly don't get enough resources to tech into an entirely different race just to gain their units. The cost would be high enough that before you reach this point, the full military production would just steamroll you. OMFG that part broke for me too...it never was repaired

legends say that its still in the junk drawer... Never thought of that.. even though I'm usually Iraq with the Desolators.  Why do the Soviets even have attack dogs? Eternal Crusade... YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE.

Sadly another game whose eyes were bigger than its dev budget. I agree, I played the hell out of Generals and loved it. How did they stray so far from that? Generals was a great game, but had nothing to do with C&C apart from the two letters tacked onto its name tbh. Generals was pretty good, but to put an aircraft carrier on the cover and then not have a Navy in the game. Wtf.

Now I have to go play Total Annihilation... No love for Tiberium Sun?! Red alert 3 was fun too but it wasn't promoted well enough and it seemed like they probably spent a majority of their budget on models to play characters For me it would be Generals (excellent), C&C3 (good), and RA3 (mediocre). I didn't like the art style RA3 went with and giving units abilities. The strongest side of RA2 was atmosphere. The apocalypse tank voice over in Yuri's revenge is better than whole RA3. Before RA3, I actually modded Yuri's Revenge so that the Russians had attack Polar Bears and the Americans had Alligators. Except the Polar Bears fired tesla arcs and the Alligators puked out mortar rounds.

Edit: Proof http://orig14.deviantart.net/e877/f/2009/087/1/f/teslabears_and_artilligators_by_ominn.jpg Ugh Red Alert 3 good? Only a couple of units to choose from, too *balanced* it was just rock paper scissors. Too much micro managment of troops, what with them all having secondary powers, they will sit there getting killed by airborne units unless you intervene and deploy their secondary power...

RA2 was the best :D Bear-strikes were the BOMB!

And juggling units as the Japanese School-girl psychic was actually just so satisfying.

It really was a solid game, ~~but Starcraft 2 had essentially herded most of the RTS player-base by then~~. :/ Holy shit, what a curse.  Never saw why Dota got all the love. Hero line wars was the shit, especially the custom variety.  same Same here lol. Maybe Enfos or Fuzas? Those maps were the shit. You don't get that sweet +200 supply like you did in Brood War though :) Oh, I'm thinking of Brood War and the red Darchons.   Desolators are fun. Just spam them enough and even tanks will wear down. Нет. Русский have bears Woof Remember when they were going to make a version of Generals using the Frostbite engine? And then it was F2P...and then it was cancelled. I think. I don't even know anymore. Money grab, EA failed to realize that the majority of players that loved the C&C franchise were generally those that loved the single player. Unfortunately, the current generation of games tends to be multi-player focused because that's what sells to the biggest audience. They also failed to realize with C&C4 that if they try to compete in the RTS multiplayer market, they're going to come up against Starcraft2, Sins of a Solar Empire, and other game franchises that have pretty well been defined by their multi-player for 10+ years, which means those games are ALWAYS going to be more popular from a multi-player perspective.

I'm not going to lie and say that EA didn't do a good job on the early C&C titles after they purchased Westwood, because RA2, C&C3 and Generals were not bad games. But after C&C4 and canceling Tiberium and almost making Generals2 free to play multi-player and pay to play single player (before thankfully canceling it), I just couldn't stand them anymore, and swore that I would never buy anything with the EA label on it again. Generals was actually amazing. I would play multiplayer for hours with a good group of people and we would all agree on a 15 minute armistice just so we could have huge wars. Suicide bikers were the way to go! I will make the sacrifice! Only Starcraft comes close to it. RA3 came out almost two years before SC2. Enfos is love. I also miss X hero siege Spammed enough and the computer I use would nearly freeze while looking over them.. then be fine if I looked else where on the map. Good times..
 It got as far as an [Alpha Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtl2Q_tUDDQ) that looked as if the core of the game was at least working (I'm assuming the video is genuine as it looks a lot higher resolution than the prior iterations of generals).

Seemed to fall off the radar after it was 'shelved' in 2013... probably at least in part because the big selling point was always single player and the focus seems to be very MMO or mobile these days. TBH with the mess that was C&C 4, I'm not sure EA even knows now. 

FWIW, I would love a graphically updated version of the original couple C&C and Red Alert games. I have them on my laptop, but tbh the low resolution of the models vs modern games spoils the fun a bit for me. I would keep the videos exactly the same though (even if resolution was an issue, just find a way to make the presentation hide this) & Red Alert is still my favourite of the lot. AK-47s for everybody!!!! Thank you for the shoes :) I was almost concerned that either you or your friend had only one colored shirt, until the last picture. *They set out to complete every Lego game they could. But in the end, the most important thing they completed...was each other.*

*Coming this fall:*

*100% in Love* I always start out trying to 100% the games and I'm currently trying to do that for Lego Batman 3 but I always get bored and just give up. The only one I have actually fully completed is Lego City Undercover on the Wii U. It's kinda sad that only the Lego games are capable of having a decent split screen multiplayer anymore

Thinking about it, apart from Nintendo games, i cant even name 2 fun and worthwhile split screen coop games I wish I had a buddy as obsessed with getting 100% and achievements done as I was.

Them: "DUDE, JUST PLAY THE DAMN GAME!"
Me: "WHAT'S THE POINT, IF YOU AREN'T GONNA DO IT RIGHT?!" You should do Lego Marvel Superheroes next!

It's open world which is a ton of fun. No Indiana Jones 2/10   
But siriously, great job! :D (and that Jack Spparrow cosplay <3) Nerds Which one was the most fun? I'm kind of spoiled now. One guy was dressed up in one of the pictures. I think you guys need to make that a thing with future Lego games. Me and my brother used to do this, until he got so obsessed with his girlfriend that he never comes home.

It's sad. Haha that's some real dedication.  You guys should pose for one of these pictures shirtless or nude!  That would be hilarious I bet you can't 100% Lego Rock Band.  **#relationshipgoals** Me and my girlfriend so the same thing!

so far

Lego LOTR

Lego The Hobbit

Lego Marvel Avengers

Lego Jurrasic park/World

Still going strong! Whoever that bookcase belongs to: You have good taste in books! Do I see Robert Jordan WOT on the bookshelf?  If so..  Great taste in books..  👍 The fact that buddy on the right is holding a glass of water up in the 4th pic makes it my favorite by far. My god I'm so fucking lonely... you guys should stream it or something lol This is very impressive. 

How are you still friends? Good luck on Lego Rockband! I love how in one pic his dressed up as Jack Sparrow Lego Dimensions?  Slackers! Where's Lego Star Wars III, Lego Marvel Super Heroes, Lego Marvel Avengers, Lego Indiana Jones 1 & 2 and Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens? Huh? HUH??

Kidding aside, I have every Lego game made, except for The Force Awakens, in my household due to my kids. They are spread across Wii, 3DS and Xbox 360. The only one I came close to 100% was LotR, which I think is sitting at 87%. I only got that far because it was the first one I played with actual voices in it and it was fun to walk from the Shire to Mount Doom in a few minutes.

 Is that the Night Angel trilogy on the bookshelf right above the TV? Man, I remember reading those years ago. You know I can tell that one series of books on the shelf is The Wheel of Time because of book 9 Winter's Heart My 6 year old and 4 year old did as well.  What about the marvel Lego games?

Oh and Indiana jones I just to 100% on LEGO Avengers, I'm glad I'm not the only way too old to be playing this game adult that does this. "buddy" How do you guys find the time? I can barely get through a level of any Lego game before I have to go back to doing boring old people stuff.  Damn guys. Save some pussy for the rest of us!  I'm interested in those shelves behind one of the TVs. They look like fantasy novels?

Might warrant a r/shelfporn post, frankly.  How are all those lego games? Thinking they might be a good way to get my gf into games with those ones. She loves Lord of the Rings so prob start with those ones. Does your 100% include all trophies? I was only 1 trophy off complete 100% on Lego LOTR, simply because I didn't have a friend to play with :( No LEGO City Undercover?

Pfft. The games are designed for kids so they're very easy to complete 100 percent. Step up your game, boys. What about LEGO Indiana Jones? Alright boys and girls, pack it up. We will resume this session on the front page.  Dude on the right in first photo (and onward) looks like a nicer Bradley Cooper.  Any chance we could get a pic of that bookshelf? It looks pretty awesome! Idc what anybody says, that's true friendship. You guys going to try Lego Dimensions? That is an expensive challenge. Lego Indiana Jones was my favorite one of these games and you didn't play it.  Shame. What about LEGO: Indiana Jones? I actually really, really enjoyed playing through some of the Xbox Lego games. The nostalgia level is high  Relationship goals.  impressive. i play these games with my kids , have yet to get past like 40% I'm actually amazed at how fast and now well these games are made. My son and I enjoy playing them together and it's helping him with his problem solving skills....at least I'd like to believe that it is lol  I'm pretty sure you're both of those guys. Working on The Force Awakens then? Diggin the wheel of time collection above the tv Try lego racing. Youll never get 100 TIL that forever equals 49 hours, 53 minutes, 34.79 seconds. You guys put more effort into LEGO games than I put into my entire life. Nicely done! LEGO games are lots of fun!  but have you gotten 100% in Lego Island? I'm now engaged to the woman who loves to do this with me. So far we've only done the lotr and Harry potter's but I'm trying to get her into star wars. Is one of you Will Friedle? Cuz I think one of you is Will Friedle! These guys fuck. Katie Nolan is sitting somewhere seething with jealousy. No Rockraiders? the one guy looks like zach galifinakis and dave navarro had a kid I'm pretty sure I have every one of those books. My fiancée and I also like to fully complete the LEGO games. The Star Wars games, Hobbit, LOTR, Avengers. So much fun :-) Doubt op would ever see this all things considered but you have amazing taste in books, we would be best friends.  What about the Lego Indiana Jones games? Those were the ones I used to play the most Me and my brother did 100% in Indiana Jones 1 and 2, star wars the complete saga, and  Batman 1. We did them on the Wii so we only played them in 2009-10. Lego Batman ON THE PSP IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE, BECAUSE OF THE SLIDE.   Each time you try, you gotta go ALL the way back, too. Try it, OP... Welcome to 99.9% hell.  Reddit is a diverse community. The grind on Star wars Complete Saga was real. 

But damn you two must really have had messed up childhoods to enjoy putting yourself through that pain  And not a single vagina was harmed during this process. Well done guyz!  Hitchhiking - You're doing it wrong.  No Lego island huh? Scrubs. You motherfuckers need to pick a side and fucking stay there! 

Do it over.  R.I.P couch co-ops you've got lego or little big planet now But what about lego indiana jones 2? Me and my wife used to do this. Well, she cared, I just wanted to progress. I really miss her.  Lego The Hobbit is a pain to 100%, good for you guys. Try that shit with Lego Dimensions. Star Wars... The nostalgia. Are you guys gay?  Meaning in a relationship or cohabitate?  How did you get all this done in a reasonable amount of time together?

If you both work full time and live separately, that scratches out the mornings.  You could play a few hours in the evenings together if you live close and ate dinners together.  Or did you guys do this by playing weekend only? SO AWESOME. My boyfriend and I are working on all the games too! Our absolute favorite is The Hobbit. The glitches made it hilarious, and the techno song? Just wow. Also the fact that they just ditched the last game. XD Sorry if you've been asked this before but I'm dying to know now, what is each of you guys' favorite Lego games?  You are a pair of manchildren...

I love you. Awesome! I got a 100% on Harry Potter: Years 1-4 and now I'm working on getting a 100% on Harry Potter: Years 5-7! Already finished the storyline, now gotta complete it all :) 
and I helped my boyfriend achieving a 100% on Lego: Lord of the Rings. I absolutely love the Lego games :3 How the fuck are you still friends after 100%ing even one of those games? After all of them you must have each tried to kill the other at least once by now.  How single are you?
 There are 11 pictures. I only looked at 10 of them. I achieved 90.9% and I'm perfectly happy with that. This is how you become an alpha tester. Send these two over all future Lego games before they are released to get their approval. Win/win for all.  Man I wish I had a real friend. One that is actually into shit I am. You guys switched positions 

[Triggered] I hope someone from Telltale sees this post. You guys should get your own easter egg characters in the next Lego game! MOM GET THE CAMERA! The ultimate challenge: Lego Dimensions. Which will it drain first: your spirit, or your wallet? Because it's currently getting some good shots on the latter for me. Thank God they're doing a story pack for the Ghostbusters reboot, because I know I'll at least stay away from that. Title should be my buddy and I never get laid and here's why.  I have 100% on 4 of them I think! Maybe I need to give batman another try... I enjoy playing the LEGO games myself, I think I've only 100% 2 of their games. LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, and LEGO Star Wars Ep. 1-3 (the original LEGO Star Wars game) You guys are amazing! And you have a great friendship <3 I assume you're working on The Force Awakens? What would you say are the best and worst Lego games you've played. I used to do this with my little brother, I miss those days, we beat all the lego star wars games, the indian jones's, and the batman games.  I can see the Night Angel Trilogy books on your shelf. 

Fucking love those books. I am not the only one? Thank god! And we're the game grumps!  I got you guys beat on Lego Star Wars. Me and my little brother played it together when were were 9 or 10, and we had it 100% along with having the max amount of studs, 8 billion. And which one was the best? How's your progress on Lego Dimensions? :) Which one is your favorite? My son and I have been having fun playing through them. I love these damn games. I'm currently stuck on Indiana Jones 2, so I started working on Batman 3. I like my black shirts and have a large collection, some in black, some in a slightly darker black. I must be like OP because I'm the kind of person who didn't even notice what they were wearing besides the Jack Sparrow costume Maybe to the laymen! Ya got: Obsidian, Onyx, Midnight, Lost Soul, Rolling Blackout, Sleeping Panther, and Void by Armani. This is why I love reddit. I never notice these things.  I can't quit you! ...because the game completely froze and I have to reboot the Playstation Broke-back, lego.

[Movie Poster](http://imgur.com/a/n9owc) Marvel was the only one I got 100% on. Tried with the Lego Movie game but got frustrated with the achievement for getting a perfect score on the "Everything is Awesome" rhythm game I've 100%ed a bunch of them and Lego City Undercover is by far the most fun to do. It's my favourite Lego game by miles. Lego Batman 3 is one of the worst due to all the individual planets you have to do in the hub world.  I luuuv Lego City! So much fun.  Dude good on you for 100% Lego City. That's the only one I gave up on. Lego City: Undercover is a great reason to own a WiiU. It's one it the few legitimately funny games I've played. Well they weren't actualy SPLIT-screen until a few years ago, they would stop you from leaving frame in the older ones and now it's an organic split screen. Divinity!  Rocket League! If you haven't played it, you're missing out! portal? Me and my gf at the time played through the *Army of Two* games.  Pretty fun couch co-op. Haven't read the comments below but;

Rocket League - Extremely fun game 1v1 or playing together as as team.

Resident Evil 5 - Great co-op game.

Call of Duty - I haven't played COD since MW3 but you can't deny it's a fun to play against a friend. 

FIFA 16 - In European countries pretty much everyone who has a console has FIFA, great 1v1. In North America I imagine a lot of people have fun playing each other on NHL or Madden. 

Minecraft - When it came out it was brilliant to work together co-op split screen.

Star Wars Battlefront - Not everyone's cup of tea but this is still one of my go to games if one of my friends comes around to play co-op.

Borderlands - Twice the fun to play with a friend co-op split screen. Risk of Rain

Don't Starve Together (may not be couch co-op, can't remember)

Death Spank

Castle Crashers*

Battleblock Theater

Crypt of the Necrodancer

That's just games I found after making a pass-through of *my* Steam Library. 

Not strictly 2 player, but fun to trade turns with a friend in order to ~~help~~ ~~make you look like a fool~~ have fun:

Papers, Please

Hotline Miami

FTL

\* are my favorites. I agree to an extent. It has been hard to find a couch co-op game that both my wife and I enjoy. That said, while it's not split screen, BroForce was a pleasant surprise when I finally gave it a try and later convinced her to try it. If you haven't already, you might check it out. This is to your point but just wanted to shout out how great super mario  3d world coop is There are more than you think. Some I come to think of:
All trine games, rocketleague, most resident evil games, borderlands, dungeon defenders, Forced and a crap ton of indie games. And those are all for pc btw. I have beef with Lego hobbit. It doesn't let me do top/bottom split or me and my wife could enjoy this a lot more.  Gears of War Achievements are nice, because they direct me towards a goal. They incentivize playing the game differently than I have done so far.





With that being said, many games make 100%-ing a game as fun as rubbing your dick against a grindstone. Obligatory: http://i.imgur.com/SGqQOId.png
 Was playing mario with a bud of mine and he kept stopping and running back.  I asked what was up and he looked me in the eyes and said "we need to get every single coin."

I legit almost cried. Someone who gets me. I have a list of indie games that I keep downloaded and over time I work at getting a few achievements here and there.  I only delete them once they're at 100% since they usually take up less than 1GB of space on my hard drive.  My list of 100% games is small but my list of 80%+ games is huge and eventually I'll get them to 100%.

Why?  Cuz.  I like indie games.  I had the world high score in an indie game for a while.  Made me feel like I almost accomplished something worthwhile.

Almost. You should should have married my wife instead of me... She's hot too. This is how I get with my mom. She just runs through the game and I'm being dragged along while trying to collect all the things and I get frustrated and yell at her to stop and she's like it's just a game chill the hell out she I'm like I want the shiny stuffs and she just runs off again and the cycle repeats until I rage quit. My hubby is a big gamer, has a gamer score of over 300k. He has a small group of buddies that is just as big into as he is. They have a couple "gaming" parties each year where they come to our house, set up like 6 tvs and pop achievements all weekend long. Playing video games, drinking, and eating pizza. (And I go away, lol)

This past weekend they all came over. They got another one of the guys over 300k during their session! And, they went to Pax too! 

It's pretty cool that he has this group that's just as interested in it as he is!  Yes! And the sheer variety of characters is awesome. They all have lots of characters but anecdotally I don't think there's usually as much variety of powers like in Harry Potter where mostly everybody does the same thing except a few people can do dark magic and a few people have pets etc. With marvel superheroes, some people can fly, some people can swing from web, some people have magnetic powers, some people can shrink down, some people can switch forms, etc.  The only game I've ever 100%  Reason being it was a damn fun game. I'm convinced that getting 100% in that game is impossible.  Like I really think there's a glitch that shows you as having 99.5% completion even after you've completed all the campaigns, saved all the Stans, found all the mini-models, done all the Side-missions, gone into all the doors, found all the gold bricks, unlocked all the characters... But Avengers will kill you (particularly if you thought Star Wars Complete Saga took a long time). We're about halfway through the first one right now :) Ha, I think if they can do all of these, they can do the first Indiana Jones game. That's the only one I was ever able to 100%! Lego Indiana Jones 2 was hands down the best Lego game ever.  Hi 100% Lego buddy! How did you guys decide who gets the karma? Harry Potter 2 or Lord of the Rings I agree with them about HP but a great one they didn't do is Marvel Superheroes. It's open world with a massive variety of characters and it's a ton of fun.  I think it depends on what your interests are.  I play through these with my wife sometimes.  She likes Harry Potter, so she really enjoyed those games, while they were just alright for me.  I'm a HUGE Jurassic Park fan (the original movie is my all time favorite film) so I was understandably losing my shit in that game. Lego Avengers would be great. Please do Black Widow *Scroll scroll scroll* Wait...was that a pirate? It's not like I just have costumes lying around. Well he's probably at 82% vagina, so he's gotta keep going back.  I'm sure he still loves you. Maybe one day he'll balance his time better so he can find time for you and his girlfriend Yeah!! and have your dick in your hand! that would be funny!! its a joke!! hilarious!!  They're only 1 off enough pictures for a saucy charity calendar:

Perfectionists Uncovered

All proceeds go to one of those video game charities. r/gamersgonewild Right? That 100% solo on the final countdown is ridiculous. Holy shit I remember playing that. The thing that set it apart from other rock band games was that you could upgrade your studio and vehicles n stuff, it was pretty awesome.  But did you beat Portal 2 together? The bookcase itself is exquisite I know, right? I recognized a lot but not others. I really want to know the full contents of that bookshelf! But it's next to Sword of Truth series... These sessions are usually fueled by alcohol, but we happened to beat that one during our January white month. It's vodka. I have nobody of my own. I'm so lonely... Would watch I believe they are brothers now  Yes it is doesn't have to be expensive, you can hire heroes (you pay with studs) for most everything. and there is a glitch that lets you hire heroes and then keep them indefinitely during your gaming session, even allowing you to travel them between worlds. 

it would become more of a grind I suppose. Do you currently own any Tactleneck shirts.  Any in really really really dark grey? Reminds me of the black visor in Halo Reach:  
  
>You can have it in any color you want... as long as it's black. Someone find the parks and rec scene. Pretty sure one is dark navy blue.  Reminds me of [this fantastic explanation on the color black from Aziz](https://youtu.be/fT5Gpp4W1cA) Batman? Is that you? I did not notice the jack sparrow costume until you pointed it out so it can always be worse I guess.  Are you guys still working on Lego Indiana Jones? "You ever get the feelin'... i don't know, er... when you're in town and someone looks at you all suspicious, like he knew? And then you go out on the pavement and everyone looks like they know too?"

"They'll never understand our lego or why we do what we do. It's just, it's what we *are*." Broke-brick

FTFY In 1997, rodeo cowboy /u/therippa and his buddy independently came across Lego Island. Both felt essentially alone in the world, however this game lit up something deep inside them. 

Many years later the two would meet at a brick convention and accidentally brush each others hand with both reaching for the same lego set. therippa would look up and see in this man's eyes the same burning passion for lego that he himself had, and he knew, instantly that this man would become his buddy. 

Turns out they both lived relatively close to each other, frequented the same places, and yet had never crossed paths. Initially encouraged by the women in their lives, to take their mind off the pressures of becoming the greatest rodeo cowboy alive and running a ranch respectively, the two spent more and more time together. At the beginning this manifested as time spent at the bar, debating the merits of their favourite Lego adventures. Eventually, they would go to a beer festival and casting a glance at each other, nodded. No need for words. They both knew what needed to be done. They proceeded to try all the different ales and lagers on offer. Staggering, they reached #20 and with a steely look in their eyes quaffed their pint of "Yellow Snow". 

As his buddy collapsed onto the ground, therippa stared at his back and knew. He had always known, but this confirmed it. This man was a kindred spirit. Someone who would not be satisfied until they had got to the end while trying out everything there was to offer - a bona fide completionist! 

After the inevitable hangover, therippa would invite his buddy over, who saw that Lego Star Wars was up, and jumped over the sofa to grab a controller. Much time passed, work was postponed, beards grew, bellies expanded, hair grayed, women were ignored, places were swapped. All that mattered was that slowly increasing percentage. Their love of lego was tested; the only respite was the small victory thumbs picture that came with the completion of each game. The 100% bringing an all too brief buzz. The hunger, the need to finish the next game, that could never be fully suppressed for long. And so they would start again, refilling the cooler, brushing off the chettos dust and booting up the next lego adventure. 

As they were on their last game, on a cold summer night, the boiler broke down, taking the heating with it. Quite tipsy, rather than finish for the night, they made a blanket fort ontop of the sofa and continued their quest. Objects were smashed, bricks were collected, characters were unlocked, and then therippa made a drunken pass at his buddy under the duvets. It was eventually reciprocated. 
Over the next several days, the two increasingly gave in to their attraction to one another. Suddenly it wasn't all about the game anymore. 

Almost by accident, therippa would stumble upon the final brick in their very last game. 

**100%** 

It was all they could see on the screen. Without saying a word, the two buddies let the controllers fall onto their laps, and were suddenly hit by silence. It enveloped them, rooting them to their seats, as they struggled to comprehend what they had achieved. After what felt like a year but was probably just a minute, therippa turned his head to his buddy and saw that he too was struggling to hold back the tears. They both knew that summer had ended.  Broke-foot lego Broke block mountain Broke-Heel, if you're really talking about LEGO.  I noticed it  this is hilarious! "Hehe that's a funny achievement"

"Haha yeah, heh"

"..."

"..." [removed] /u/DrWankalot has some great ones That would be u/Your_Post_As_A_Movie and I'm a fan as well but they sadly don't do requests. Don't Lego my heart Lego my eggo Instead of taking his fiancee to the Rush show with them, he takes her to PAX. More like they got killer HAAAAAAAAANNNNNNDDDD EEEEEEEYYYYYEEEEE coordination! The damn brown plank tight rope walk things in LEGO LOTR were the hardest part of the game, this one block in mordor took me forever and made me so angry. Marvel really annoyed me with the Flying stuff you had to do for the gold bricks. The control scheme was so twitchy it was rage inducing. You can get 100% without getting all the achievements. Because I, too, gave up on those achievements, but still got 100%.  
  
It wouldn't be so bad if you could just retry, but you have to play through the whole level first, every time you try. I did exactly the same. If you miss it even slightly you have to start the whole level over.  I thought Lego Batman 3 was the worst but to tell you the truth, I thought 100%'ng the most recent Lego Avengers game was worse.

 That game is currently surprising me. Glad its a Nintendo select now, Got it for $11 with GCU and a coupon. > organic split screen

Lego Arrow: The Felicity Stories is out now!? Ugh, and that's when my friend and I stopped playing them. I recognize it was kinda necessary for them to continue to advance their level design but it really killed the fun for us. > organic split screen. 

Oooh! Organic... I didn't even know they had that until now. I've been getting factory farmed split screen until now.  On the WiiU these games are amazing. Each person gets their own screen. 1 on the TV and 1 on the handheld. Yeah I was surprised how efficient the split screen was in D:OS! Makes it a perfect game for the Steam Link.  Rocket League is fun by itself.

Rocket League is more fun online with friends.

Rocket League IS FUCKING GREAT at home with friends and a few beers. Rocket League was $15 and I play it more than any other xbox game I own It also supports split screen up to 4 players on the PC too.  Lest we forget Borderlands. 

EDIT: removed erroneous words thanks to /u/FrankFeTched  That was last generation Nothin' quite like fist-bumping your murder buddy after the slaughter  I have some family friends from Italy. A few years ago they were visiting my family here in New Zealand. There was a bit of a language barrier and an age barrier between me (about 18) and the friends' kids (about 10). So I chucked FIFA (world cup edition) into the Xbox 360 and the evening was saved. Most of those are not splitscreen (they are same screen). And Risk of Rain is unplayable in local coop. Hotline Miami is two player? But the majority of those are indie games.   Indies 4 life Secondind Broforce, me and three other friends played through the entire game on the second hardest diffculty together (couldnt unlock the hardest difficulty because you need to finish Ironbro mode for that and that's singleplayer. RIP) Too true.

Ones that motivate you improve the game, but there are a lot that are a grind.

Get S-Ranks on missions, yeah, okay.  
Get 10,000,000,000 gold in a game where the OPTIMUM gold gain leaves you grinding the same mob repeatedly for HOURS after getting EVERY other achievement? not so much. [deleted] I really want to 100% Dark Souls 3, but the multiplayer achievements are such a grind. They're pretty much the only part I have left to do and I can't get motivated to sit through it.  LOOKING AT YOU JC2, with your damn bug that makes you get stuck on 99,97 or something like that. argh So true. Thinking of it, after completing most of the achievements and unlocks in a game, I usually abandoned it. Or clitoris* we can't forget female gamers :) Looking at you, kingdom hearts 1.5 Me and my best friend.  Always brags about how quickly he beat the game, or how much farther he is than me, like it's going to earn my respect or something. I always try to get all the bananas in DKC, *including* the ones hidden in the ground. I'm  worried about posting more in this thread though because I think I'll just start listing all the games I've done "perfect" runs for. Every coin? Wow that's intense, they don't even tell you how many there are. ...But then why weren't *you* collecting the coins?!

*Leers suspiciously* This made me tear up... And...and you just throw this in my face...*cries softly* Fuckin' gamer moms... haha. But seriously your mom sounds cool af anyways. This sounds like a dream. Awesome. It's got the most powers out of any Lego game I've played, I think.

It does a really nice job of that though, design-wise: The abilities ultimately fall into just so many basic categories (e.g. flight, freezing stuff, electricity) that you can remember them all, but there's then still a lot of variety in how exactly they're realised. Like, a heating/cutting beam could come from Cyclops' eyes or Iron Man's wrist laser; you can smash walls down with big characters like Hulk, or with Thor's hammer.  
That way almost every character is useful in some way, and you don't get bogged down in a ton of *slightly* different or odd single-use abilities. Swing from a web? No way. I've never heard of a superhero who does that. All vehicles too. I was on 99.9% for a couple days and eventually found some dude who wanted to sell me a boat for some studs... I was so relieved when the platinum trophy popped up.  Some of those races are *damn* hard.
 I 100% Lego Marvel Super Heroes with my friend, but it took us a whole month last summer. We haven't finished Lego Avengers yet. But it really is doable! I used the Xbox achievements as a nice roadmap for what I still had to do :)

Edit- I did get stuck at 99.9% myself, I remember. But please trust me when I say there will be just one little thing you've missed! Good for you. That was my first LEGO game therefore one of my favourites :) I made it to something like 99.5 in Lego Indiana Jones 1. Some fucking chest got bugged and I couldn't find it no matter what. The second one is probably the only Lego game I've ever not liked. It's just levels from KotCS and bonus levels from the first three. Not great. Dude, good luck. There's the one achievement to get every single block in the bonus level and it's almost impossible. I remember being frustrated as fuck trying to find the last one.  Then you have the second one to do, Lego Marvel Superheroes, Lego Avengers, Lego Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and the upcoming Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens Ah that's the only lego game I 100%'ed as well! IIRC when you completed it coins started raining from the sky indiana jones 2 has been the only one that i could not do 100% on.  i'm not even sure i finished story mode. Only game I've ever gotten 100% achievements on. Although FO4 I'm very close. now kiss [This](http://i.imgur.com/yRyOKNm.jpg) would have been a lot easier with a buddy. He told me after he posted. I personally loved Marvel Superheroes the most. You should give it a try. The Indiana Jones collection is good too. 

I originally played HP1 on Wii and there was a glitch that made it so you couldn't enter the Gryffindor common room after a certain point in the story so I was stuck at ~99% cause I missed something. It was the most infuriated I've ever been at a game. Eventually I ended up getting it during a Steam summer sale and finishing it.  LOTR has the best open world by far. Obviously. It's fucking Middle Earth. And it has music from the movies.

For me, Batman 2 is probably a close second. Lego Gotham is a really fun city to explore, and it's more fun to fly around the city as Superman or run as Flash than it is to jog like Frodo. Is that why you did Harry Potter 2 a second time? If you played together did you get the harry potter 1 bug where the potion room bugs and you never get the polyjuice potion? Happens If you play it on coop and was one of the few legos we had left... now the dream is dead cause screw doing that all again. Loved Harry Potter 2. Me and my wife spent a bunch of time getting 100% in it too and had a freaking blast.  Yeah those two are the best. My wife and I have 100% both multiple times - I think 4 for Harry Potter and 3 for LOTR. Good games to chill out and mess around in.  Why does everything gotta be black with you? My ex and I used to do this. I think we may have even 100% completed a few more than OP. I now no longer play Lego games and miss her terribly 🙁  w-what does being at 100% vagina mean? or you could like...put each other's dicks in your mouths. classic shit right there.  Haha that's amusing. Now make your thing touch his thing and stare at me while you're doing it. As a hilarious joke, obviously. Yea!!! And turn around a little so I can see your assholes! Yeah hilarious.... Hahahhahahah... that link will stay blue. i imagine its all fat sweaty guys pooping on NES controllers. Agreed. They really increased the Plat difficulty for every game after RB 2, hurts my ego :/ That solo is the only thing I had left in the entire game.  They want to continue dating so no... Of course!

We almost broke up 12 times  Only clear alcohol in January... I see, gets you through the Christmas blues. Very smart. no drinking january ? Pint of vodka, lots of ice.  You still need actual characters to unlock each world and all the levels.  Yes, also an Omicron Spymaster and a neat switchblade You see, ordinary shops sell what look like black shirts, but if you look closely, you'll see that they're very, very, very, very, very, very, very dark blue. They were referencing Henry Ford, when he said in jest:

>> Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.

Edited: to not sound like a douche. this is sad I bet you think this is black, Jerry?

*Aziz laugh* I thought it was an Archer reference.  We had both played it before, so we concentrated on other games, but we are almost done Indiana Jones. Broke-prick [Gone wrong] Brick-back 
FTFY Guys - BRICK BACK MOUNTAIN. FTF(both of)Y.  Lego Island was the shit I thought I was in r/writingprompts for a minute Still a better love story than Twilight. Guy posts picture of his achievement online, ends up with gay fan fiction about him and his buddy. I don't know what I expected. Hot ;-) excellent If spaced properly for a screenplay this would get bought I was a camp counselor and they had a talent show me and my co-counselor convinced our camper to stomp on legos as his talent. He didnt even cry :')


P.S. I have the video of it not sure if I can share it though. [https://i.imgur.com/wbiwZ35.gif](https://i.imgur.com/wbiwZ35.gif) "Wanna play legos?"

"No foolin'? Can we 100%?"

"Of course we will! Is there any other way?!"

"Aw, yes!" Build a hundred bridges and no one calls you a bridge-builder. But fuck ONE goat... > for some reason. 

It actually tells you if you click the tag, it will take you to the comment where you originally tagged them. I see you all the time because I have you tagged as the guy that keeps forgetting that he's got someone tagged as "goat fucker" I love his stuff.. I feel like one day he'll choose one of my images and that's when I'll know I've made it. I'll never Lego! y u make me think of eleven like that? I literally shouted obscenities at my screen over that on I got so pissed, cuz it's just poorly designed. There's invisible walls that protrude up from the sides of he planks, so you can't jump on them from certain directions... And then they were placed in the gameworld sideways so you're screwed just to bunny hop between them. There's one block near the bonus level entrance that's so fuggin' difficult to get because of the camera angle on top of the fact that you have to rope-swing to it.  marvel races are the ENEMY!

thankfully the dimensions ones are a bit better but damn they're horrible They kinda improved the flying mechanics in Lego Avengers, but they're still annoying AF.

What's weird is if you wanna fuck around in the sandbox the flying mechanics are generally great. But the second you need to do the kind of precision flying needed to complete those stupid races, the game freaks the fuck out! You can actually retry. If you walk back up to the speaker/boombox thing that is playing it on top of the building you can re do the dance. I kicked myself when I found this out as I played that level over 10 times. just finished Lego Avengers. It seens like it is more important to follow the movie script than to give any control or fun to the game players. And, lets just take the best part Lego marvel super heroes, the open city of Manhattan, and just copy and paste it into this game a new game.   /r/wiiu always recommends it, no matter how old you are, the game is just fun. Tom. C'mon [Well...](http://imgur.com/iakHazz) Too soon. :( STAHP


RUNNING



THAT



WAY Letting your friend walk more than 20 feet away killed it for you? > Rocket League IS FUCKING GREAT at home with friends and a few beers.

Been thinking about picking up this game for a while. I think you just sold me on it. You know those games that make you rage at your retarded teammates? I tried Rocket League: I was the retard and it was even more frustrating. Yup, $20 CAD, and have 850 hours now. Can't put it down. same here.  I played it last night for like 90 minutes.  I meant to play like 2 games..... It's just "Lest we forget Borderlands", but I agree with you. Coop was done so well it made the game so much more fun, and that is rare these days.  I want to love borderlands. It feels like a game I SHOULD love. But I just don't. =(

It makes me sad. TIL I stopped gaming last generation :-( *cough* Battleborn is basically borderlands :D What makes Risk of Rain unplayable in local co-op?

I've done it before without issues, unless there's a glitch very far in. Fair enough, but Risk of Rain is absolutely shared/split screen. Not that I'm aware of. The difference between enjoyment and grind is often a fine, if not completely invisible, line. It involves careful planning from the start, which most game designers fail to envision. Killed an enemy while swinging from a rope with your boomerang on the return arc while over water in multiplayer with two players on your friends list swimming in the water on the first day of September. : 10 G lego games are about finding everything and then its 100% Achievements/Trophies that require multiplayer are complete bullshit. Darkmoon blade only took me 6 hours of silver knight farming, it was actually the watchdogs of farron that was way worse for me. 2 days of killing the same 3 ghru's over and over and over. Bloodborne was way more satisfying to 100% imho.  What a great game though.  Especially Chain of Memories... It's OK bud.  This is a safe space for us.  Let me tell you about kirby... Sorry. Just saying. Yeah, it is true there's a fair amount of overlap but it's cool how within that you get to choose what combination of powers you want. 

Like, say you need to fly, you get to decide, do I want to have Silver Surfer's cosmic powers of Iron Man's laser cutter or Thor's hammer? And even within that, you have different versions of, for instance, Iron Man's suit with different powers.  GOAT lego game Yeah, Indiana Jones 2 was the best.  Same! It's my all time favorite Lego game, just because it has so much character. :) That's the opposite of my problem I have 154 chests out of 150 because of a bug Goddamn, same here, brother and I searched for ages for that last tiny bit but alas, we never found it. Then my little brothers took the torch and decided to accidentally delete the profile and it still keeps me up at night.  Mwah! Now kith I've never even tried playing it alone.  68 hours...damn! +1 for Lego Marvel Superheroes.
Really had fun playing that game. I also really liked how you had to collect the silver bricks to cash them in for Mithril items to return them to characters in the world. It gave collecting those bricks a purpose and you also had to think wisely about which Mithril items you wanted to cash your bricks in on. There are two Harry Potter games We never got that bug.  Closest we got was at the very end of Star Wars (after putting in 49 hours), we had a glitch where we tried to get a stormtrooper hat on chewbacca, but the door scanner wouldn't recognize and open it.  I can't remember what we had to do to fix it, but I was sure we were going to be stuck at 99.9% Haha brojob choo choo Aww you got my hopes up... Naw, it's not as bad as one would think The key to dating is letting your boyfriend try Portal 2 with you. Can confirm - one of the last games the ex an I played was Portal 2... hahaha nearly every level. It's meant to be then! Congrats! "Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets."

-Ron Swanson I've actually done this the past 3 years, it's a refreshing way to start each new year. Is there a story behind how you got said switchblade?  https://i.imgur.com/XgbLt4T.gif I'm now convinced you used to have a multicolored wardrobe until you started watching Archer and then threw out everything that wasn't black or slightly darker black.  That he's quoting Halo and not Ford? Took me forever to get Indiana Jones. I was playing the Wii version, and it turns out that if you use any cheat codes (because I liked some of the cosmetic ones) before beating all the levels, you can't finish the fourth level of the third episode. HOW TO GET GUY'S BRICKS EVERYTIME! 100% LEGIT! [Gone Wrong] You thought *stepping* on Lego bricks was bad. Lego island 2 was the better shit THE BRICKSTER'S LOOSE! THE BRICKSTER'S LOOSE!!!  Right?

Edit: *Write?* To be fair, an uncaptioned picture of a potted plant is a better love story than Twilight. And people call you a bridge-builder? That's a strange way to get people to recognize your accomplishments...  [Courage & Hope. Easy tigrr. Coming soon.](http://i.imgur.com/cFfA5T6.jpg) Exactly.  PM me when it happens for you, and I will pile on the fake internet points as further proof you have arrived. The game isn't exactly perfect, but I have no idea how they just left it like that. Like did they run out of time and be like, "Nah, it kinda works sooooo put it in there boys"? I discovered that the best character for the land and air races is Slimer... he's an incredibly fast flyer, but a bit easier to control than the Wicked Witch. The upgraded Batmobile (with increased speed and jumping ability) is also *very* good for the ground races.

The best options for swimming are either Gollum or Cragger... I can't remember which one's easier to control. Yeah, that was a big gripe of mine as well.  Overall it just felt like a huge add on from Marvel Superheroes rather than a new game.  And it started feeling very tedious early on because of that. kill it with fire. Ahh, memories of getting dragged off an edge to my death because my buddy kept wandering off. "Listen here you little shit..."
-Me to my little brother every 30 seconds Now you can't run to the left as they're trying to jump to a ledge and get them killed! New Rumble mode coming out tomorrow as well. Turns the game into Mario Kart Battle mode, while still playing a game of car soccer. here's a trailer: https://youtu.be/7iz-dQifR7Q In fact, I am buying 2 more controllers and a fucking PROJECTOR to be able to play 2v2 in my room with my buddies. Rocket league being 95% why I'm buying 2 more controllers and 50% why I'm buying a projector, probably wouldn't buy a projector though if I didn't love rocket league so much. It's that good huh? Guess I gotta get it then That's the one coop game I refuse to play alone. (But it sucks because I have don't have friends who sit long enough to play a videogame) Also made it hard as fuck to complete solo Same boat. I just can't play it for more than an hour.  Same boat but just for the second one. Idk what it is. Playing the second for more than 30 minutes is a chore. Can play the first endlessly.  [deleted] Oh I read it wrong  One of the worst to me was FF 13. Okay max out all characters crystal grids and get some really strong weapons along the way so you can beat the hardest enemies. Challenging but there was a point.

But then there is the trophy for getting EVERY SINGLE variation and upgrade of every single weapon and accessory in the game- which includes grinding out the hardest enemies in the game for like a 10% drop rate for an item, which you then need to collect like 3 or 4 of per weapon you want to make. so not only do you have to do tons of pointless farming, you then have to spend 20 minutes per kill on a beast of an enemy somewhere between 30-100 times hoping for the drops to make the weapons to complete the achievement. Watch the first cut scene the game plays on load: 50g True that. Even in RuneScape, an MMORPG, the Completionist Cape can still be obtained with minimal multiplayer action, and neither the Completionist or the Completionist Plus capes require PvP thank god They don't require multiplayer. You can grind every single covenant item in Dark Souls 1-3 from certain enemies. Albeit it takes much longer that way Riku level 99 + beat the game 6 times makes it obvious Square didn't realize what they were doing

Thankfully 2.5 fixed that mostly I honestly liked it more than the Avengers game. Having the X-men in the game was awesome. The ONLY thing that was better about the Avengers game, IMO, was the hold-down-jump thing you could do with Hulk. Yeah, Lego LOTR had one of the best collection mechanics. In most other games, collecting stuff doesn't really get you anything except new characters. Yes there are, and both of them are Harry Potter 2.

[Achivement Unlocked!](http://i.imgur.com/sh6LaSs.gif) I played with my last girlfriend and it was unbelievably aggravating, and I'm a very patient person. My girl only wants to try Portal 2 from time to time. She has to be pretty excited to offer. no way! i've done this the past 3 years...crazy mane. im usually boozed out after the holiday season too.  Neat! [It's a long story mother.](http://i.imgur.com/OofxhY4.gif) Pfft, not everyone's life choices revolve around that show you know? God damn it, no wonder i couldn't finish it.  Thanks for the tip!  I am just starting that one. What changes to stop you completing it?

Reminds me of the original Mirror's Edge. If it detected you had a pirate copy them before a big jump in the first level, it would slow you down to walking speed and it was impossible to make it across. For me there was a major glitch with the Last Crusade boss in Indiana Jones 2. They would suck up the player character wherever they were, effectively making the level impossible without a second player. And if you restarted the level, the boss would remain spawned.

Eventually I found a workaround. "only friends" - 2016 WITH HER BOOB COMIN' OUT Tryin to make a change :-\ True Write back at you!  To be fair, your description of a picture of said potted plant is a better love story than Twilight. The Roman's feeding Christians to lions was a better love story than Twilight. my ex husband loved twilight and dragged me to each movie. after the third, I knew it was over. couldnt be with a "man" who loved twilight........... If there's a bee in that picture, it's practically Say Anything compared to Twilight.  Holy shit.. I've made it. I was there...I was there when he appeared... Oh fuck I witnessed history. I'm concerned of Lionsgate's involvement in this project.  Their bias might prevent them from telling the *whole* story. > Courage

so does that mean he doesn't have a headphone jack? I like how it's Lionsgate but tiger fur. Well this is new. What software do you use? Photoshop, I'm assuming It happened. And the memories of intentionally trying to drag each other off to death for ten minutes before getting serious again and continuing the level... or the classic, "I would have made that jump if your slow ass didn't halt the screen mid-way and make me eat shit" This reminds me of one of my more fun game nights; Super Mario Bros Wii with 3 other friends. The catch was there was no hitting left, you went full-on, balls to the wall, right and running only. You could bubble to avoid your death, but the intent was to kill the other 3 as best you could while reaching the finish first. It was nuts.  Oh no

the nightmares are coming back


*OH NO* 99% of the fun of console arpg's was going co-op and being "that guy" that is going to park you both in one area for 5 minutes until your friend stops trying to progress and lets you get to that chest you saw What a god damn good trailer Be careful, input lag can be an issue with fast paced games like RL. I had a projector and it had a fast mode which helped, but there was still  a bit of latency.  I actually completed it all on my own first before I got a friend to play coop and I was like "Oh my God what have I been doing with my life"  It really is a game that needs coop to work properly. Difficulty is too low or high on single player as bosses sometimes rely on you resing each other but normal play is boring. 

Then conversely I've known games where four people have LAN'd the first level of borderlands 1 and used all their ammo on one skag then had to spend 10 minutes beating it until it died.  As I 100%'d the game, I can mostly agree to this.  I usually play in a 'completionist' style anyway, exploring all nooks and crannies...so I didn't have to replay through for any of the items that were missable.  However it wasn't really as bad as you made it out to be, eventually you get strong enough that those enemies are pretty trivial.  Fighting all of the ultra strong hunt missions was really fun.  I had more fun with going 100% on the game than I did with the main story, the combat system is actually pretty solid, despite the criticism...but NOT in the main story, because you can do the whole game in one formation. 

As for the Adamantoise farming, you can get that down pretty quick too so it isn't 20 minutes per kill, but I still get it.  Honestly, the 100% in this game is much more achievable than most games that have multiplayer trophies, with much less grinding. I actually got every single item in ff xiii and the achievement didn't pop. Thought I missed something, nope. Everything fully upgraded, dozens of hours put in, no achievement. I have every achievement in 13-2 and 13-3, missing that one achievement in 13-1. I'm still salty Defeat the incredibly difficult bonus boss that will take you >40 tries to beat?

Complete the entire game without taking a single bit of damage *ever*? [Silver.](http://psnprofiles.com/trophy/536-MEGA-MAN-10/12-MR-PERFECT)

 No mans sky is that you?  I only played Marvel Superheroes because it came with my PS4. Would never have entertained the idea of purchasing a Lego game before but it sucked me in and I got many hours worth of entertainment in it.  Really impressed with how much stuff there is to do in that game. bah, caption updated Risky click of the day I think he was talking about anal HAPPY CAKEDAY!!! It's neature!
 -4 because relevant username was overlooked? He was being sarcastic guys stop downvoting him and look at his username >:( HOLY SHIT THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHUNG I GOT SO MAD AT THAT FYCKING GAME FUCK LEGO FUCK NINTENDO FUCK EVERYONE I WASTED MY LIFE FUCK

EDIT: DON'T EVEN GIVE A FUCK ABOUT SPELLING ERRORS IM LEVONGTHEM IM NOT WASTING ANY MORE TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS PIECE OF SHIT GAME It freezes. The "trying to make a change :-\" is like my favorite meme ever.  SLAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMIIIIIINNNNGGGG *Social Experiment* GONE SEXUAL He was describing a picture of a plant, not a real plant.  Easy mistake to make, it sounds like it was a very realistic photograph being described. The origin of your divorce is still a better love story than twilight. Tell us, what is it like? Are the stories of it true? Congrats, it's a boy! Yep.  Fake internet points all around.  You get an upvote...you get an upvote... Who needs PvP when youve got shared screen co-op? Having depleted your "True whatever" gauge in the process.  These days I just stand on a button that makes a bridge or something and say "I *promise* this time I won't jump off when you try to cross, disabling the bridge and sending you plunging to your death"

but of course I do, and my gf falls to her death, and I laugh and laugh every time.

The best is when there's a crane or something that lets you pick up and move enemies around. I always chase her around with the crane so I can toss her off the ledge. Or kill every single orc at the start on the Southern Gate before going up the tower in Return of the King Fair enough. I'm most bitter over that trophy because I got everything (at least i thought i did) and I couldn't get the trophy to pop. But I had dismantled a few things here and there to get materials for making other things- didn't hold them all at once (since i read you didn't need to). 

So there I am with an incomplete inventory, and no idea how to tell what was missing. I shut the game off and never turned it back on. Wasn't there a way where you could get a certain amount of the items, break down your weapons, use the Trapozohedrons to make your T3 weapons, then reload the save or something and it would still count for you that you made those weapons and so only needed to do the others? Missables are what make me not want to 100% games. If I know that games have missables, I have to have gamefaqs open on my phone the entire time and constantly reference because I'm paranoid that I'm going to miss something and have to replay everything.

It takes the fun out of it. THANK YOU!!! He just got into the danger zone  Oh... That's not as fun 23 -tryin to make a change :-\ >The "trying to make a change :-\" is like my favorite meme ever. Tryin to make a change :-\ 


FTFY

 Need to break this $10

Tryin to make change :-\ There's just a certain beauty to it. Anyway, even an untaken picture of a yet unpotted plant would be a better love story than twilight. Yes, don't forget about us little people. Yep. And then you got the last level of the first Lego Star Wars where you genuinely do have to beat each other up at the end. Portal 2 Is anyone old enough to remember Chip N' Dale Rescue Rangers for the NES? It's amazing how cooperative gameplay can make people hate each other and make me not speak to my brother since 1991.  Magicka is a game for you  We used to do that every time we played that level. Always competing to see who would get the most kills.   

Leave none alive!  Yep, I can totally see how that would be frustrating AF.  You would basically have to replay the game, or double-up. To be fair, they weren't wrong...you don't need to hold them all at once...just if you dismantle them good luck remembering what you did and did not have. Lol Agreed.  It is annoying, I think there were only 2 in this game though, and the game wasn't all that long. Also, they weren't anything huge, it honestly just seemed like design oversight on the achievement. It was nothing like FF12's weapon that you had to like...skip a certain treasure chest, and open a certain over one in a specific order or whatever that crap was.  happy birthday man! 24 karmas for you With your help, we could rewrite history Tryin to make a change :-\ A brief description of the unplanted seed with its Latin name and instructions for care, and no plans for a picture at all, would be a better love story than twilight.



Am I too late? [Dead War. Even the little people deserve a shot. Coming soon.](http://i.imgur.com/UDgjXSA.jpg) And the unimportant ones of average height! My brother (always Aragon) had the upper hand on me till I got the Mithril arrows.  Then I'd always have more kills so it turned into "who can get more perfects!" Yeah I remember that one. And if you didn't do it, you not only missed out on an item, that item happened to be the strongest weapon in the entire game!

Total BS. Do you have a signature on your comments?  Ok now I'm jealous.  I'm your biggest fan! In this thread at least...I mean I'm the one who knew your name...where's my love? Playing as Legolas made you feel like such a badass in that game. Yeah that's the one! I think they changed it in the re-release because they realized what a crock of shit it was. Haha holy has it been a full 3 years since gtav?  They also discovered how to sell the same game multiple times. Its pretty shit that we'll never get story dlc for this game when it has potentional to be amazing.  Chinatown Wars was the shit I don't think Rockstar is getting all their money from microtransactions... you know given that GTAV is still topping the NPD 3 years after release http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/15/august-2016-npd-madden-no-mans-sky-lift-summer-game-spending/ oh my god , midnight club, i totally forgot about that nostalgic game.now i know what ill do this weekend. Its not microtransactions, theyre just being more carful with their IP. They made a billion dollars in 24 hours and have charted on NPD every month for 3 years straight. They arent even charting low, they chart in the top 5 often. 

They could annualized GTA and make money hand over fist, but they dont. They are starting to handle their games like Bethesda, release the trailer and then the games out in 4-6 months. Just be patient, give them time, and theyll come through with a quality product like they always do. Ehhh.... As long as their next game is really good who cares? Would you prefer GTA 6 to be a GTA 5 clone with different guns and a 5 hour single player or would you prefer a completely redone game in a different city, on a bigger map, with more activieties Or they just ran out of franchises.

Max Payne is over.  Midnight Club isn't profitable.  Bondi is dead, so no LA Noire follow up.  Red Dead was a slow hit, it didn't sell enough up front to warrant jumping immediately to a sequel, but they're making one now.

GTA V, on the other hand. Is massive and seeing massive player numbers and reasonable sales years onward.  They've got more free updates in the books that'll keep'em going until RD2 (or is it 3?).  I don't think rockstar makes half as much on micro as any other F2P game in Steam's top 50 games. [deleted] How i would love to see another midnight club It takes *YEARS* to make an open world game and that work can't start until their engine has been modified for the new generation.  Same thing happened with GTA 4, that game released three years after the consoles dropped. At $100 usd for $8mil in GTA online, there is nothing micro about those purchases. I just want a sequel to Smuggler's Run. Can you pinpoint the day they completely forgot that single player exists??? Sort of off topic but, am I weird that I'm not at all interested in multiplayer gaming? Rockstar has added so much to GTA online, and I couldn't care any less. I want more single player dlc! Man, LA Noire was so good.  I played it relentlessly when I moved apartment and didn't have Internet.  I enjoyed it so much that I bought it again for PC.

Really wish they'd make another game along these lines, but I'm sure it's not not the cash cow Rockstar really cares about. Or you know, taking their time to make something huge and amazing.. Good games take time to develop. It's cheecky as fuck what they're doing with GTA 5.

Here is this wonderfully big world which we've carefully designed over years which maybe 1/5 of all GTA players even play online (still a lot with GTA 5's playerbase size) and we're only going to release dlc that adds the simplest of content. A couple of vehicles, maybe weapons and some online modes.

Not a single campaign-based DLC to be found. What. The. Shit? Releases all dlc for free, and continues to actively support the game years after its launch. But wait, they have optional micro transactions so I had better bitch and moan about it. 

Edit: reddit gold? Thank you stranger, but don't you know that gold is the micro transaction of reddit and is there for a tool of the devil? 

Joking aside, this is actually a perfect example of what I am talking about. Let's say hypothetically that my reddit account is my gtao character. I have been on reddit/gta for a few years and never spent a dime of real world money. Yet here I am, enjoying higher perks, (yes I know technically this would be more like a f2p vs p2p situation bit bear with me) simply because I played the game.  As someone who hates GTAOnline, this sucks. Time for a Manhunt reboot! I liked RDR. Was hoping that they would bring it to XBONE as like an MMO type game. Setup a server where 100 or so people could go into the old west and drink whiskey, gamble till late and then have a shootout at high noon while all hung over. Setup a bounty board for the marshals to find out who is wanted and let the game commence. Just like other survival games ala ARK: Survival Evolved or H1Z1.  No one seems to be mentioning that they have been releasing free updates pretty consistently for GTA online. That means that the people who pay, pay. The people who don't pay, get free content. It seems like a win/win for me and the game is still great.

Take your time Rockstar, just make it good. Takes rockstar a long time to make games because they make the best ones. Or that it takes a lot of time, money, and talent to make these games. 

All these games aren't made by the exact same teams, they have studios around the world. Team Bondi which worked on LA Noire is now Defunct. The multiple Rockstar studios have different amount of contributions to each game and with each of their games getting bigger and more costly It will take more time or manpower to accomplish them.

If you look at LA Noire and Max Payne 3 they are both really polished and amazing games, but they aren't the size of a GTA game for the most part. 

LA noire has more simplistic mechanics because it is more of a narrative and a detective game, the gunplay and driving don't have to be the focal point so you don't have to go crazy with that. 

Max Payne 3 has a cool story, Gunplay, crazy physics. It is also way linear than say Red Dead, or GTA.

Those 2 Games wouldn't take as long to make because the scale is way smaller. 

Now GTA V is Massive and they are still supporting it and adding content, Hell they even ported it to PC and ps4 and xbox one. It originally was released for Xbox 360 and Ps3.

The Next game they are working on is rumored to be Red Dead Redemption 2 so that will probably be just as Massive as GTA5 if not bigger! 

That being said of course it takes them awhile to produce new content. The bar keeps being raised and they also raise their own bar themselves. With the high standards they have they probably are more careful with their content as well.

Not that they don't care about microtransactions, but it's more complicated than that. Rockstar did not make LA Noire and Chinatown Wars is a mobile game. Hardly what I would call in the scope of RDR or GTA V. I would kill for another Midnight Club. I loved the way Rockstar created those cities. The way you could go up on two wheels to squeeze through tight spaces. I also loved the way they built jumps into the city. Nothing is better than a dope jump. I love driving games and I loved the way cars handled in Midnight Club games. Another Midnight Club would make me sooo happy! This is so shitty. It is everything that's wrong with the gaming industry today and I hate it. I sold my copy of GTA V because I just couldn't take it anymore. Yeah the story mode was spectacular, but online was fucking horrible. Can't even drive a hundred feet from my garage without getting killed by bored griefers in jets or tanks.  All looks good still, Rockstar North took 5 years to make GTAV after IV and if Rockstar San Diego or Rockstar Leeds release a game soon it would still fit the chart looking at the individual developer. 
Dont let my name sway you, I'm trying to be rational here. I wish they would move on from GTA online or add a mode to play it like gta 4 it's ridiculous how much everything costs in terms of ingame currency and it's part of the reason I never play it anymore  But you can also see that they didn't charge players anything since the release.

Every new gameplay mode, race mode, vehicles, yatches and other stuff came for free.  


Many other companies would charge a shit ton of money from players for that.  If it means they keep updating GTA Online for free I'm all for it.  GTA V has been the best return on my investment in 20 years of gaming. 2017: Red Dead Redemption 2 - Legends of the West  
2018-2020: GTA VI Lets not pretend Chinatown Wars and Beaterator are on the same level as GTA 4/5, Red Dead, or the others GTA V came out *three* years ago? Wtf?! Max Payne 3 was such an underrated game. Phenomenal story telling. Imma go punch some money into GTAv right now, and I am going to blow up all your personal vehicles. Tonight. If you are out there... I'm starting now and you are going to go to pick it up and I will blow it up again. marketing and profit has been sucking the soul out of video games  I would rather have to wait 3-4 years for a new game then have have them push out a mediocre game every year. Also they didn't develope LA Noire, just published, and max payne 3 didn't sell very well I'm still waiting for the day I can pick this game up for under 20 dollars during a steam sale. Did this for GTAIV, had to wait 5 years or so after release.. Just gotta hold out for a few more years.. ;-; Haha.  It's funny because you stupid kids buy them. Gta V is that many years old now? Fuck. I just want red dead 2 before the next gta This isn't really accurate.  Rockstar North are the ones who developed the GTA series and they are on a semi-regular schedule,  though developing GTA V for the next generation and PC probably used up some resources. The other games here are either just published by Rockstar LA Noise,  or by their other studios: Rockstar UK,  Rockstar San Diego,  Rockstar Leeds,  etc.  You can also pin point the re-release of GTAV and extended development times of titles now. Max Payne 3 was in development for nearly 9 years. The more advanced graphics get, the longer its going to take to get sequels and new titles if you want AAA releases. [removed] What was it someone said about Valve? They don't make games anymore - they make money now. So true, Gaming isn't what it once was.. games are better, The industry is messed up I love the singleplayer GTA, but I despise that senseless online-crap they're already milking for years. Rockstar also can't critisize the system anymore. They have become the system with GTA Online. gta V is still $60. absolutely ridiculous to me. Isnt red dead redemption 2 coming out in 2017? To be fair tho. Most (all?) new content in gta v is free. I really hope they will release another red dead, it's one of my favorite games and I really miss playing it after I sold my ps3. So much to work with as well. Still crossing my fingers for a Bully sequel. Correction: The year Take Two found the power of micro transactions. Rockstar still has to adhere to their publishers business model. Microtransactions are evil. 


 Damn I would kill for a new Midnight Club. It sucks, they even stopped adding the DLC vehicles and weapons in the singeplayer so if you want to try them out either install a mod that might get you banned, grind for hours or buy fucking shark cards. Everyday Rockstar continue to milk its customers the more respect I lose for them. L.A. Noire is five years old? I didn't realise Max Payne 3 came out that long ago either...Damn time has flown by so quickly. Would anyone care to explain what they are planning to make next? I need more rockstar In my life.  I'd believe they're just working on bigger projects now.

I think I'm giving up on Agent though  This just shows, if you spend money on "micro"transactions you are hurting the industry. If only they had a microtransaction to turn the fucking cops off. I'd pay out the ass for that. Don't play GTA, had no idea it had micro-transactios.  Don't expect GTA 6 until like 2019 at least. Fuck i thought red dead 2 was coming next year? All of their studios were working on V though. Once it was released, the split up work. Some worked on multi-player additions, some on the newer consoles and PC version, some on the next Red Dead and possibly some on the next Bully. They weren't doing much concurrent work with GTA V like they were with most other games on the list.  GTA set in Chicago or NYC or London in 1968. 

Or a GTA inspired game set in 1943 occupied Paris. 

Please Rockstar.  Its sad really. Microtransactions, pay to win and DLC is destroying gaming for me as a consumer. I cant buy a game without the worry of 2 mo ths down the line ill need to hand over another £15-30 to even stand a chance or to even receive the full experience. Its a shame. It felt off to me because it was released for PC in April 2015 GTA IV being 8 years old makes me feel even older, tbh. That's a long time to work on GTA:VI Vice city ( or New Orleans if you'll indulge some wishful thinking) Yup. 3 years on the 17th of this month.  It's still in the front page of the Australian PS Store as a new release for PS4 and $99.94... I bought it for ps3 at a pretty sweet price (like $30 NZD) over a year ago, now I have a ps4 and the cheapest I can find it it's $80+ which seems absurd. Still seeing gifs and videos of the game. Skyrin still sees some sharing as well. Happens when you make a great game. no they just rereleased it 3 years in a row I did end up buying it 3 times because I'm an idiot... I bought the original Xbox 360 version and it ended up being the game that I ended that generation on. I've thought about going back and playing the PC version, but I got everything I want to get out of that game. 

Edit: a word The key point was intentionally missleading fans by not answering questions about PS4 and PC releases. It's not our fault for buying it on PS3. It was all we knew was coming.  The irritating part is that they said there would be story DLC during pre-release interviews and now they've openly admitted that they've indefinitely delayed story DLC in favor of pumping out more updates for GTAO Gay Tony was great was really hoping for something similar for gta5 Dont be so sure about that. A while ago someone leaked that the next 3 updates were going to be biker gangs, a hunting update and then a big expansion that will include san fierro and las venturas. Well rockstar just officialy announced that the next update for GTAO will be adding the ability to form biker gangs complete with new bikes and clubhouses. This does seem like quite the stretch but so far the leak is correct and I am keeping my fingers crossed. Story DLC would be a perfect way for them to introduce changes to the map that would transfer over to online. If this was something they decided to do I would guess it would be a bit more involved than a standard dlc. 

Gives me a little bit of hope.  [In 2013](http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51955/GTA-Online-Update-Free-Deathmatch-Race-Creators-this):

>GTAV Story Mode Updates. For those ready to jump back into the story of Grand Theft Auto V, we have big plans for substantial additions in 2014 continuing Michael, Franklin and Trevor's action, mayhem and unexpected adventures in Southern San Andreas.

It's severely disappointing that R* completely went against their word about offering single-player DLC, instead focusing on the micro-transaction side of the game. At the very least they should bring the Online stuff over to single-player. Let me buy new houses and play with all the toys that Online has. You've made your billions upon billions already, you're not going to lose much by locking everything into a game mode where you're forced spend real money to get all the fun stuff.

As it stands, I'm not really expecting single-player to get anything new. The occasional new car or weapon maybe, but I've completely given up on seeing any real DLC. I suspect we will see GTAV story DLC, which will be fairly cheap or free, to reengage GTAV players and nudge them to play GTAO. I enjoyed it a lot on the DS mostly being able to drive around buying and selling drugs, I didn't do much beyond that. It was like playing a Sid Meier game to me. To this day I'm sad 3DS never got its own GTA. Maybe Chinatown Wars 2 or something like that would have been awesome. I wished they would have implemented the drug dealing mini game into gta v, would have been so fun slangin kilos as trevor or franklin. Plus the ps4 and pc rerelease IIRC, they earn more than half of money by microtransactions. Seriously, GTAV is the best selling console game of all time, so long as you leave out $1 mobile games and the bundled Wii Sports.  That said, I'd love to see the number of Wii's sold with Wii Sports that no other games were every played on.  I bet its more than half. It's been consistent top seller for years on steam. I thought it was a bug, on my steam version. I used to play that game pretty much every day. It was so fun taking the cars in pink slip races  "Los Angeles" was a great game - the experience beats out most of the recent Need for Speed titles; great variety of cars (and motorcycles!) bottomless customization options, great soundtrack, and the whole atmosphere was great - it captured the fun in custom car culture, like going to different car meets and triggering impromptu races on-the-fly. The racing was legitimately challenging, the city was busy and looked alive, and the "storyline" was corny but charming because it never took itself too seriously. Just a guy who's new in town and wants to race and build fast cars/bikes. 

Kinda pissed that I lost all of my save files when my PS3 YLOD'd - shit took a long time to unlock. My saves are sitting on a hard drive and I don't know how to recover them. 

It had everything I wanted from newer Need for Speed titles and I don't know what happened with NFS. The latest reboot was decent and it looked great graphically, but other than that there wasn't much to it; it got pretty boring pretty quickly.  It was a pretty good game. I used MCLA to make a hype car for GTA V when it was coming to PC. http://imgur.com/a/pjGgp Jesus, me too. Remember that track that went through the bottom of the canal? My friends and I could 4-player splitscreen that track 20 times in a row without getting bored. 

This generation needs another Midnight Club, a genuinely fun Need for Speed title and, for the love of god, a Burnout game as good as Burnout 3.

#MakeRacingGamesGreatAgain Right, I think if anything they deserve props for the way they have done GTA V. I don't know how in today's world of gaming I paid standard price for a game and am still getting years of new content and great online play at absolutely no cost. 

I think it's the end of an era, unfortunately. I'd be surprised if anything like this at the AAA level ever came out again, the way things are moving to subscription and microtransactions.  I honestly like this method more. I hate the YEARS of hype leadup. Firaxis did this with Civ VI too, Announced in May, out in October. >  release the trailer and then the games out in 4-6 months

I think you misspelled 2 years Rockstar is a top tier developer. I really do think I have never been fucked over by them. Ive enjoyed every GTA Ive owned. Fucking loved RDR and spent a lot of time fucking around in Bully "hey are starting to handle their games like Bethesda" but Rockstar hasn't shown any signs of cutting features and removing weapons in favor of pathetic crafting. Quality product? References Bethesda? Have you been on r/gaming in the last year? Fallout 4 was sold to us in Alpha.  I would prefer RDR2 or an LA Noire sequelish rather than the next GTA >  Would you prefer GTA 6

Why are people acting like this is the only Rockstar franchise? It sucks Midnight Club didn't take off. It was my favourite racing game on the ps3.  Pls give Bully a sequel  I've said it before about LA Noire: it was a great environment/world, but, unlike in GTA, there was ZERO to actually do in it. Since you were the good guy, just getting from A to B, there was nothing to really do in this massive, awesome, 1940s world. 

What they need to do, is GTA: 1940. Let us tear up the 1940s in those awesome, old school cars, with old school guns. Shit would be fantastic. What about Manhunt? Max Payne is over?  I don't remember the ending being a definite "this is the end of Max Payne".  Maybe I missed something though. Im surprised to hear red dead redemption wasn't majorly successful at first. I remember when it came out everyone was raving about it.  It was reported about a month or so ago that R* has made about $600M from microtransactions so far. So although it's a LOT of money, they still make more from the game itself. >Or they just ran out of franchises.

create new franchises. But making gta is obviously more profitable than investing in something new and risky Are they really making a new Red Dead? If so I'm psyched.  Agent is still on the radar, remasters/collections are rumored every year for Rockstar, etc. It's not like they're just sitting  back going "let's devote all rockstar teams to creating online content, that'll pan out!" 

Not to mention, in the years the OP image states 'nothing' happened in, Rockstar was actually re-releasing GTA V that effectively acted like a visual remaster, added in a huge first person mode which I've never seen done in a re-release ever (or in an update). And all the online updates, which honestly cunning stunts is a lot of fun, and heists was phenomenal for those with friends to pull heists with.

I'm just really excited to see what the teams are working on, and what Agent will look like if it comes back into the spotlight. Thankfully, it doesn't seem like Take Two is pushing them to rush release games.  Max Payne is over just like Halo was over after 3? Just like how God of War is over? 

 Doesn't mean that there isn't a chance that LA Noire 2 could show up eventually.  The game did well financially, and Rockstar owns the IP, so they could turn it over to a new studio or take it on internally.

I'm with you though, I would LOVE to see a new game in that genre and period.  Ya, team bondi almost collapsed in production of LA Noir. I heard it was a shitty place to work, crushing deadlines, people who came onto the project midway or left during production not getting credit. Company was a shit show. I heard they were working on a new game called Whore of the Orient  (ooooooh edgy), but outside of 2 screen shots of an alleyway a few years ago followed by total silence, I think the company and game are dead. I'm thinking an NY Noire or something set in the 1960s. *Sigh*
One can dream. DUB edition was the shit  I'm kinda convinced they just merged it into GTA now I really hope it's a *new* engine and not just a rehash of the old engine.

There's refinement and then there's flogging a dead horse -- looking at you, *Bethesda* No one argues that it takes time, but they still managed to get a game a year out between GTA IV and GTA V 

I mean, it's the whole point of this (shitty) post, isn't it? But they don't need to modify for the new gen *again*.

GTAV came out for 360/PS3 and then, later, for Xbox One and PS4. The modifications are there (and there's very noticeable difference between the two generations). 

It's just easier to make money by changing an in-game dollar amount than it is to make a new game, even using the previous engine. Throw in some small content that requires a lot of in-game effort to get (or paying real money for it), and as long as you have a playerbase, you have a never ending cycle of money. What about non-GTA games? [deleted] I'm with you in giving zero fucks about multiplayer.  Just ask Valve! 5 years in this case. TBGT came out on PC April 2010. GTA: V came out on PC April 2015.  So are the games pictured here not good even though they were released within a year of each other? You aren't necessarily wrong, but for longtime Rockstar and GTA fans it sucks to see a company and series that have been singleplayer focused shift seemingly their entire emphasis to a quasi- free-to-play multiplayer version. I know I never bought a R* game for the multiplayer before, so it's unpleasant to see such a heavy content focus on the multiplayer Would you rather have endless amounts of that mediocre grindy DLC or a legit 20 hour single player expansion like EFLC or RDR Undead Nightmare? Its quantity vs quality. I will remember the single player DLC forever, but I will forget everything about GTA5s shitty online as soon as the next game comes out.

I still dont know why people play GTA:O, literally all I would do after completing the heists at level 40 or so is grief, fuck around with friends, ask hackers for money, and buy stuff with that money. Drive the car for a few minutes, then get bored and not play for days or weeks.

Game is waaaaay too grindy, they really needed to do more with heists, adopt a payday style system for example. A casual player is basically forced into buying the microtransactions in order to enjoy the game unless they want to grind all day and night until they get enough money to afford the stuff that come in those free updates. I not touched a pixel of DLC so it doesn't do much for me. Meanwhile the previous entry in the series I was able to enjoy plenty of DLC content. So yeah the DLC has ruined Rockstar for anyone who doesn't play GTA online (or really people that do but don't have hours to sink on acquiring in game currency to buy DLC items) All they've released is GTA Online DLCs. Doesn't matter if that shit is free, I don't want it and at least a few others agree with me.

I'd pay $20 today if I get a Ballad of Gay Tony-level story DLC for GTA V. I was hoping on loads of single player content, not crap online stuff im not sure they'd be able to get away with it, with this generations graphics The updates are free but the cars and boats and stuff are impossible to afford without grinding or paying for in game cash The way GTAV is designed implies they will intentionally hold off until they N E E D to release another one. Not to mention releasing it multiple times per platform [deleted] Agreed, ill play it a bit here and there if my friends are playing it, but i have 0 desire to do enough grindy repetitive activities to unlock all the cool crap some of my friends have They did make money though, since they locked that stuff behind Online where people are buying Shark Cards, thus paying for the content (they've made over $500 million just from the microtransaction stuff).

Now that R* understands how much money they can earn by locking stuff behind Online, I'm worried for the future of the franchise and what that will mean for the single-player side of things (remember, they said in 2013 that in 2014 they were releasing big single-player DLC, but they later said they were putting that aside to focus on Online-only content). While it is generous of them to provide so much free content, it would be nice to see them raise the money earned from missions or lower the prices slightly. I'm not arguing that its a pay-to-win game. But to an extent it is such, when I join a lobby and theres 5 people with tanks destroying my car and killing me. Meanwhile I can barely afford any decent car upgrades because they cost you a weeks worth of mission income.  > 2018-2020: ~~GTA VI~~ GTA V DLC

 > 2018-2020: GTA VI*ce City* >Most (all?) new content in gta v is free.

No. The new content in *GTA Online* is free*. It's like praising mobile devs for free updates.  Honestly surprised there hasn't been a sequel yet. From last reports Bully shipped 500k more copies than the first Red Dead game, which only came out two years earlier. 

And they released Red Dead Redemption only 6 years after the first one. It's been 10 years next month since Bully came out. 

 Yeah that graph isn't exactly accurate.  GTA V for next gen and PC was basically a full release and (according to them) it was a full effort.  L.A. Noire wasn't a Rockstar game, either.  Team Bondi developed it and Rockstar just published it.  So they've released a game every year since GTA V, each one has just been GTA V for a different gen or platform.

Edit: On top of that, the last two games before GTA V were relative failures.  Max Payne 3 only sold a few hundred* thousand copies at launch (I was the only person at the midnight opening there for it, as an anecdote), and LA Noire just did okay, inspired a controversy or two about working conditions, and didn't really have any longevity.  Yeah, they're going to try to make as much money as possible by providing long term support for the highest/quickest selling game of all time.  They're producing free DLCs that are better than most games and continue to support and breathe new life into a multiplayer game mode three years after its release.

Edit 2: Gamers bitch when games are annualized and low quality because of fast production cycles, gamers bitch when a major studio doesn't release a new game every single year.  There is no winning with you people.

edit 3: thanks for the gold kind stranger! Thank you for making me stop doubting my sanity. I wouldn't count that as a release though, GTA V came out in 2013. It's like saying the bioshock remaster is a new release.  And it's still $60 on the steam store... That can't be right. 8 years?

No you're right. Fuck I was sober back then.. Weird and then there are those of us who played the first one... Why not both ? Mafia III is covering the open world New Orleans this Gen. Praying on Rockstar to bring back Miami. Very exciting. Forget that. Rather prefer a big change of scenery - Shanghai, Tokyo, Bangkok pls GTA: VIce Fuck that. **RED DEAD!** Started to laugh at you, but then thought:

"PS3, PC, PS4 ........ god damnit...." The PS4/PC experience is miles better, there obviously aren't many gameplay differences but if you can get it on a good sale I highly recommend it. 

e: get the PC version, not ps4 They also said there would be heists soon after release. And that there would be an online stock market. 


*so yeaaaah...* They were saying it after the game released, too. 

In December 2013, when the game had been out for 4 months, they announced that story DLC would be coming in 2014. 

Now it's almost 2017. I don't think it's coming. Dammit really?  No story mode DLC?  Fuck.  I asked that question a couple of days ago here on Reddit and got no answer.  That sucks, especially if you have no immediate plans to play online. I agree, that sucks. Story DLC would be fantastic. And the focus on online especially sucks since the last 10 or so times I've played GTAO it has just been a hacker fest with invincible assholes teleporting around either griefing people or spawning millions of dollars.

Have they done anything to address/fix that yet or are they still just squeezing out the microtransactions?

GTA5 is one of my favourite games of the last decade. Single player was stellar, online a blast with the right people. But at some point the online experience really went to shit. And I still don't understand why I *still* can't permanently store a fucking car in single player. What's the fun in GTAO when to do anything you have to pay micro transactions? Why not just do whatever you want in single player? That's what I've always done in GTA games...never thought multiplayer would add much to it. Yeah Gay Tony was the funnest GTA campaign I've played. Beat it in one sitting, couldn't put it down. That DLC was pure bliss. Loved the music especially. A well renowned police investigator picks up on Niko's trail of crime and his deep roots with powerful people, and finds him a key asset and immediately begins the hunt.

To escape the heat, Niko moves to Los Santos where he meets with Packie and asks to stay at his place. Packie talks of the heists he pulled off with a certain trio of criminals and Niko insists he's done with a life of crime. Or so he thought. 

Meanwhile, one of Packie's associates/cousins catches wind of the reason Niko moved and contacts the investigator. The investigator follows Niko to Los Santos and thus ensues heists, police chases, confrontations, and more in GTA V: Don't Call It A Comeback (working title) 

 Hey Lost and Damned was still really good though you have to admit! Less content than boGT I suppose but I really enjoyed that story. Too bad all those things will cost $10M to do. Does anyone remember when YouTubers or people would say that their would be casino (Betting & Gambling) and horse racing or that was just me and my friends? Those are all online, micortransaction based updates. What OP meant was that it will never get a single price, standalone update (i.e. Lost & Damned). The GTA Online update will be all about multiplayer play around new content which costs microtransactions. That's basically the model for almost every developer now i.e. hats hats hats. I would be pumped for a san fierro and las venturas expansion but thats pretty much it. It's been a few years time for a new full game. It wasn't a leak. The Bikers DLC was a leak but the rest of the stuff is unsupported speculation. I think that was debunked. I doubt they'll add ANYONE single player content :( Yeah, san fierro and las venturas in 2018. Nice. Where's the leak? Link?  Please be right, the DLC for GTA4 with the biker gangs (the lost and the something?) was by far the best DLC gta ever had. Just the fact they redid some of the mechanics of riding a motorcycle and fighting on a motorcycle was cool enough, but the story was absolutely amazing too. And the content was great! I've been waiting for a map extension DLC for two years now, and I get the feeling that I'll still be waiting until they release GTA6. And possibly Xbox one?? That's specifically why I don't every play GTAV. I bought the PS3 one, and when I eventually got a PS4 I didn't want to shell out 80$ for a game I already had. It's still priced at 50$, and at this point I don't really feel a need to go back to the game whatsoever. quite sad there isnt a continuation though :( Midnight Club 2 was AMAZING on the PS2 for me. LA was not as good as 2 in my opinion. Free roam in LA, Paris and Tokyo was awesome. hopefully rockstar puts their big dick on the table and shows everyone whats up when they release their next game. if they hold out, and continue to make DLC's free, they could possibly make it less popular for other companies to make it pay to play pretty much. i think we all need to boy cot EA hahaha Halo 5 is still getting free new content every month or so and it's just about a year old.  I actually think that the income from micro transactions is allowing them to continue creating free content. I'll admit now that GTA V is figured out Rockstar is doing good with it. When it initially released it was a shit show. I had to recreate my character 5 times which was beyond frustrating. Aside from that, the low pay and ridiculous prices for everything it's a great game.  Firaxis is legitimately one of my favorite game companies out there. They have their faults, don't get me wrong-- XCOM2 launched buggy, Civ BE was essentially a reskin of Civ V with less flavor, and vanilla Civ V lacks depth-- but they listen to their fan base, and they admit when they eff up, and they work to make things better than they were originally. 

XCOM2 has seen significant patching that was a top priority before the port to consoles. The DLC may not have been the best of all time, but it added enough interesting new mechanics to keep things fresh, and it intentionally laid a better groundwork for modders and gave us hella fan service (even if we still don't know the ultimate fate of Dr. Sexy)

The Civ V expansions corrected the issues that were noticed, and they introduced new and interesting gameplay with trade routes and tourism. Civ VI learned the lessons of BE, and didn't play anything safe; they completely revamped the whole system with something new, and it may flop, but I think it has potential. And they made those changes based on feedback-- making lower poly graphics so that older machines can handle it quicker, changing how the tech tree works, adding in tools for modders right from the get-go-- hell, even remodeling Roosevelt's jowels after people complained about them, and said he looked too flabby!

In short, maybe their end product isn't always the greatest game that came out that year-- but they're always working to improve, they're (almost) always innovating (looking at you, Beyond Earth), and they're always, without a doubt, trying to give you a great game that amounts to pennies per hour of entertainment.  I love me some Bethesda, but yeah, Fallout 4 is hands-down the worst performing AAA game with the worst graphics. There are korean MMO's with 20x better looking graphics engines and optimization. I would love a GTA game based in the same kinda time period as LA Noire. Maybe base it in Chicago or Las Vegas as well, to mix it up even more.

But I would love a RDR2 even more. 2017: Red Dead Redemption 2 - Legends of the West (wish granted!) Where do you think they could go with L.A. Noire? I'd love to see a sequel set in the 60s/70s era - of course they'd have to change the name accordingly. I think it'd be cool to have your character go through the process of becoming an undercover cop, getting heavily involved in the gang/drug world while gathering clues and solving crimes - that'd give the game a chance to have a little more action than "Noire" to keep things fresh.  I hated being such a goody two shoes in LA NOire. I want to play as an old timey marion cobretti and smash heads into interrogation tables. I mean, it took off, it just died later on. Midnight Club 1 was really popular and Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition was amazing (I never played 2).

LA was just pretty uninspired compared to its competitors. I'd still love a new one, though. Well, Forza Horizon 3 is out next week... people always thinks that it was a game about being a bully, but actually is about fighting bullies, even those that were bullied and became the bullies themselves, like the nerds and the main character itself. Fun times aka what i always want when i buy a mafia franchise game. GTA 1940 would be neat. But LA Noir isn't about the same style of gameplay as GTA. You were solving cases, interrogating, putting clues together. It wasn't perfect, but in hindsight it probably was the best game of detective I've ever had a chance to play and would love to see someone else try to do something along the same lines. A giant open world isn't really necessary, though. A nice touch for setting, but certainly a huge waste of resources. GTA: Chicago

Setting up a bootlegger empire would be epic. Mafia 2 fits that niche nicely. However Rockstar could blow that out of the water if they felt like it. You will love The Saboteur then. It's a good game. the godfather games were great for this actually, loads of fun There were something like 50 random sidequests you get from driving around all over the map. GTA 6 set in Vice City during the 40's/50's could be nice. Where is our Bladerunner style GTA.  I would play that forever. Plus the whole "drive like a normal person" thing got old after a while. 

It was definitely interesting and I enjoyed it for what it was, but I really wouldn't be interested in a sequel.  Penis jokes sells better than ultra violence. Manhunt was such a fantastic and edge of your seat game and story. It deserves a better sequel than that glitch riddled Manhunt 2.   I would really like a modern manhunt. It was successful at being tense and gruesome, but also being fun to play. Man, I really liked Manhunt 1 and 2, but I don't think the stealth and executions system would be good for today's standarts, and because of the violence it probably would be prohibited and censored in a lot of places. Honestly, I'd be upset if they keep it going. I mean, how much more can that guy realistically go through before putting a gun in his mouth? 


At least he seemed relatively at peace at the end of 3 I was under the impression that was "the end", but I suppose it wasn't definite.  We haven't heard anything about the franchise for awhile and interest certainly seems to have petered out for the most part. > Agent

Oh damn, it's been so long. Hope it won't end up like Blizzard's project "Titan". > It's not like they're just sitting back going "let's devote all rockstar teams to creating online content, that'll pan out!" 

At last public count, GTAV microtransactions had yielded [half a billion dollars.](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-online-mode-has-generated-half-a-billion-do/1100-6438765/) So it's not too unreasonable that that they are kicking their feet up.  Agent's been around since the original Xbox, I'd be amazed if it ever gets released. > Thankfully, it doesn't seem like Take Two is pushing them to rush release games.

Yeah, no shit [I asked about Whore of the Orient last year as it seems like an awesome concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3aex0f/anyone_know_whats_going_on_with_whore_of_the/).  Sounds like it's as dead as dead can be.  Shame. Why? The RAGE engine is already a technical marvel from pretty much every facet, regardless of whether on PC or console. 

Making a new engine wouldn't only be pointless, it's be taking a step backwards. The can log the dead horse all they want as long as they **actually include the horses**

looking at you GTAV horse track. Why? Vice City and San Andreas used the same engine as 3 and they were amazing. Theres no reason to spend years of development making a new engine every time they want to make a new game in the framchise. I'm confused when people complain about Bethesda's engines.  You realize they're still some of the best selling games out there?  If you're playing RPGs, I'd much rather have the creators spending their budget on story, not making my sword not jerk around a bit when I swing at a fucking crab.  I don't play RPGs to watch a little digital man beautifully swing his sword/axe around.  There's plenty of games that do that. This is a huge misunderstanding. Almost all games nowadays use heavily modified engines based on the Quake engine. You don't make a new engine if you don't have to, you improve it.

Bethesda does not need a new game engine, they need to clean up their graphics engine.

 I think Doom looks amazing (playing it now). Didn't realise it was a flogged horse. > flogging a dead *armored* horse


FTFY I actually quite like the grind and starting out with nothing, but I don't really play GTA in a GTA way.

What put me off multiplayer was the loading times. *Laughter, then sobbing.* Also worth bearing in mind that their teams will have worked in parallel to a degree. Initial groundwork for GTA:V might have started as early as 2008.

 Yeh I hate that I'm forced to actually play the game more to unlock the more rare items they give me  I think they'd be fine, honestly.  That game was controversial because of the time it came out.  I've seen worse in modern games. 2018-2020: Lowrider Update 2

 I want to see the 3 character come back, maybe your a dirty cop, then you have the criminal you work with, then you have the cop trying to find the criminal and weed out the dirty cop.
 It's confusing. There's so much potential. Everyone assumed a sequel would have to continue Jimmy's story, but that's like assuming the GTA series had to focus on one character. The next one could just be a new student at Bullworth. The beauty of that game was the size of the world they built felt compact but substantial, and they could do the same again on new hardware.

It's not like GTA, where I'm hoping for bigger cities, more land to explore, more types of transport. A Bully sequel could focus on a great story in a moderately sized town with amazing attention to detail and a variety of activities to try out.

I'm excited just talking about the concept. Kinda sorta...

>Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between Team Bondi and multiple Rockstar studios around the world.

 GTA V wasn't even remotely a full effort. I'm sure it was a lot of work but the script for GTA V was 3,500 pages. That was already done. All the dialogue was already recorded. The soundtrack was already done. The game world was already created. It was obviously not the same as making a full game from scratch. >  GTA V for next gen and PC was basically a full release and (according to them) it was a full effort.

I'm not going to deny this, but I think OP's point still stands. Even if it was a full effort, the effort was put towards bringing the game to more platforms with the same, and more, microtransactions. So if we cut out L.A. Noire, I'd be accurate in saying they've released 2 games for PC in the last 8 years, yes? I'm going to have a full release when they finally announce Red Dead 2 GTA V PC was developed along side Console. There was some extra work done, but not as much as you'd think.

http://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-talk-4k-pc-performance-and-more/
 Pokemon is 20 years old.  Fuck, I remember my first Rare Candy, people gathered around me with my Gameboy Pocket, I was cool.  I can't even name a single new pokemon now. I need a GTA where you can fly between 2 or 3 cities just so there's a plane hijacking mission. I hope that they will improve open world aspects. I felt that Mafia 2 had nothing to do in their "open world". I loved the game, but that thing bothered me a bit. I wish they would do the midwest,  plenty of locations to choose from that would allow for some decent satirization (or would it be parody?) 

GTA Houston/Chicago/Minneapolis&St.Paul?

All ripe for the picking https://gfycat.com/HonestFrighteningFritillarybutterfly Why would you buy it for ps4 if you got it on Pc?  Same here, but 360, PC, Xbone. The PS4 version is at 30Fps, you can tell the jitteriness. Mouse and keyboard for 1st person on PC makes it the best option for me.  If not for the vast graphical and performance improvements you get from the PC version, get it for the free online, the superior controller choice, and modability. I burnt myself out on it during the original release, but I bought the PC version and it was like a whole new game. Mods are seriously the shit. And here we all are bitching about No Man's Sky!  Casino! there *was* a stock market iirc but people just exploited it :/ GTAV: half life 3 expansion pack A couple months in an interview with IGN Rockstar said they had reassigned the entire GTA to the online mode due to its popularity. So they were working on offline DLC but it got put on the back burner indefinitely so thaey could focus more on online. This is the same reason why new online cars are no longer also offline. What really bugs me is not only did they flake out on delivering story DLC, they've completely abandoned story mode updates entirely now. New GTA Online vehicles aren't even added to story mode anymore. Honestly liked I better than nikos story. It was so much fun. Really wanted to play as different characters in a new story in gta 5 😢 I never played it, but bought Lost & Damned and loved it. I've heard Gay Tony is better, I just didn't do any research and bought it on an impulse  > Beat it in one sitting, couldn't put it down.

Hehe  "Thank god I still have hundreds of million from the early money glitch" would have been my response had I the intention of ever booting up this game again. Don't worry, I'm sure there will be a sale on Shark Cards™.


^^^^^^/s Yep all but stopped playing this game since my glitch money ran out.  I specifically remember this, there's even a building in game that looks like the shell of a casino that everyone was talking about. Crates and keys in r/RocketLeague for example.  > ~~developer~~ **studio**  
  
Fixed that for you. Please don't accuse developers themselves of making decisions like this. It rarely falls into our bucket in the decision tree. By the time we know about this stuff, it's being shoved into our sprint for us to finish by a deadline.   hats sorta implies that its something you don't need, or would have any impact on the game but you still want to buy it because you are a narcissistic shit (dota 2). I think what you mean is LoL LoL LoL, where core aspects of the game are locked behind either paywall or grindwall. Its basically just a bunch of screenshots from a GTA forum. Best I could find was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfETk8CTp9g&feature=youtu.be) shitty youtube video. If you dont feel like watching it this is it summed up:

Bikers

Luxury life (mansions and pets)

Law and Order (vigilante missions I think)

Hunting (which has animals for online)

And then after that, there's 2 paid DLCs

N. Yankton and Liberty city for sept 2017

Las Venturas and San fierro for oct. 2018
 [deleted] I miss the first ones on PS2 as well. Very arcade-y, made-up cars, nighttime only, and unlocking secret cars and finding secret areas for jumps and stuff. I'd play HD versions of those for sure. Then MC3: Dub Edition introduced real-life cars and and a level of cosmetic customization that was unrivaled at the time. Great series overall. For real, it was my favorite racing game by far. Mainly because it was like fast & furious put in a game (fast and furious movies might be a bit lame but the whole premise of illegal street racing in the first couple movies is awesome, also racing for pink slips is great fun). >they could possibly make it less popular for other companies to make it pay to play pretty much

Have you ever played GTA:Online ? Halo 5, rocket league, gta v. All great games being supported very with free dlc thanks to some harmless microtransactions. I hope more developers do this and stop charging us £5 for each piece of DLC, or £40 for a season pass Absolutely it is.   It's the only way to keep themselves staffed full time like this and is a pretty great way to keep qualified employees around.  The fine line they've been walking is keeping the shark cards from becoming pay-to-win.   I dont mind pay-to-have-nice-things as long as I can still kill the guy for *free*. I really like Fallout 4 graphics, but I hated FO3 graphics back when that came out. So Mafia? DUB Edition was the shit! Getting the PS2 out now to play. My 3 favourite racing games in order are


Road Rash - all versions 


Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition 


Burnout.


Guess which racing games don't get games unlike the dreadful ones. That Dub edition game for me kicked NFS's games at the time.  Unfortunately, I don't own an xbox. I  would love to play some of the exclusives for it.  New mafia game is on its way in case you weren't aware buddy :) That's exactly my point. It was a neat game it its own right, but it did not need nor benefit from the large, sandbox world in which it was set. That world was totally wasted on LA Noire. However, if they set GTA in that world, then you could really explore and use said world. I've never played the Mafia games, which I guess are somewhat in that vein, but GTA seems like a crazy natural fit for that world. Not really. Mafia 2 is very like LA Noire in that regard. A pretty world, but nothing to do beside the campaign. There are no side missions or activities or anything to do really, just some collectibles. And 48 of them are a car chase, a foot chase or a shootout. Yaaay, great content! There was no vice in vice city in the 40s / 50s. That didn't happen until late 70s / early 80s with the cocaine drug lords. As a matter of fact it wasn't even much of a city until cocaine money built it up. I loved the stealth gameplay of manhunt. If they don't do a sequel, I'd love for them to at least release a remastered version. They never said anything about this being the last one or a closer. I saw it as another MP game, immensely differnt but better. I've played through that game like 5 times, there's nothing like its quality of gun play. If you want a shoot em up, Max Payne 3 is still the solid answer.  Damn right it is. Max Payne 3 on PC still looks much better than 99 % of the games released this year and is decently optimised. 

Their physics engine (Euphoria) is still unrivaled as well for me.  I think he was referring to the NetImmerse engine that Morrowind ran on, that became Gamebryo for Oblivion/Fallout 3/NV, then the 'we promise we're doing an entire new' Creation Engine for Skyrim (hint: it wasn't 'entirely new') and refined further for Fallout 4.

The idTech stuff is a whole 'nother beast.

**EDIT:** Just found a neat reddit post here about the engines: https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/4os0fj/clearing_misconceptions_on_netimmerse_gamebryo/
 You *would think* that with each game rendition they'd just include features that were already present in their previous games.  

Like saying nice things to strangers, using a sword, taking on multiple opponents at once, dating people, hijacking trains, starting turf wars, etc.

You'd be wrong though :( Luckily the fine layer of cheeto that dust coated /u/Mallyveil like a soft winter's snow absorbed the tears of his anguish and also gave him something to dip his chips in. [deleted] Exactly what I was thinking. Bully doesn't need a gigantic city to explore, so you can throw so many small details in the game.

Bully was made before R* made their own game engine so it's awesome just thinking about the features they could add to a sequel now.  That team had been working on L.A. Noire for like 7 years though, it was the only game that studio ever produced.

And the reason they're defunct (if the rumors are to be believed) is because Rockstar had complete disdain for the way Team Bondi managed development. Weird There's also multiple subsets of Rockstar, such as Rockstar North, Rockstar San Diego, etc., and not all of them work on the same project. Also various files from lastgen releases basically proved that nextgen version was in plan from beginning Shhh, dont tell them. People still think a graphic overhaul is as hard as making a whole new game. this, the console versions were already developed on PC so basically every asset was already created and on a hard drive somewhere. Well yeah, the port took an absurdly long time so they had to say something by way of damage control.  Not like they'd say something like 'we phoned it in and only had two interns working on it' It's kind of nice to see a studio put effort into their ports though.  So many are done poorly that it's refreshing to see a company support a game for multiple years, across platforms, even if it is micro transaction based.  I think anybody who played GTA IV on a PC is glad Rockstar took their time with this port. IV had a ton of performance issues, heck, V ran better on the same system.  No, it would be three. Max Payne 3, GTA4 and GTAV  Red Dead 3* Lol, that happened back in 2009.  Red Dead Revolver was the first, Red Dead 2 was Red Dead Redemption. As long as they bring it to PC this time. Fuck. There's one called Durant, and I only know that because of Kevin Durant  There were quite a few plane hijacking missions in GTA San Andreas. You fly to Liberty City in San Andreas and kill people in a jet on the way there  It was like that in Mafia I as well. The free roaming during the storyline was usually just to go from mission to mission. There was a freeride mode though, but that was just messing around with cars and guns. Man, even if they never give us Chicago, at least let us give Las Venturas or San Fierro another whirl.

EDIT: Hell, Rockstar, we'll take Carcer City even from Manhunt. You never even showed us that whole place. One day there will be a game that remembers that Kansas City exists. > I did end up buying it 3 times because I'm an idiot... [deleted] Probably wanted to play with his friends in the PlayStation ecosystem. He did own it first on PS3 after all. Idk about him, but I first got ps3 on release, then got the ps4 version bundled with my ps4 and last of us, and then finally got it on PC I waited four hours for the midnight release of the PS3 version; I already knew it would break all sorts of records, and I just had to be part of the first people that got to play it. Even got a special T-Shirt from being first!

Then my little brother and I both got a PS4 in 2014, and I found that by buying it through his account and switching primary accounts between our PS4's (since I have PS+ and he doesn't), we could both play it on PS4 online for the price of one.

Then I build my PC a couple months ago, and I had to get the GTA V + Megalodon Shark Card combo for 50 euros. Haven't played it much yet, since I have a bunch of other games to work my way through and just started college, but still, one day... PS4 version came out before PC. He probably just screwed the order up.

That, or he has friends on PS4 he'd like to still play with.  Play with friends who own it on ps4? Because Xbox 360 I paid $60 & Xbone I paid $15. Why not buy it again at that price? I ended up with an xbone copy to play with friends while it was on sale What is wrong with you people.  GTA V lived up to the hype though. I was pissed I couldn't have a low rider because I don't like us multiplayer And the fact that you can't buy multiple properties. Even San Andreas had that. I'm only allowed to own a few cars in SP? Wtf am I supposed to do with the 1.2 billion dollars I have then? 

If SP DLC is abandoned, that would be some bullshit. The SP story is one of the best GTA campaigns yet.  I guess I'm one of the few that actually preferred Niko's story. 

Maybe I just empathize with it better by virtue of being a sad Slav in America.  It really is good.  I'm so annoyed that I missed out on that. I lost my money and Rockstar claims it never existed and won't give it back 😔  [removed] They took all of my glitched money away (which is fair enough), and I'm sure as shit not going to give them real life money to get some of it back. Is it out of the game? I'm still living on the 10 mil someone gave me back in the day cuz they thought I was a chick  Pretty sure there's a place for horse racing too right? Apologies, I am not really familiar with the nuances in terms. To me a developer is a studio but I can infer from your comment that they are very different. I know at least that a publisher is different to a developer? But how is a developer different to a studio?  The solution is not to buy into such things. Yea but, fuck that. Online is boring really, i quit playing right after heists went live. Everything they release is geared towards online, i dont give a fuck about money, i just want the content, in single player. You always see all this cool ahit in mp, but it feels like nothings changed for spm Ya know, I've spend 3 years looking at that stupid big black box under my TV wondering where the tapes went...I still don't know where! Midnight club 3 dub edition will be one of my top 5s for a looooong time. I remember Midnight Club 2 having a rocket car after you won the game. The thing went like 300mph I'm Tokyo, thay was a blast. Did you ever play MC3 online? I have stated a project to try and improve the PC port of Midnight Club 2 called [OpenMC2](https://github.com/LRFLEW/OpenMC2). It requires the game data from the PC version of MC2 (I recommend [getting it off of Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/12160/)), but the goal of the project is to improve compatibility with newer versions of Windows, and to fix a number of persistent bugs (such as broken controller support and crashes). It's still **VERY** early in the project's development, but [there is a working build at this point](https://github.com/LRFLEW/OpenMC2/releases/tag/v0.0.1). It may not be an "HD Version", but there are some planned features like anti-aliasing, better widescreen, and high-resolution support, and mod support (to allow for things like community-made HD texture packs) that will make it similar to one. GTA:O is pay to play? Huh that's news to me, I use two characters regularly and have just over $60 million. It's a fun game and I haven't paid for anything but the $35 dollar game on sale. You need to make friends and have a crew to make it worth while so you can make big money. House real BIG, cars real BIG... Forza Horizon 3 is coming out for PC aswell! If you have a PC, it's also coming to the Windows Store with the Xbox Play Anywhere program. If its anything like the last then you don't really get GTA 1940. You are always cruising around in a mission or stuff Something I would actually like to see, and which would make good business sense, would be for them to reuse the world that was already created--the assets are hopefully saved somewhere--and then build a "new" game inside it. Could be another LA Noir style of game, something totally GTA, or somewhere in between. 

I actually think this could be done for a number of games. Far Cry kinda of did that. And I don't think it's a bad thing. Stuff needs to be set in different places, some of the cosmetics of the land changed up to suit the theme of the game, but if it's not an attempt to "cheat" but rather to openly admit, yeah, this *was* the same place, it could be neat to see it in a different light with different things and be surprised by areas you thought were safe before now be dangerous or vice versa.

Of course, I say this, but the last thing I'd want would be for all the AAA developers to just reuse the same geography for several games going forward. A neat idea to use in *moderation* publishers/developers! Honestly Mafia wasted the world as well Run, drive, shoot... What else has there ever been in a GTA game?  Yes, there's usually been some flying, but aside from the scripted storytelling component, every mission in every GTA game ever has always been about navigating from one waypoint to the next, either in a vehicle or on foot, killing people along the way.  

They mix it up with some twists-- Sometimes there's multiple waypoints that you can visit out of order, sometimes the waypoints are moving, sometimes there's a time limit, and sometimes it's just the killing.  You also have the cop evasion/runaway component, but ultimately everything is just a combination of these ingredients.

The game propels the player through these repetitive combinations using storytelling, and the end result is fantastically well-made, but that's the game.

You might as well complain that [insert first-person shooter here] is "nothing but a bunch of shootouts.  Yaaay, great content!" I forgot all about swords! To be fair, the machete gets you almost there. Especially in FPV.  Why the disdain? Was that the result or the cause of the 7 year development period?  Really? That's odd. Do you know where I can read more about that? Or that they would say the real reason of "We wanted to release this pc port during one of our weaker release quarters to shore up quarterly profits for our investors" Ah yes, the eternal cycle.

> Why is this port shit?

vs

> Why did it take them so long to make this port? GTA4 would be the 8 year ago point I'm measuring from. That Pokemon is from Generation 5, and we're less than 2 months away from Generation 7.  There have been 3 (about to be 4) main series releases since that Pokemon was added; Black 2 and White 2, X and Y, and the Generation 3 remakes.  Pokemon Sun and Moon, the first Generation 7 games, are releasing in November, and they look dope. Probably not tho.  But why male models? [deleted] I need help I honestly cannot fathom this shit, now /u/PM-ME-YOUR-DOGPICS if you go to a gaming post and say "i sometimes pre order games" watch how many of these same people here will downvote you and tell you you're an idiot who is wasying his money.

Smh 360 and PC can be justified though.

360 was 2013, when it first came out.

I bought it then cuz I had 60 bucks to spend and I wanted to play a great game.

2 years later, it came to PC and I wanted to experience said great game again with 1440p 100fps.

So I bought it again.
 And delivered even more. First person gta? How cool is that?? The single player mode is incredible. GTA Online was a steaming turd for ages though. I wish they'd have left it as is to work on DLC, but I guess DLC doesn't print money like micro transactions do Most of the hype* I could make a page long list of bad things in gta V but the crazy thing is that despite all that its still an amazing game that i play all the time. I thought that Gay Tony was awesome and The Lost and Damned was alright, I just couldn't help but to come back to Niko's story, it felt like a Scorsese movie.

Niko's story made you really feel as if you were in this city for months and running into endless problems. 
His story took the American Dream to task showing how difficult it is to get away from crime or run away from your past. 

Sorry, I really like GTA 4.  You can have my chrome forklift if you want. I'm annoyed that the online game is basically unplayable for those of us who missed out  Do you play on pc or ps4? Same here. Only large amount of money I've gotten was from pre-ordering it on PC. Didn't play online enough when I had it on 360. Story mode was just too good. That was awesome.. Got various 'gifts' adding up to 2,5 billion (!). After a couple days of total GTAO anarchy Rockstar took the money back. Could keep all my online purchases though. They did the exact same thing to me. That's when I pretty much stopped playing.  Google Pacific Standard heist glitch. Not that I would know anything about that.  Im gonna say about 25 percent of the lobbies I join have a hacker that tears shit up and spawns everyone money. Shouldn't be too hard Hobestly, I just payed some 10 year old a couple bucks to put a ton of money on my account. It was pretty weird process, but it worked. A developer is a job title for an individual. Calling a studio a "developer" is sort of like calling Nissan an engineer or Scripps a Doctor.  
And developers rarely get a say in how things are going to be, we only get a say (and even then it's rare) in technical implementation of the design that was already approved and finalized.  
Things like micro transactions, DLC being pay to play or not are decisions made way higher up the food chain than the developers themselves.  
I understand that people have been calling studios "game developers" for years, but it's been inaccurate for years and I'm just doing my part, as a software developer myself, to correct this inaccuracy. I've had to work on a popular product as a developer and decisions were made that I wouldn't have made, had my suggestions and feedback been taken more seriously. Seeing people criticize that product and say "what were the developers thinking" or "those developers are assholes" bothers me because I want to be proud of everything I build, but managers usually barricade us from doing things the way *we* would do them.  
This is why I admire companies like Rockstar, Naughty Dog and CD Projekt RED. Their management has a very strong connection with their engineers and it shows in their products.  They're next to your betamax tapes, miniDiscs, and HDDVD's. House real big cars real big everything real big. ANTE UP! And the cheat code where you could shoot rockets and bullets! No, I never got onto online gaming until the Xbox 360 came out. It has less to do with you or me not spending money and more to do with all the people who DID spend money. Belly real BIG! Still need Windows 10, and have to deal with UWP as well  Does the new one take place in the 60's? Pretty sure I saw some muscle cars of the ads for it. Still a story based game, but you do get full free roam.  All side activities count toward story progress.  So it's not like I or II, where you are always in a mission.  Game takes place in 68 in Louisiana, more about downfall of the Italian mob and the rise of other criminal organizations, like your own. > moderation

You see that is where the problem lies, most corporate offices don't get that part, they just green-light the things they know will sell and don't care about fine-tuning it to match consumer dreams.  I wish they would combine LA Noire and True Crime. Sleeping Dogs was fucking excellent, and doing basically the same thing but with more detective features and set in 1940 gangster paradise would be so sweet.  Man the melee combat in GTA is weak these days. 

Realistic - but weak, so weak This was a while back, but I believe Team Bondi had its employees working terribly long hours for shit pay.

Edit: Grammar [deleted] There are a lot of reports of awful workplace environments, requiring workers to put in longer than even the usual long workdays, verbal abuse, no support, etc. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Bondi?wprov=sfla1

Apparently there was a some shady shit going on with the management.  From all reports, this Team Bondi boss McNamarra sounds like Cave Johnson without the humor and results. http://www.develop-online.net/news/industry-outrage-at-brutal-team-bondi-crunch/0109678

Have a read. It was pretty brutal even for game making standards In addition to what others have posted there were rumours about credits. Apparently if you worked on the game, even for years, but left the company before the game shipped, your name was left out of the credits. not op but found this

http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/24/why-did-la-noire-take-seven-years-to-make

This was echoed by a gameplay programmer, who had no prior game development experience. "They have a massive turnover; a huge attrition rate," he says. "I remember sitting in a meeting with all of the gameplay programmers. There were around 20 of us at the time. I looked around, and realised that out of all of them, other than the team lead, I'd been there the longest. And I'd only been there for under 12 months."

Pretty good read Weird I don't know how comprehensive you'd like but [this is a story](http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/24/why-did-la-noire-take-seven-years-to-make) about the development of LA Noire and how it was such a mess Do you consider *Episodes From Liberty City* a separate release?

Also, I can't believe that they never did *RDR* on the pc. Wasn't it some nonsense like *Heists* production took people away from the port project or something? So how many Pokémon are there now? I'm assuming it's way past the 151 ... are you serious? i just told you a moment ago. I will help you.  Just send $100 to 

Mr. Happy

123 Fake St.

Illinois You could get your corpus callosum severed. Then both hemispheres of your brain can independently check if what you're about to do is stupid. This is one I just don't get. I see zero appeal in playing GTA first person. I generally prefer 3rd person games anyways, but I do enjoy an FPS. GTA is meant to be 3rd person to me.  Perfect description. The mobster Scorsese feel of it was amazing and the main reason I loved the game. I really hope the next GTA is in Liberty City again or a Chicago type city just because I want another mafia connection in the story. > The Lost and Damned was alright,

Warning! - Opinions: 

TLaD was one of the worst games I've ever played, story-wise. It felt horrible, nitty-gritty, dark, humourless (because what jokes there were fell flat), and above all else the culture represented within is genuinely repulsive. 

BoGT was, in contrast, one of the most excellent games I played that year, and I loved it.  Say what? Lul Wut. Pics?  But it's *not* unplayable. All you have to do is buy some Shark Cards..











/s PC. Even that is slow in my opinion. Is it some 300k per complete, with loadtimes that's maybe twice an hour. So to get a car you only need to grind couple hours, yei, thrilling.

Fuck grinding in a GTA game. MiniDisc...holly shit!

I remember them, when I was in high school I really wanted one but my parents wouldn't get me one. I found out someone I was friends with had one (his dad bought him all the latest tech (we're talking mid 90's to 2000's tech) he let me borrow it to show to my parents.

I ended up dropping it and it broke, well, my parents bought one, but it wasn't for me! Never did get one in the end! BELLY REAL BIG That cheat, and the unlock all cars cheat was the shit. Me and my little bro spent far too much time just driving around and going into the Paris Catacombs and LA canal. (Clap on) Lights when you get an affection

(Clap on) lights so you can find some protection... Yeah, you are a Vietnam vet. It fucking sucks man, the characters fight like bitches and if you really nees to win a fight just sprint around in circles and keep using the stunning forward dash 2x damage unblockable haymaker. Melee combat was one of my favorite things in GTA. I think it peaked at GTA 4 Nah, it wasn't because of the pay or hours. The boss (Brendan McNamarra) was a complete douchebucket. He had absolutely no respect for anyone, especially coders. In fact, he told us that every last one of us was completely replaceable in 4 weeks. During the first 3 years, we went through 24 coders, on a team of 18. Only 3 of them "got fired", the rest quit because unemployment was better than staying there - some even had to leave the country within 4 weeks because of work visas.

The guy is a total tool.

It could also be that rockstar dropped TB (Team Bondi / Team Bondage / Tuberculosis) because Brendan threw a chair at the producers - but I wasn't there for that part, so, may not be true, but I totally believe it given how he acted the rest of the time... You could be talking about almost any development studio. I think it was more due to Brendan McNamara being a toxic asshole to everybody he had contact with, including Rockstar. He basically single-handedly blacklisted himself and ruined Team Bondi after Rockstar had enough of his shit, finished the game, kept the rights to the IP, and severed all ties. Some of the Team Bondi devs were assimilated into Rockstar as well. > This was a while back, but I believe Team Bondi had it's employees working terribly long hours for shit pay.

Uh, that's Rockstar San Diego, too! Look, if you start letting developers leave their desks they might develop hobbies, lives outside of work, families, and other major productivity-killers.  It's basically like stealing from the company. Quote from the Team Bondi studio head on the [wikipedia page of Team Bondi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Bondi):

> "It was a long, painful process, but making games is like making films in that it’s a marathon, not a sprint – and some people come into the process not knowing that. I’d love to spend more time at home with my family and kids. We run things differently now – we have flexi-hours, for example. But everybody has their view on who’s the worst boss in the world, and maybe that’s me. I’ve read some amazing things about Steve Jobs in his biography, and I’ve never seen him get as vilified any way as much as I have. Sam Peckinpah [’70s film director] fired [plenty of] people off one movie, and nobody said a thing. Werner Herzog pulled a gun on Klaus Kinski to get him to finish a movie! Obviously I don’t compare myself to any of those people…"

The last line is gold. Obviously he doesn't even though he just did. Wow. If true that's really bad. Surprised people just didn't walk As well because they paid their coders $35k-40k a year and treated them like shit. To put that wage in perspective, I was a bricklayer in Aus in the late 2000s, and our labourers would earn significantly more than that on a 40 hour week, TB coders were doing 70.

Fair play to them for even sticking around a month, let alone getting close to a year.  They said the code is such a mess that it is a miracle it runs in the first place and that porting it would be near impossible without remaking it from the ground up. I would rate Episodes from Liberty City just under a full game.  The two DLC packs added a ton of content, but the world was already there, as were much of the ambient dialog and sounds.  TL;DR: Yes.

In full, there were 721 Pokemon in the Pokedex for the last games.  Full details of the Gen 7 Pokemon are still unknown, but at least 45 new Pokemon have been revealed.

Keep in mind that many Pokemon have multiple forms and Mega Evolutions that do not apply to this count, which started in Generation 2, with the Pokemon Unown having a form that corresponds to all 26 letters in the American alphabet; two more were added later, corresponding to the exclamation mark and question mark. I love knowing that this line was improvised by Duchovny. Apparently Stiller forgot his line or just wanted to start the scene from the top, but instead of Duchovny going with it he ad-libbed the best line in the movie. Hey Miles, it's me, Miles. How can she slap? But R* took all of my money :( I pretty much always play in third person, but some things just look so great in first person. Either way I'm very glad it's an option and I use it a bit. Actually like shootouts better in first person too. The good thing about FPS mode for me is that it allows for the GTA Vive mod to work easier, making for a more immersive experience. I feel like the true first person aspect of it really changes the game and ups the adrenaline running away from cops and getting into gun fights. Playing GTA in first person just made me want a crime simulator with more realistic gunplay. It's not really better, but it's a fun gimmick to me. Playing in 3rd person I don't really mind hitting pedestrians, but the first time I did it in first person I actually winced.  Next gta should be in London again Most likely just a joke. Chrome was popular with the skiddie type that would spawn tons of money and/or fuck up a lobby for no reason. They'd have garages full of nothing but chrome cars.

Theoretically you could just spawn in a forklift and hack paint it chrome but you wouldn't be able to save it. I don't think this is what they were talking about though.

TL;DR it was a joke. Hey, you don't have to buy them. All you have to do is spend an entire week of playing every waking hour to get a few million to get maybe 30% of the customizations you want for a single car. It's not *that* big a deal you guys. I mean, I *only* payed $60 for this game, what's another few years of my life to basically get nowhere in it? sure just giver me your credit card number and pin /s Pc is blessed with free money lobbies if you just look around for a bit. do it yourself and have the pleasure of a 7 day ban(Maybe it was a month, I am not quite sure). A friend of mine did it. Worth it, he even got to keep his money after he got unbanned lmao. Dang it if was ps4 I could hook you up. Same for anyone reading this pm me


Came back to like 20 messages. I'll get the first few people. I'm sure I'll get removed but it's cheating flat and simple. If your not into that then I wont.


I would need account info for an account to mod on gta. Basically I have a molded copy of the newest patch on ps3 and I just log into you on that user and rank you up to 420 and max your money. I am only doing the first few because I have to factory reset my ps3 each time I do it. I'm not sure if it still works but a few months ago you could edit the multiplier for winnings on races with cheat engine and you could get 8 million per race. There's a glitch for receiving all the cash (1.250.000 gta dollars) at the end of the Pacific Standard heist. That pretty much gives you the money to buy it all.

At least makes the grind less of a drag.. you could always just find shit to do and enjoy it instead Ya good memories with those. 

I bought one, imported from Japan, from this dude's small webpage. If I recall correctly we was a flight attendant and would import them as a side business. 

The minidisc recorder was like $450 or something crazy but it did excel for recording. Long after the technology failed I still used it to record bootlegs at concerts and some other audio projects at school and in film. Before Napster (think like a 6 month or 1 year window for me when I bought it) I even used it record audio from MTV, which seems so ridiculous now (yeah they use to play a lot of music back then).  It was *revolutionary* in 4. Then they realised that most of their players are kids who need it simple.  If you worked at Team Bondi while LA Noire was being produced, I can't help but tell you that this was one of my favorite games of all time. The atmosphere was perfect, I loved interviewing suspects, the characters were diverse and accurate, just everything was awesome. I don't know which part you may have been responsible for, but thank you for helping to make such an amazing under-appreciated game. My brother in law had a job interview there back in 08/09 when they were looking for animators. Kinda glad he didn't get the job after hearing about all that went on.  Do you know a john c. With a Scottish accent Ay yo, sorry your boss was a tool. It didn't show in your work. L.A. Noire was a stellar game. I thought I had beaten the entire game after the homicide desk because the story to the homicide desk was SO  intense. Holy shit, you worked at Team Bondi? I know you're probably getting a lot of this, but LA Noire is easily one of my 3 favorite games between this gen and last. If you really did work there, thank you for everything you and your colleagues did. Although you have evidently suffered much, please take solace in knowing that you helped bring us a truly magnificent videogame. Thank you for elevating the genre, and for somehow protecting the masterpiece from that maniac. It may seem like it, but good studios will pay you well and not expect you to work long hours, but you will want to stay overtime. True, good on Rockstar for cutting ties with that toxic company. Apparently toward the beginning of development, they were considering bringing Team Bondi in as Rockstar AU or something. Eagle Jump seems to take good care of its employees, actually Yeah that's the argument and it's really stupid because then your workers are unhappy which is probably the single biggest productivity factor Also some bad examples. Steve Jobs in particular go so much flak for his management style that he was fired from the company be founded. He was different when he came back; still ruthless, but in different ways (like colluding wirh other tech companies to prevent bidding wars for employees). 

Also, you made LA Noire, Steve Jobs made the iPhone and the Macintosh. It's not hard to see why some people give Jobs a wider berth.  In an article I read a while back, it mentioned that many people did leave. Some simply just quit and their names weren't included on the credits. There was a big blow up about that, too. 

Here we go: http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-03-100-staff-cut-from-la-noire-credits You can see it in the girls face (I don't remember her name) that's she's like "fucking seriously Ben?" 



And it's funnier when you learn that they're married 




Edit: the girl is Christine Taylor, and apparently Maury Ballstein (would he be considered Zoolander's agent?) is Stiller's father lol did you know steve buscemi was a firefighter? Hey_im_miles! The first time I played in first person it blew my mind. It was a completely different perspective on the world I previously only knew in 3rd person. Everything I did (driving, firefights, ect) felt fresh and new. It almost felt like an entirely new game. It probably also helped that I was high and it was my first time playing on PC from the Xbox 360 lol Seattle would be good if you included all the trade connections to Japan and somehow worked in the Yakuza Did you just write a tl;dr for 5 sentences? Why should it be any different in an economy-based game? Doesn't it make sense that the more you play (or spend), the more goods you will have?

And clearly most people are not struggling to get nice cars and upgrades and all that.  Well I guess I have very bad luck then. I swear everytime I play they only mess with me. Well, the might take my money, but they will never take my 3 garages full of chrome super cars! My brother got a 10 day ban recently and they took his money. We're still not sure what he did to deserve the ban, but oh well. Wait...MTV played music...I'm calling bullshit on this(!) You're right...that's why they made they default auto aim too. Reverting back to gta 3 style. Yeah fantastic game. I used it a few times to distract myself during opiate withdrawal, the atmosphere and story is so rich that I'd often forget about my pain and cravings because I was so absorbed. And I had already completely finished (and loved) the game before those times.

Oblivion and New Vegas (my 2 favourite games) were decent for the same purpose, but LA Noire was just perfect for it. Thank you for someone saying this, my all time favourite game. ^Ditto, it was an amazing game to me. I wish I would have bought the game of the year or whatever edition to play all the dlc. I bought it in 2014, real late in its cycle after a friend, God rest his soul, had recommended it. 

I enjoyed it, given that it was something completely different and actually took thought to play. Yeah, dodged a bullet - but animators were much more loved, especially since Brendan's "baby" was not LANoire or TB, but Depth Analysis, the facial animation system. Yeah but deadlines are deadlines. Even good studios are like YOU'RE COMING TO WORK AND STAYING when that shit gets close. Cuz it's everyone's ass.  I do believe they hired a bunch of the LA Noire developers after the studio shut down. Don't let these "industry insiders" bullshit you. All game developers treat their employees like dog shit on the bottom of your shoe. Just some guys like Brendan McNamarra take it one step further so the executives and producers act like he is a monster while the rest of them are still horrible work environments. 

All companies that hire coders that work in any sort of entertainment industry are very bad places to work even the ones who pay a decent salary. The entertainment industry would outsource all coders to other companies if they could get away with it. The only problem is these third party contractors treat the entertainment companies pretty badly so the big companies need to keep at least a shell of a coding staff on hand.

Artists actually get treated really well compared to coders in entertainment even making more in a lot of cases. 

If you are a good coder go into anything but gaming/entertainment unless you are only going to do it to start your own contracting company and take the big entertainment conglomerates for all their worth. Kim Jong Un disagrees and all North Koreas econimic data suggests otherwise. Before their passing, Stiller's parents were in all or almost all of his movies in at least a cameo capacity.  When he started going out with Taylor or when he married her, she joined in for the same. Have you played GTA V... On weed, man? And weird ass civilian NPCs. That is the only city I've ever seen a person walk another person(who was in a gimp suit) on a leash like a fucking dog. I looked around to see if anybody else was gawking but they walked by like it was perfectly normal. Yeah I think he did. 

Tl;dr Agreed with you.  I work in IT. I'm pretty much conditioned to consider it fact that nobody reads past the first 2 sentences, so yeah, I applied similar logic here.
 Haha exactly, gotta store the cash you give yourself in supercars, all the boats, helicopters, bikes, busses etc. you can get. Holy shit! Look at all that leg room. The guy in the back looks like he is playing a synthesizer Lemme tell ya. That is exactly how it happens. I played both Borderlands, and all three Mass Effects while deployed by playing at night off the side of a trailer. Thanks for posting my picture. I'm glad it's getting more visibility. This was about a 10 hour flight and they played for a couple hours. It was pretty inventive.  We had a seal team on our ship on my first deployment. Cool guys. Helped them clear out and set up their berthing. Carried their black cases in the room and they opened them up. Two self contained 32 HDTVs with a 360 in one case and a PS3 in the other. They started playing asap. Pretty sweet setup, just open and plug in one thing and you're good to go. This is like a McDonald's employee playing Burger Time. Just curious, are you Air Force? Fucking Air Force always gets the nice stuff.

EDIT: Holy hell, first time I have been gilded, and for good old fashioned interservice rivalry? Why thank you! (And it is almost my birthday, too!) *migrating servers* This looks very similar to one of the safehouses in a 'Call of Duty : Black Ops 3' singleplayer mission.

Edit: [Found a link](https://charlieintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-10-05-at-2.36.20-PM.png)  Shit, I never had that on any of my C-17 flights. Just an MRAP chained down in front of me that bounced so hard with the turbulence, I was surprised it had any suspension left Lucky guys.  Everytime I was on a C-130, C-17, or a C-5 they had us packed in there to max capacity. "Fckin noobs" Easier to find a way when you have a projector. Interesting choice of game, you would think that would be the last thing they want to play.  
Edit: missed a word Alright boys let move out! We're in the c-17 tonight! Make sure you have your fucking synthesizers, keytars and Xbox packed! Shit will be lit Fucking C-17s...I hated working on that jet . So now let's get a pic of infantrymen playing a flight sim in the field. leg room for days... I got to fly in one of these a while back and we had to sit nuts to butts for most of the trip. 

I mean, we didn't *have* to. It was just more fun that way. [Relevant](http://i.imgur.com/HfdyDFO.jpg) Is that a C-17? Now imagine how easy with nintendo switch! ITT: That's a c-17 I'm more impressed that people still play Advanced Warfare. Missed opportunity to stage the Death from Above level for Modern Warfare. Is that stevo? [deleted] Out of all games why advanced warfare The guy DJ'ing in the back integrates his music with the bombs he drops What kind of projector is being used? Half expecting Old Snake and Otacon to be there C-17 flight crew here... turbulence will turn all of those toys into projectiles!!!! Looks fun though:) This is the most Call of Duty someone can ever be. FYI to folks who are wondering: This game is "COD: Advance Warfare", and it's awesome. Haters like to hate. Is the guy in the background a DJ? That's got Ali-Al-Salem to Leipzig wrote all over it.  God damn Air Force and their exceptional quality of life... Look at all the leg room guys!! Quick pack in all the Mountain Dew and Doritos you can!!!!  Carrying the leg room that United has taken out of their airplanes. That's now how I remember my C-130 rides... DJ in the background dropping the sick beats! Looks a shitload more comfortable than any commercial flight I've been on :) Man what the shit.

For the flight from Ft Hood to Kuwait, some 300 of us were crammed into tiny economy seats on a chartered commercial airliner for 21 hours, including a 1 hour stop in Shannon Ireland for refueling.

Then when we got to Kuwait, exhausted, hungry, and smelling to high heaven, it was time for us to unload all the bags because they sure as fuck didn't have their own baggage handlers.

Then we spent two weeks cooking in the Kuwaiti heat while we waited for General Whoever to sign our orders permitting us to enter Iraq.

At that point I loaded up in a C-130 and had some dude's knee in my balls for hours before we had to put down in Balad for emergency repairs.  

At no point was any thought given to the comfort of we troops.  We were just cargo that needed to piss and shit occasionally. Finally, my tax dollars are being put to good use :) Is that a fucking DJ in the background? I need to join the military... They even have a DJ.... Nice This is like a farmer playing farming simulator when he's on break. They don't call em the "Chair Force" for nothing..... I can only imagine the kind of trash talk these guys hear on Live serious question, how do they get power? I imagine people in the army playing like The sims and stuff Is that Advanced Warfare? Must have been a *really* long flight. There's so much room for activities. Must be next to an emergency exit When we fly on the 17s, we hook hammocks onto the pallets that we transport. Makes those overseas flights so much better. If we don't have hammocks, we bring those camping mats and sleeping bags so we still get to lay down. It's awesome and makes commercial flights suck now.  [deleted] DJ Airman droppin' beats like he droppin' bombs Why don't I use the sound of the synthesizer? ... Which *is* the sound of the future... It's Major Lazer, reporting for duty! De sintesizer?  [Serious] I'm guessing that he's the loadmaster and he's ensuring the cargo is secure. He's prepping for [first contact with aliens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWkj_3a3-4g).  He looks like he's about to start directing people out of the plane. Guys playing the game just don't care.  Wait is this how slow real military life is? Like how much time do you get to yourself? Don't forget pre sequel :( What kind of headphones are y'all using? They didn't even change the title! Wow that is frustrating Is there a standard plug in to power a projector and game console?  But, I took this picture You are my hero. For alot of reasons It's the seals, pros at everything. Seal Team 360? or better yet, a burger king employee > This is like a McDonald's employee playing Sneak King....

FTFY.

 Probably, looks like they're in a C-17 judging by the picture. If you're asking OP, I'm about 99.9% sure OP had nothing to do with the image.  It cropped up on r/funny ages ago, among other places (perhaps here or r/games as well), and it wasn't posted by this OP. Thought i was on /r/Airforce for a second This isn't OPs picture, but it is Air Force personnel on that plane.  It's a repost. OP stole and reposted a pic without even changing the title, so he isn't anything. Nah, just the flyers. The rest of the AF gets shat upon thoroughly, especially Cops, Maintainers, Services, and CE. Flyers get pampered like fuck and then bitch they were in the air for 12 hours doing goddamn nothing (except for the pilot of course).

Edit: a salty enlisted flyer PM'd me over this comment telling me I am wrong, I just wanted to share that information. >migrating host

FTFY Oh shit! I see it now!! Yep, like the Singapore safehouse! Depending on what year you took that flight it might not have had one. I remember in Iraq 2009 I drove MRAP's that didn't have suspensions and was told that it was because it would be cheaper to put it back together when we got blown up. By 2011 the started to put suspension systems on them.  You mean those "seats" weren't comfy? And I ain't talkin about the jump seats! At least I had leg room sitting in those! *n00bz 

Get it right It's the game that made them want to join to begin with. What did you expect?  Minecraft? Yeah but someone said they were air force so I mean it makes sense, they want to see some action too. You know what? Your getting some flak from your comment but I agree with you. I manage restaurants and spent a lot of time as head cook. I would rather throw away my gaming supplies than be forced to play a game based on cooking or restaurant work. However I can also see the point of military playing military games if they don't see combat. That's the exciting part of the job that they don't get to do. My buddy served in Afghanistan and Iraq, then went to work for Blackwater and did deployments (for back of a better word) for several years.

When he was back between jobs we'd play COD non-stop. 'Working on' as in 'on board' or as in 'performing maintenance and repairs on'? [deleted] Ha! Try going from C-5s to C-17s! I love the 17 way more than 5s Yep. The crown jewel of the Air Force  It was (and still is) a fun game to play online from time to time. Or the Iron Lady mission from MW3 Yo, dawg, I heard you liked warfare, so I put advanced warfare into your contemporary warfare, so you can shoot people while on your way to shoot people. Via a socket in the wall...just like in all the planes. Economy class might not have them though...
Or like you could get electricity out of your car when it's running. If you look closely, you might see it. I think the entire plane is the emergency exit.... for bombs.

Edit: [bomb cargo](http://www.skytamer.com/1.2/2008/8013.jpg) The hammock is the preferred option since the floor heat never works and even with the floor heat there's always a pocket of cold air between the floor and a couple feet above it. I flew on C-130s. First time I hung up a hammock was the best flight and best dream I've ever had in my life. I was deep in serenity. In my head, I followed that up with the obnoxious air horn, "BWOMP, BWOMP, BWOMP!!" DJ Airman van Buuren "Listen to this beat"

**hits buttons, no sound*

"Shit" > DJ Airman droppin' beats ~~like~~ when he droppin' bombs

 DJ Loadmaster, droppin' ***LOADS***!

Wait...😮 More rhymes than the bible's got psalms. My name is Giovanni Georgio... But everybody calls me..Georgio. de synthe*size*r I can't read the word "synthesiser" without Giorgio's accent anymore! ayyyyyyyy ahaaaaa, this guy!
 Is the sound of the future! Thank you for sharing! I imagine there are various jobs to do during the flight. I appreciate you giving some insight. You are correct Colbert did become president after all! [Kids these days, I fucking swear to god...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5ey_pSRBV0) a lot of time but not THAT much. u can play the entire mass effect trilogy but u still wont have enough time to play the half life trilogy Depends when and where you're deployed. 

My cousin-in-law just got back from assignment in Qatar and he said they literally did jack shit half the time he was there. Although he is Air Force medical, so who knows how much he has to do normally anyway.  99% everything else, 1% pants-shitting combat.

^ That's the ratio that I've been told (and confirmed by) ex-military who've been deployed. Can be. I've Deployed twice running commuications. Aside from daily upkeep, one everything is running you really are only there to fix it when it breaks.  Fill the generators, do whatever detail you might be on. Sit around playing games or schoolwotk or whatever youbdo to kerp occupied.

Edit: Correcting Numerous Typos (Stupid Phone)
>Can be. I've Deployed twice running communications. Aside from daily upkeep, once everything is running you really are only there to fix it when it breaks.  Fill the generators, do whatever detail you might be on. Sit around playing games or schoolwork or whatever you do to keep occupied. Where do you think "hurry up and wait" comes from? Hell, half of boot is standing in line. Basically all you have is work. Going to the gym and sleeping. 

When I was deployed you had a 12 hour shift did an hour or so of pt and then the rest was yours ( mostly )   one of our stations was pretty much monitoring a radio an using a camera to over watch as requested. Rest of the time was spent playing pc games with the person you were on shift with so you would stay awake. Or watching movies. What ever.  When I was deployed to Afghanistan, we were doing convoy trains literally 3 days at a time with 14-36 hours in between trains. With training,maintenance, classes and convoy prep for our next run, we had roughly 12 hour spread of "Our Time". Plenty of time to game or watch a few movie.

I mean, it's not like we're constantly in the shit. No, I'm a former infantryman and I had about 1full hour a day to piss, Shave, shit, shower and eat. The rest of the time I was either waliking, chugging ripits to stay awake, smoking cigarettes and trying to overcome heat exhaustion. Don't think it's all like this. I was having a good day if I got to eat and didn't have to piss in a bottle while driving or shit in an MRE bag in the back of my Bradley.  Hugely dependent on your job (AFSC in Air Force Speak).

There are many jobs that are very close to working a normal civilian job.  9-5, every weekend off and hardly ever deploy.

However, talk to anyone in aircraft maintenance, and they will have a very different story to tell.

Source - I was an active duty maintainer for 10 years. It all depends on when/where you go and what your job is and branch. You can get lucky (or unlucky depending on how you look at it) with a situation like this but most of the time it's something very different.  Wasn't out in 2012. Borderlands 2 wasn't even out until the end of my time there. I ordered it from Gamestop to be sent to a mail drop at an embassy, to the local base, to finally get sent to me.

They still haven't shown up. Amazon got it to me six business days later. Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones. 

Pretty much everyone I've met who works on military jets has these headphones, because of the active noise cancellation (passenger airliner jets have loads of noise dampening and insulation to keep the cabin quiet, military jets have barely any, so they are loads louder). looks like bose Nose quiet comfort noise cancelling headphones, I swear by them, totally blocks out airplane noise

Edit: forgot brand, Bose  i agree with the other guy, bose active noise canceling.  can be good for quieting loud consistent noises. You took this?  Fuckin' amateures at drowning.  C-17 hydraulics specialist here. Can confirm is C-17 Do Army personnel fly in C-17's too or nah? KC-10A Crew Chief here can confirm it's not a KC10 You can tell it's a C-17 because of the way it is He's not. He's reposting content to gain karma, judging by his submissions.

I'm still up voting because it's good content and karma is meaningless  yep, someone else commented above in a chain that it was their picture and had posted it an year ago, with the same title... No mention of failing mock PT tests or DFAC tendies, couldn't be r/airforce Remember comm. Or at least our contractors. Hehe, one of my buddies is a cop in the AF. He said it's pretty boring (he hasn't been stationed outside the US yet though).  AF guy here. Even with a cozy desk job i hated it. Glad to be on terminal leave right now.  Can confirm. I'm CE. "Except for the pilot" - had all four come down to the cargo bay one time crossing the Atlantic on a C17. They didn't seem too worried about it like we were. Retraining from services to load; can confirm.  Let's be real. Air Force has it the easiest out of all the branches. There really isn't much to debate on the topic. I'm not saying its even a bad thing. It's just the way it is. I used to be an FCC on C5's. I woke up once halfway through a long flight. 

The engineer was asleep, two pilots were racked out in the bunks, left seat was kicked back reading the paper. Loads were cooking and playing cards at the table. 

Flying was great. Nothing like the rest of the air force.  CE here, can confirm.  Don't go towards the light man! Gotta love how dark the military can be. Those things must've driven like a block of cement We had the maxxpro plus mraps in 2009, they had suspension in there but it was riding completely bottomed out due to all the extra weight. Nothing like doing 70mph down Irish in a 70,000 pound dump truck with essentially a safe on the back lol. I swear you could have towed a house with those things though. Depends on what generation he was from.  In the Vietnam war "newbie" was a pretty common term, and it was later adopted by the Doom community to distinguish experienced players from those new to videogames.  Circa 1996 this was shortened to "noobs" by the Quake movement.  1337 arose during the Counter Strike mod days, shifting to n00b and so on, but it wasn't until the Halo epoch that n00bz really came into its own, both commercially and artistically. In basic training 'how do u quick scope' See, I had the opposite effect. All games ever taught me about fighting is that you can do everything right and still get shot in the back of the head by some punk kid.  I requested to go to Korea because of Mercenaries. 10/10 would do again. 100% worth it. Back when I started high school, the army came on a recruiting drive to our high school. They had a plasma on the back of a humvee hooked up to an Xbox and a CoD game. Right next to it they were giving out a ton of shit if you filled out and signed a contact sheet. I saw so many kids play CoD and immediately go over to the sign up booth bragging about their KDs. It was definitely an interesting experience.  That's scary Peggle, Actually.  Well I work in an office and play shooting games in my spare time, so surely soldiers would play... Accountant Simulator? Is that a thing? Call of Duty is literally nothing like being in the military though.

That's like saying a pilot wouldn't want to play Ace Combat... I think everyone here would rather throw away their gaming supplies than be forced to play a cooking game. You've obviously never played Cooking Mama. The point is that the games are made to be fun in a way that the actual work isn't. Combat is nothing like CoD. Kitchen games are nothing like actual kitchen work and I know several people who work in restaurants and play them. Also in the Culinary industry. Overcooked is fun as hell.  > the exciting part 

I think most would call it horrifying, gruesome or haunting, but suit yourself I guess. Performing maintenance and repairs while flying. Maintenance on the ground, I was a crew chief in the Air Force  r/gatekeeping
 I worked on e model 130s as well. I preferred them. Too much micro management on the 17 side  Yea the 17 was easy extremely easy to work on. Dunno what this guy is on about. The C-17 isn't the crown jewel any more, that's the F-35. Jewels are always irrationally expensive and serve no functional purpose. I bet everyone says that about the plane they fly. Yeah. All the hate the game doesn't deserve.  http://imgur.com/YQakgwb It's what the dude is DJing on in the back, isn't it? Some also refer to it as a "floor" Cargo.  Not bombs. At least the recipient gets a carpet... Yeah of course, I always opt for the hammock if at all possible. But there are flights where I can't do it like if it's too crowded. 

That's also why you have to choose strategically where to sit on the plane. Up front you'll be really warm, in the back you'll be really cold, but the middle is the sweet spot.  My favorite are Pallets full of bubble wrap. Better sleep than on a bed. They literally caught me sleeping. Well done Captain. You know who you are. http://imgur.com/zG8Qb86 They have floor heat? That's cool. What for? Is the cargo cabin heated too?  That'll explain why I was fucking freezing for 10 hours last time I flew on one. There are obviously electric outlets if they are playing video games, can you not bring a space heater?  Get an underquilt, yo.  www.hammockgear.com Yeah, it's unbelievably comfortable! Now when I fly commercial on long distances it's brutal; I just daydream about my hammock... I envy you. But now I hear it...I'm believing! I'm doing it!  4 BWOMPS, never 3 DAMN SON WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS Me too haha A state of Flight 643. *hatch opens* GBU-28: the ultimate subwoofer

It's all about that bass. "Bombs by [SrA](https://www.google.com/search?q=sra+senior+airman+rank&oq=sra+senior+airman+rank&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3306j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)" ... are we still doing phrasing? You want to free your mind about a concept of harmony and music being correct, you can do whatever you want. Sigh... here comes another Daft Punk binge... Fuck the first time I listened to that song I was almost brought to tears. It's beautiful.  *Giovanni Giorgio, gotta go for the double 'Gio' prefix when you get it. Thanks for the confirmation. I'm not military, I just remembered the crew config from the Wikipedia (I'm a military hardware fan) What a great movie, I didn't catch that when I first watched Monsters vs. Aliens. Looks like I've got you tagged appropriately "Kids" being a doctorate of computer science in this case... I'm aware of it, but they just didn't rock the synth in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' like they did in 'Monsters vs. Aliens'. Maybe others have missed it but I see what you did In fact you'll probably get 2.66/3 of the way thru it. Just be grateful Valve is making you sick hats and knife skins instead! savage Air Force medic seems like a false reassurance to pilots Air Force optometry here. Haven't been deployed yet but from what I've heard, Qatar is a vacation.  My Grandfather served in Vietnam, he said it was 95% boredom and 5% sheer terror. This is more true for other branches, but in the Air Force, majority of people never see combat in their entire career. 
Is watching porn illegal in the military?  What happens if you are caught watching porn? The QC line is also really popular with pilots because theres a company that makes an after market aviation mic for them. You can have a great Bose headset with mic for half the price as their dedicated aviation headset.  The ones in the picture are QC 15 These are actually the QC15s, but they are still amazing. I have the 25s and I must say the noise reduction is unbelievable when flying.  Are the bose headphones really a good value? I was under the impression that they were a bit overpriced. Can confirm, I have a pair.  Bose Quiet-Comfort 15.  They're absolutely amazing if you're willing to drop $250.  Noise cancelling would be a huge perk on flights like that. LOUD NOISES I took this. [deleted] I have a question, are C-17 a pain to look after?  Oh cool. My dad used to work as a crew chief a couple years ago. I actually got to ride with a C-17 twice. 7/10 would do again.  Hydro never works! I'm Comm Nav though so neither do I haha. C17 crew chief here. I called for hydro an hour ago and now I know why it took so long... you were on reddit B-52 crew chief here. Can confirm my jet sucks and I'm jealous of all of you. How would you know what a c-17 looks like? Hydro never goes further than the smoke pit. Nonner here to confirm C-17 engineer here (former). Can confirm his confirmation. That there is a C-17. C-17 cockpit specialist here. Can't confirm or deny. Cockpit is out of sight. I flew in C-17's both inbound and outbound of Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan 

Edit: Army guy here. Also, SF dudes and some regular Army dudes jump out of C-17's Yup.  Source: Army, flew on a c-17. 

 The air force transports ALL of the armed forces.  The air force is how we get around, period.  Thats what they are there for. Boring old regular Army airborne personnel here. Jumped out of C-17 many times. It's the best for jumping (imo) due to the door having some protection from the air current so you don't get ripped out of the door the second you stick your foot out. Everyone flys in C-17's. I have been on flights with all branches excluding the coastguard. I was a Marine. Without the Army the C-17 wouldn't have half as much to fly around in the first place.
 I feel al the response thus far are just saying "yeah, I rode one" ...

none of them really address the nature of your question ... "What are Air Force planes used for?"  ... perhaps this is only a question in my mind.

The answer is, the AF doesn't fly their planes "for themselves" any more than the Army occupies territory "just for themselves", the CG patrol's coastlines, or the Navy ... navies.

The point being, AF planes are used for their functional role:  not their Branch affiliation, so in this case Large Transport Plane is used by all the branches to *Transport Large Stuff* in Planes.

anyway, former Army grunt, was transported around by C-17 and other means, numerous times.  Thanks for the rides, ChairForce.



 Yes. I parachuted out of a C-17 two days ago. yes, was ARMY. Flew on C-17's both inbound and outbound from Kandahar Air Field as well They do. If a soldier (usually non-private/specialist) is expected at another location, they can hop on a flight if they go through the right channels. Former KC-10 crew chief here checking in. 60MXS Travis 09-13. Also creeped on your profile, fellow VW driver here with a GLI.  Chow hall guy here. Anyone want a shitty in-flight box lunch?  Oh yeah, I've got no problem with upvoting something worthwhile or new to me, regardless of whether or not it's a repost.  The only catch there are the reposts of stuff only hours old, or even minutes.  Those get an instant downvote.  This post got a +1 from me either way, since it's amusing, and it has been months since I saw it last. Shit, are you me? Also had a cozy desk job but am currently on Terminal. Good pay for what I did (CSS), but mind-numbingly boring. Congrats, enjoy that sweet paid vacation. Also the freedom of not being in anymore Well I mention that because at some point they have to adjust the waypoints in the autopilot, that's more than nothing. ;) To a point. Every branch has their really shitty aspects, they're just in different places. Marines and Army prefer physical abuse, Air Force likes psychological, and Navy likes emotional with all that isolation on the ships. ;) "Soldier, what is your name?"

"Taylor." I think the MRAP was specifically designed to take ied's without killing the occupants  100% easily the worst ride in any vehicle I've ever been in. The people who made that decision didn't need to ride in them. I'm willing to bet their vehicles had suspension. Lol thanks for the history of n00bz. Learned something new http://i.imgur.com/7Hr9WR9.jpg Not if you hide in the corner like a little bitch.  Arma taught me that war is 99% walking and 1% getting sniped from a mile away.  Who was the ace of spades  Even Songtan Sally ? They just showed us videos of people climbing walls and jumping out of planes and firing large weapons.  My friend asked the sergeant working the desk "You're showing me all this cool stuff, but how do I know if I joined the Army I wouldn't be stuck in some bum recruiting job like you?"

He was not amused. That is extremely fucked up!  Nothing says military flight like Ode to Joy every few minutes. Oh yeah, I got a Spookieball!!! I fucking love peggle. Ace Combat, man that's a throwback. I remember the cartoon cut scenes were the best. Wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was kid. Shortly after I wanted to be a street racer from playing Need for Speed. Pilot here, I loved the shit out of Ace Combat.  I also like flying in Battlefield 1.

Not very accurate, but they're fun.  If I flew the WWI aircraft like I do in the game, there wouldn't be much aircraft left. I dunno dude, they got it pretty close to real life in this one: https://youtu.be/A5tRNs2X5Q4 You mean the army doesn't keep up with my k/d ratio? But how do they know who's on top of the leaderboards? honestly though i just went and asked my brothers friend int he other room what they played when he was in the millitary and it was modern warfare 2/3.  and  he  was in the shit!  https://youtu.be/QDeLXdSgOGg Agree. Professional athletes play tons of sports games. Sports and military are just fun games. You take that back; Cooking Mama is the bomb! What about Overcooked? except Order Up!, though, for me. Cook Serve Delicious is pretty fun I don't think anyone here really says "gaming supplies". Overcooked is fun. > while flying.

Do you want to get sucked into a jet engine? because that's how you get sucked into a jet engine. While I don't agree with the whole "not a true maintainer" aspect, I have to agree the difference in workload between a C-17 and say a B-1 is fucking enormous. Like hard to comprehend. F-35 is basically leading the charge into the next gen of aircraft. It's one of the first combat system to truly integrate all the high tech gizmos darpa and Boeing come up with but never get used.

Jets it used to be the F16, then the A10 and now the F35 and A10 are battling for ultimate supremacy They do lmao I fly on the C-130J as a loadmaster... C-130s are the REAL crown jewel of the Air Force 😜 I know, that's what I thought at first too, lol. That is an exit ramp of sorts, yeah.  Going home party on a C-17. You saw DJing, I saw ironing. I believe we live different lives 

Edited: lies to lives. Triggereddddddd below But what if the cargo is bombs? But [bomb cargo](http://www.skytamer.com/1.2/2008/8013.jpg).... This guy knows his C-17. The back is where I keep perishables if the fridge is broken... You can freeze stuff on the ramp.   All pressurized space is conditioned air. Floor heat is to keep aircraft components from freezing when the cargo box is depressurized.

But floor heat is usually broken for one reason or another. Hanging out on the floor?

Get a heated blanket next time and plug into one of the 120v receptacles on the cargo wall. Or if you're army, you could cuddle up with your battle buddy. 10 hours would be short, then. Depends on the crew and your command for stuff like that. Heated blankets that fit in your bag are fine, though. Haha yeah but tell me its not brutal full with cargo and pax. Why don't they have horizontal sleeping bunks on commercial flights?  They could probably pack in more people too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqZQ9KM_LjY Keep going!

I think it is a common misconception by the general public that everyone who wears a uniform gets shot at and roughs it on the front line. Flew on this bird for years and was only shot at 3 times in my career. Now this isn't true for US aviators during other wars but in these past ones having 100% control of the air space has made it far less engaging than being an infantryman or operator type. I'd wager most of the air force has never experienced any sort of combat in a traditional sense.   The QC's look way lighter than the A20 as well, not that the A20 isn't super comfortable already

/edit: I've been told that if your battery goes you can't use the mic anymore, which is problematic Soundwise you can get better for less (not that they sound bad), but for the NC it is definitely value for the money. They are absolutely worth it. I have a pair of QuietComfort 35's and they are by far the best headphones I've owned. I'm also pretty sure after they're registered Bose will send you replacement headphones if they break, or at least that's what they've done for me with past headphones  The QC line's noise cancelling is second to none at that price level. You want anything better and you'll be paying a lot more. Sound quality is par for the course, but that's not what you buy them for.

As for their other gear, I've got no idea. But I'm very happy with my QC25's. Their main selling point in their comfort and noise canceling. You can easily find something that sounds much better for substantially cheaper, but then again, the people that buy these Bose headphones are usually buying them for more their comfort, noise cancellation and isolation. Generally Bose is more hype than actual quality but with the quiet comfort series they actually are fairly decent I mean, they are expensive for pretty mediocre sound quality, but if you go on commercial planes, busses, or just have a loud working environment they will make you deaf to outside noise. The quiet comfort ones are worth it. Dem matte black QC-35's tho... The QC35 is more amazing, because wireless! :D Me too! Reddit Occupation Analyst here. Can confirm you can find anyone on Reddit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9kLbrO2vBI Well you know, another Ace Combat 7 trailer was shown 2 days ago at psx, fpr 2017. Same here.  I was super disappointed in the single player pilot missions in BF1 because of the controls...  thankfully the actual game is correct.

What do you fly in real life if you don't mind my asking?  I'm flying a 206 for a survey company currently.  The schedule is too good for me to make the jump to the airlines yet even tho I have the hours... The sickest thing is that people would play that.

Well dammit Johnson get to work there's limbs everywhere! Actually, they also have flight evacuation medics, and we get to do some pretty BA stuff ;)  I heard it from intel people who set up a dish and got  the best internet in the base and played video games all day.  Even getting shot at once would be terrifying as fuck to me... Yeah people don't seem to realize that the air force is mostly support personnel. Maintainers that keep everyone's shit greased, bombs explodey, and the office managers to screw up their leave and earnings statement twice a year.  A20s are amazing. Dad has a few sets for his 180. He also uses one when driving his tractor.  Theres no comparison between the QC's and the A20's as far as comfort, and the A20's are a world better than the X's

The major downside of the QCs is that sound stops coming through when the batteries die. I had a QC for about five years and had the damn thing die at some really bad times.  Can confirm. The headphone jack is broken on mine so I sent mine back and they are sending me another pair, all on their dime.

The Bluetooth worked though and the headphones otherwise are awesome. Expensive but awesome. Got a pair of QC-35's from Apple for $50 because they accidentally left me on hold with AppleCare for three hours and then closed for the night. Got a $300 Apple Store gift card when I filed a complaint. 10/10 would wait on hold for three hours again Military aircraft have restrictions on utilising wireless transmitters in flight, plus stuff on board makes it temperamental in range and interference with the signal. 25s are wired, so it's a safer choice, plus longer battery life. Yeah they have lots of newer models.  Got mine about 7 years ago and it still works perfectly.  The things are essentially unbreakable. We all took this picture on this blessed day.

 Idk, Möbius vs Razgriz is a tough one... I think I have to give t to 4 because I was younger and it took me FOREVER to do the tunnel run on the last level, fire the missile, and pull up just in time. RIP Chopper.

Never forget. Oh good, you saved me the trouble of making that correction. Thanks friend! It's a toss up for me. Both games do a really good job of developing their characters and if we're just comparing Möbius squadron to the Razgriz then 5 wins. But I think 4 has a better overarching story.  /r/hoggit thanks me too The only time I've ever changed one is because sheetmetal drilled through one almost all the way forward and outboard. They had to cut hydro lines out of the way so we could get to it.  Should've made nice with the boom operator. They have extra mats back there that are pretty comfy. I knew that it could be a sound of the future,
But I didn't realise how much the impact would be And exactly why they are picky as fuck about who they put in a pilot seat  farmer, who also has a plane. Thanks for asking Ahnohld I literally clicked "load more comments" to say exactly what you just said.  

I would gladly sit on hold for hours on end if I knew there would be a sweet reward in it for me.  Speakerphone and mobile technology make "holding" far less of a chore than it used to be standing there against the wall with the kitchen phone, or being limited to 1-2 rooms away because your cordless phone had a crummy range.

Almost no one in a (regular) Airborne unit such as the 82nd or the 173rd actually wants to be in that unit.  Anyone who says otherwise has drank way too much of the Kool-Aid.

 If he wants to be a highly-motivated door kicker who shoots people in the face, and he's competent with physical training, he needs to go to Ranger Regiment, which entails enlisting with an 11B Option 40 contract.  

Other than that, there is no reason on Earth to get an Airborne contract, lest you're trying for Special Forces, and that's a whole 'nother shitshow.

If he doesn't plan on being a door-kicker or SF, he'd be far better off in literally any job within the Air Force or Navy. It is kind of hard to give tips as everyone's experience is different.

 Make GTA Great Again!!! Ugh political correctness showing up in games from all the way back then My favorite! As opposed to it being floppy discs.  This was around the time when computers didn't have both, and CD ROM drives were expensive.  

I miss the early days of computers (minus the dial up internet speeds).  Was fun playing those old games like monkey island, loom, doom, among others. Member when GTA had an overhead camera? Like...is this a joke or something?

It was on shelves next to Mac 3.5 floppy games. I got plenty of those for christmas from my well meaning grandmother. ... Dont call me guy, buddy. Is that why the graphics look so good? I literally just watched that episode yesterday!       

Could I **BE** more spooked? I've seen Friends many times but never paid attention to this fact. The eyelash curler is really what made Joey realize the truth. In a few days kids will be posting "TIL that President Trump has appeared in an episode of Friends, which was a popular sitcom in the 90s". And when Joey works at Ross's museum, Chandlers comment goes...

'Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black' For the skeptics: it's Season 5 Episode 5 "The One With The Kips". GTA 1 was great. Always dreaded taking the train cause you could fall down on the tracks and get electrocuted so easily. Also it was my favorite thing to run over those runner teams. I'm still waiting for the electric gun to make a come back. I played them both when they were new.  Still have them. I liked farting on people.  I have played both. I remember the day I first got GTA 2, it had amazing graphics. I remember having the demo for well over a year before I got the full game. It was time limited but you could do anything as long as it was within ten minutes so I'd just work my way down each thread of storyline in the first city until time ran out, then try to do it faster. GTA London was amazing too. Yup, played the first one loads. GTA2 didn't run properly on our P133 Old dude here. GTA has been one of my favorite game franchises since the very first one. I played Gta 1 on ps1. Once the game loaded up you could open the ps1 and put in an audio cd of your choice. My mind was blown when I played it for the first time. Very few games have caused a light bulb flash moment but this certainly did.  I played then both back in the day. They were so much fun but then 3 came out and changed things up. After 3, I never really played 1 and 2 again. Played a lot of GTA 2, it might be my favorite PS1 game, i literally played it so much i ended up buying multiple copies since i would play it until my PS1 couldn't read the disk anymore and GTA1 was really good too but i didn't like the fact that you couldn't repeat missions if you failed them and some of them were kinda too hard in the last levels. Had them when they first appeared on the PS1, plus my cousin had GTA2 on the PC when it came out which we spent far too much time playing on. The first one I played was two.  Would always start of doing missions, then use the tank cheat to rack up a million with the tank (which is how you would unlock other parts of the city) and then start playing again. I played a lot of GTA 1.  
If you were to shoot a rocket down the middle of a long highway, you could actually catch up to the rocket in a fast car. The rocket couldn't hit a car while you were still in it... I've played it a lot when it first came out, I absolutely love that game!  The GTA wiki describes Donald Love as: *"He is the multi-billionaire owner of the Love Media conglomerate and is also involved in construction and real estate industries."*

So it's not far off. He even tries to become Mayor of Liberty City

Plus: *"He is known to have changed laws, been involved in slum clearance and opened casinos across the United States, in the process becoming a "legend" according to a Liberty Tree report."*

Yup.

He's also a cannibal. Donald Love. [deleted] Jock Cranley for governor (GTA V)? I don't think he's supposed to be entirely Donald Trump because the game was released in 2013 but you could easily imagine him partly being a trump parody as it fits. His political opponent though, Sue Murray, is likely a hilary clinton pisstake. I couldn't help but laugh at the part where he insults her and throws shit at her HQ....

"In GTA V, he is the main conservative candidate in the race for governor of the State of San Andreas. His main rival is liberal candidate Sue Murry. He has commercials on TV and a website at Jockcranley.com. On these, Cranley promises to eliminate taxes by selling off unnecessary parkland and reducing the education budget by 98%. He is reported to attempt to humiliate his opponent a lot, calling her "names that rhyme with 'front' and 'scratch'", portraying her as a bloody, demonic monster, and even throwing feces at her campaign headquarters. He also appears on Bless Your Heart, a talk radio show on Blaine County Talk Radio. He and the show's host, Bobby June, discuss politics, the election, Cranley's background, and do some cooking. During the show, Cranley reveals that he has had three families and it is implied that he is sexually attracted to the friends of his 16-year-old daughter.

In his radio advertisements, Cranley states that he hates "immigrants, gays, and the crippled" and also "can't stand unions, cops or old ladies"." Now that I think of it he is pretty much a GTA character.  The candidates for governor of San Andreas seem eerily familiar though.

By stealing a train and then ramming it into another or letting another train ram into your train. Which resulted in spectacular explosion of both trains (and your death). I mean, GTA IV has a statue of Hillary Clinton... Oh no grandma can't use the internet and grandpa said another racial slur I can't wait for either of them to run the country. When it's cold, rainy, and generally dreich, it infuses our spirit with cynicism unlike any other. I don't know how incisive it is. Rockstar built their world on movie cliches, and their satire is pretty much standard cliches as well.  I think sometimes you get a better satirical take when you're on the outside looking in. [deleted] They're trying.   I still wonder why it's called r/politics.. I went there once expecting politics or at least posts about both sides, but it was just one big anti-trump convention and they weren't even trying to hide it. We're gonna take the money out of GTA Online folks! Well, you have to release the game before you can make it great again. Who's going to pay for it?! SAINTS ROW! > Tim Kaine (who is gay)... 

I have no idea what why but the phrasing of this cracks me up literally every time I see it  Confirmed

"This is making too much sense" This makes way more sense than it honestly should. I played the hell outa gta 2. My mom wouldn't let me get gta 3 when it came out cause I would have been about 8yrs old and it was rated M. but 2 was only rated T so I was able to play it, and I played so much of it, just dicking around, I don't think I ever finished missions or even saved my game. He does seem like the type of President the GTA world would elect: A walking work of political satire.  Praise KEK DRAIN THE SWAMP MGTAGA With a name like "CheetoFap", I don't know if serious or not. oh we are Maybe you're just shit at mocking?  Isn't Donald Trump a cannibal in GTA? Don't forget it had multiplayer, and game show announcements when you did awesome things. "Kill frenzy!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rqdWNI5Qmk  BOSS He'll have a heart attack. Holy shit a GTA game set in DC would be amazing, even better if Trump is elected and they base a character on him. TRUMP - PENCE 2016!!!!!!! TREMENDOUS! Pepe is a nazi frog!

REEEEEEEEEEEE! And all of their vote bots! It's a threat My dad uses an ellipsis at the end of so many of his texts unnecessarily.

When you purchased a game you got like a billion floppy disks, that you inserted one after the ohter to install the game. took fucking ages. 

  
so yeah, CD rom was a big selling point back in the day.  Make Theft Auto Grand Again! Tremendous. They really could have done something with the election. Like an update. Grand Theft Auto, the most politically correct of all the games. Triggers literally kill people. Gun triggers, that is. I member. But member getting the tank and destroying everything in your path for hours.  I went from GTA 3 to GTA 2. Young me was not prepared for the overhead camera. I thought it was really awesome to include that camera angle in GTA3.  How many other series that transitioned play styles so hard gave you the option to keep the original?  Imagine if Ocarina of Time had an overhead mode, haha. Pepperridge farm remembers This is /r/gaming, home to millions of people who have no idea what a 3.5" floppy is, and even consider CD's "outdated" because "why not just download it through Steam?" 19 years ago you had to specify what format you were selling on and many today don't understand that. Stop judging me... Don't call me buddy, pal Please stop calling me gay, I touched a willy in High School once and it was just a little mistake Haha, clever and original meme dude!

They were Hare Krishnas.

***GOURANGA!*** I'm pretty sure that was supposed to be Hare Krishna groups. They chanted a wierd mantra and they all wore orange. Oh man. And reversing in a bus was the best. Any car you touched just blew up. I had so much fun In that game back in the day.  My sister and I used to pretend like the character was siamese twins (he looked really weird when walking, lol) so we controlled each our half of the keyboard/movement keys... Lol. Reeeeeeeeemember, respect is EVERYTHING  Same, and the London one. I found the CD cases for them when moving a bit ago. I forget which version (maybe all of them?) you could connect two PCs with a serial cable and play 2 player as well. GTA had multiplayer way before everyone thinks. So did I. I was disappointed when I first played GTA3 and found out you couldn't pick which gang to work for. Same. Although I didn't really like them very much back then. I remember being more into Carmageddon and Need for Speed.  I missed the old way of gangs they had in that one, very organized with their own cars and territory. Once they took out gangs like that in 4 it changed the whole atmosphere. Man that jump animation was revolutionary. I remember not even realizing for quite some time there were missions to be done. I just drove around smearing blood and fire on everything. The missions made the game even better! My best friends older brother showed me and my buddy the demo, I remember him saying the game was banned in Europe, we were hooked instantly. When I got home I downloaded it and had so much fun playing. I could have swore the time limit was 3 mins. Eventually me or my friend found an add on or a mod or a script that made the demo ignore the time limit. The timer would still run but once it hit zero you could just keep playing, amazing. Although the time limit was gone you still were segregated to a small part of the map because you needed to beat certain missions to open bridges to the next areas and those missions weren't in the demo, because of that I eventually went out and bought the game at Best Buy. The other day I was cleaning out some old boxes and stumbled across the manual, the nostalgia was real. I think you can download and play the game for free now off rockstars website if I am not mistaken, but it might only work for PC.

* [It's a known fact that the relations between Hillary Clinton and Rockstar Games "ain't" the best. Actually, some might think that there's no way they could get worse, but, if some (very hard to believe) rumors are true, GTA IV will come dropping bombs and seeking a little bit of revenge over Hillary Clinton: it is said that a blog posted press release by Rockstar announced that all the prostitutes in the next installment of the Grand Theft Auto franchise will look like Hillary Clinton.](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Hillary-Clinton-Lookalike-Prostitutes-in-GTA-IV-76284.shtml) Love was smooth, calm, reserved, and intellectual, however. In case anybody is wondering if the game figure has a resemblance, there is none. He doesn't look at all like Trump though, he only shares the wealth and the first name.

Maybe it is but seems to be missing a few points.  By giving us a god dang single player DLC. >Great Theft Again

Sounds like an A-OK game title! MGGA? MAGA People come to me from all over, all over. They say to me, they say "You have the best buildings". It's true. Sorry lobbyists, but it's true.  Fitting.  And you could derail a train in San Andres. I can't remember if any other ones did this or not.  It does? CNN BREAKING NEWS: NOTHING TO SEE HERE The only racism is in the democrat leaked emails.  As an American whom loves his country I would argue that America itself is a land built on movie cliches. (and most of OUR satire is standard cliches as well) It's extremely broad "haha politicians are the REAL liars and crooks, folks!" crap (and as of GTA 5 it was expanded into "haha millenials and hipsters suck, don't they, folks?" straight out of 2009). The actual specifics of American businesses and politics are never touched on, because...well, they're not from here. Can't really blame them.

People who say GTA is incisive satire usually have absolutely no idea what satire is really about. TWL Please And make Rockstar pay for it?  He really is gay? I don't know a single thing about him  Then again, with the crimerates in GTA it seems more appropriate for Hillary to be president there, she'll fit right in. Free Pepe! Bad idea, swamps and wetlands are important ecosystems that contain a lot of biodiversity and help regulate and store water. He's very serious.  > I don't know if serious or not.

The Trump campaign in a nutshell. He comments in /r/The_Donald... MAGA! It's just a game bro. Remember the Elvis impersonators that would walk single file? If you ran them all over with a car you would get the "Elvis has left the building!" Nah his Male Vitality pills have given him immortality  [deleted] > It's a threat...

KILLLLLLLLLLLLLL FRENZY!

When you were were on a rampage and the car you were in was making that clinking noise indicating it was about to blow up, and the cops that were chasing you are coming up full speed on your ass, and you need to slow for something and they ram your ass full speed and you go BOOM. 

Hilarious. Miss the shit outta that game.  LOL I had no idea that that's what they were, of course back then I had no idea what Hare Krishnas were  Brings me back

Such a great game Saints Row ran off with that idea when they made their first two games. [Grand Theft Auto 2 - Main Theme
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv6mWA7OQiM) DAMNATION!  NOOO DONATION, NOOO SAAAALVATION! Wow, I had forgotten about the London one until you mentioned it.  That one was a blast, but I always had a hard time staying on the correct side of the road. GTA 2 had multiplayer that would work by setting up a game server through the game. Easy to use 1vs1 multiplayer. I think GTA 1 had it as well. It worked pretty well on a 56k connection (slight lag). Worked perfectly on broadband.  GTA London had the best soundtrack by far.   [deleted] More to that point I actually think the gang loyalty mechanic from 2 was one of the most interesting things the series ever did. It's a shame they never expanded on it. But there's an arrow that points to the payphones!  I did not even realize you could enter a car and drive around. All the cheat codes were names of porn mags. Razzle, Penthouse etc I had the 12mb voodoo2 3dfx card! That thing was a life saver for old computers with a 4mb vga card when you wanted to play games. Gamers today are so spoiled, just blows my mind how much gaming has changed with my cell phone having so much more power but all these damn micro transactions. 

Edit: check out this SLi dual Voodoo2 3dfx cards in action https://youtu.be/-pmpdQ073-4 Unless you needed to load something Apart from track 1 which was just noise from what I remember If you've gone through the stories, Donald Love is the guy that looks like the Michelen Man in GTA 3. And he's the little short guy that takes notes in a cutscene with Averi Carrington in Vice City (Vice City takes place before 3, so Donald would've been younger).  Love trumps hate, in any case. Yum Sounds like Rob Ford You are what you eat. >all the prostitutes in the next installment of the Grand Theft Auto franchise will look like Hillary Clinton.

Well that's not true. All you have to do is look at the cover of 4 to see that. Isn't Sue Murry in GTA V a parody of Hillary?  Hillary Clinton is a large African American woman? Because that's a large portion of the prostitutes. Quote from the Statue of Happiness page

"The other day I had the unfortunate experience of getting up-close and personal with the Statue of Happiness. It's horrible! I could swear that disgusting strange smile on her face reminds me of someone, too. That's the face of a woman who needs some work done, or some action, or both! I mean, she is seriously living a lie, that one, and for what? She just stands there and does nothing! Reminds me of my mother. If I was married to that cold slab of stone I'd be off with any fat bird who'd take me. It's amazing that angry black heart of hers still beats in her chest."
―The Celebinator Doesn't need to look like him does it? Plus if they went for the obvious hair and copied his look, Trump would have likely sued Rockstar.

How much more about the actual specifics of American businesses and politics would you expect from a vidogame that's not a business or politics simulator, though?

They've covered the various elections, the parties, the economic meltdown/mortgage crisis, obesity, oversold  and increasingly worthless college education, etc.

They've stayed away from libelous detail; but come on, after "hot coffee" and Jack Thompson and the current dem candidate whom I shall not name going after them it's reasonable. [deleted] Bigly.

http://www.rockstargames.com/gta/ My go-to was throwing a couple of punches at the groups, then lead them to a risen bridge. At the very last moment, would chuck a U-turn and watch them all gracefully kill themselves (well, most on average, if not all on the occasion) with a graceful swan dive as they fell off the edge.

They weren't very smart.  I always loved killing these Elvis Presley' fans in GTA 2:

https://youtu.be/C-YJy9M53lY One time I was on a mission. It prompted me to meet someone in an empty lot (somewhere near the bottom of the screen, right side, by the docks I think) but it was a trap! There were a bunch of gangsters with guns firing at me. I drove at them and did an oversteer left turn skid that wiped out like 4 of them, on the rebound I did a right turn oversteer skid and the ass end of the car wiped out the rest! Clean kill. It was beautiful! On the screen right after it I get a message that says : PSYCHO BASTARD BONUS!
The one and only time i ever got that achievement. I told my brother who still thinks I'm full of shit.  fucking elvis conventioners oh man, there were time I wasn't even playing, just started the game to listen to this. I know what you mean.  There was always people driving the wrong way in my lane. I'd love to see a modern GTA game set in the UK. But up North. Never gonna happen, but it'd still be cool. "I want all you skinheads to get up on your feet 
Put your braces together and your boots on your feet 
And give me some of that old moonstomping"  i've heard you're a bit tasty, so no messing around or you'll get a slap. remember, i'm the monkey and you're the cheese grater. I don't live in New York, nor have I ever been to America, but is this a reflection of the decline of the gangland sort of stuff in the 90s, or just down to more advanced and varied character models?  I can see why they changed it though, they just moved towards a narrative type story and went away from the 'create you own'. Killing spree or go talk on a phone? Yeah, easy decision for a teenager.  Yea, I had a voodoo 2 as well, and eventually went to sli. Those guys were great. I played some of my most memorable games on them. As I said, *most* cached everything they needed, and were often fault-tolerant enough to wait for you to switch disc again He's also got a huge part to play in GTA: Liberty City Stories. Like, half of the game is about helping him out. That's a pro-trump expression, right? RIP in piece Dead? This is from before the launch and Rockstar teasing.

Was quite the joke at the time. Probably. She's pretty much a huge parody of liberal politicians, who wants to ban guns AND knives, raise taxes for the rich to over 98% and close all prisons.

She also runs against Jock Cranley, who is not only a Conservative but also a rich celebrity, always attacks Sue with mysoginistic slurs and is sexually attracted to his daughter's 16 year old friends. He also hates immigrants. Look at the quote again. It's clearly from before the game was launched. If Rachael Dolenzal and Sean King can do it, why not? wh...at? >He's married to a woman

No, he's married to a Pence. Yeah like that spirit cooking shit. At first I thought it was surely a parody of some sort, but no.  Don't you mean $hillary?

Ha, do you guys see what I did there? Hard to tell if you are being sarcastic or not... "Oh what are you looking at you wouldn't be in any danger!"

"So they ARE in danger!" But they'd never say no... Are you gonna hurt these women? "*whispers*Dennis, are you planning on hurting these girls?" Okay you had me goin' there for the first half. The second half kinda threw me. Polly, want an orgasm? She's got the best genes
 The daughters are hot, but the sons dont look good at all lol She's 35.. although not in that picture I'll freely admit she is hot, but goddamn her father is creepy with her.  


She kind of won the genetic lottery considering how messed up most of her siblings look.  It's OK guys, he has said we can call her a hot piece of ass  Shes kinda hot. You should be creeped out her dad thinks so too. Double down: she is, superficially, attractive, and her father is, in every conceivable fashion, a creep. I say she *is*, and she can 'stop, drop and roll' right into my lap. Incest is wincest, tho'.  ># [deleted] > > like this:

It's equal opportunity in criminality. we're all criminals on this blessed day There are also Jamaicans, Ukrainians, unspecified Eastern Bloc-ers, Irish... wow they really did fit in a lot of minorities Especially considering how just about all of the minority characters are violent criminals. Not exactly super progressive. Except it's definitely not inclusive because I don't think I've ever seen a female gang member in any game apart from specific characters. Very satisfying crunchy krishnas DAMN IT, YOU BROKE THE MEME! 

Screw you, dude! And I'm your friend.  Papa? Kifflom brother-friend You could download it up until recently - I still have the installer, but the game doesn't run on Win 8/10 at all, and has a notorious bug even in Win 7 that corrupts save files (you can get patching tools though). I've been meaning to spin up a Win XP VM to run it.  This is my problem with Forza Horizon 3. Gta: hull has a nice ring to it Edinburgh, Glasgow and Stirling with the Highlands to the north and Borders to the south could be fun.

Although the cities probably aren't big enough. Probably both yeah gangs these days don't really want to be as obvious as they used to be (decked out in full gang colors, face tattoos etc.) this is true in many countries (for instance the japanese yakuza used to be much more recognizable with their flashy suits and gang lapel pins.) the trend over the last thirty years has been towards the subtler end of the spectrum. Setting them against each other would be a good story.  [deleted] Since March. > attracted to his daughter's 16 year old friends

 Close... but no cigar.  Ugh thats so last month. Its Killary now Fucking got em! No coming back from that!  I am, and I hope so too for the rest of these pro-trump comments.

Manchester would be the most obvious choice out of the major cities in the North, I guess, but I live in Sheffield so I'm a little biased towards God's own county. It's so bad. Let's identify the problems with the phrase.

http://leadstories.com/Clinton%20Love%20Trumps%20Hate.jpg

* "Love" is in Red, and red is identified with the Republican Party GOP

* "Trumps" is in dark blue, the color behind the stars on the American flag.

* "Hate" is in a light blue, which is identified with the Democratic Party (DNC)

* "Love Trumps Hate" out loud sounds like "[I] Love Trump's Hate"

* You *never* have an opponent's name as the first name you see. Go to HillaryClinton.com and the first thing you'll be greeted with is "We can't risk a **Trump** presidency"

* "Trump" has been associated with the successful enterprise for decades, and its meaning is still stuck inside people's heads. "Love Trumps Hate" is flawed because "trump" does not have a negative connotation just yet. Its Bill that will be coming on someone's back.

We've come a long way friends... War never changes... I remember there used to be this place that just had like 32 computers connected on LAN and they charged by the hour.  Some of my fondest gaming memories playing 1942 Desert Combat right there. So many good memories. That game was buggy as hell when it came out and we couldn't care less. The first time I spawned at the airfield, went running for a plane, heard the buzz of the Zeroes getting louder and getting strafed by their guns I was hooked. We had a LAN party the day after it came out and played nearly 24 hours straight ending the night loading up as many people as we could on the wings of a B-17 to make paratrooper screenshots. > reminds me of this ***classic***

*clicks link and looks at video.....*  *sees that video came out last year and only has a 150 views.* F11 The biggest let down in BF1 is that you can't head bang in the jeep / motorcycles. Oh god I forgot about this video - that was a good oldie'
 Lmfao I was gonna post this too. Almost 15 years ago? I remember my friends and I always imitating that video.

The loose bow hairs give me anxiety. definitely the shovel No, the ping pong racket  \* *Entrenching Tool* It's when you rig a ping pong match. Its obvious the guy who pointed it out doesn't really know what a ping pong paddle really is and what a trench shovel really is. It's because rackets are for tennis because they are made of wire. Paddles are solid and I think they need to be wood but I'm not sure of that  Also it's spelled racquet if it's the tennis type not the extortion type Then you've never experienced a bunch of drunk dudes gathered around an intense pingpong tourney, now THATS a pingpong racket They had Skull Candy's in 1910? I thought I was cool not old school :( God damn it, Barry. Quit messing with the timeline! No, thank you other barry Doesn't make sense since battlefield 1942 was 1941 versions newer.  Who knew graphics in 1918 were better than in 1942. BF1942 was still my favorite up to this point, though I have not played BF1 yet. But the beat does ...or does it?  


The war has changed. This one's for my helmet bro! Desert Combat! I still pine for a game with those helicopter controls back. the video came out way before that. not sure if youtube was even a thing back then. that's just the date this youtuber uploaded it and i linked this one, because it was the first link google gave me. Clearly a re-up ...? That's insane. I've played that game for long stretches and never got any weirdness at all. The game is too small scale and the gfx are a little too low to fully immerse me. Every brain is different, though.

I get more intensity from Squad, actually... when you're in a firefight and everyone's communicating well I get really immersed. Squad in VR might actually give me shell shock.  Who woulda thought that a screen that's  mere cm's from your face could cause a reaction after hours of play....

God damnit, Barry. They just went a bit overboard with the retro style in the future. And the world was in color too! BF1942 and BF2 had so many amazing mods. They actually still have fairly active communities, but it's too bad Dice has dropped mod support for all their newer games.  The series has gone downhill ever since they removed car radios from the game. ... and the [beat](https://youtu.be/NQfb3InOwGs?t=15s) goes on, yeah! B-b-b-bloody screen! SO REAL! Has it? 

YES? NO?

I can't wait to see some retro gaming art in the future. It'll be super high definition yet remind us of a place that feels like home. Hell, I still actually play Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory now. Nostalgia cash-in or not, I want to ride that wave where it takes me. Funny story,

I used to go to an inner city high school back when I was a junior. There was this girl who legitimately though that people before 1970 only saw the world in black and white. Her logic behind this was that pictures were in black and white so they must only see in black and white. 

The teacher looked like he was about to stroke out and everyone in the class bashed her for it for the rest of the year. 



She dropped out of school by the end of the year Bad Company 2 was great as well, but as you mentioned, without the mod support, they have lost my respect in some ways. That is what made those games so great. I was a huge member of the modding community (started a mod called Rallyfield back in the day), and it is really what kept me so interested and playing the game so long.  The Modern Combat mod was so fucking good. Just too awesome.

My greatest gaming achievement was learning how to fly those God damned helicopters.  BF 1942: Forgotten Hope should've just been a patch for 1942.

"Why is this guy showing me his wallet and yelling?" 10 something got damn years this shit has been a meme in my household. Thank you for this OP. The stranger swiped your ID away at the end. I think she's being suspicious of you.

I think you need to flash your ID more. Medal of Honor was my life as a kid, I think if I had a counter of how many hours I put into it it would be over 2000 hours. That soundtrack was just amazing. I preferred [this](http://i.imgur.com/m0ZTxgx.mp4) method. #**YOU ARE JIMMY PATTERSON!!** The bread is delicious. I have no idea why this is so funny *Du Bist Nicht Friedrich! Der Uniform ist Falsch!* This seems funny, but I haven't played the game. Can someone explain what's going on here?  Your wife seems tired of your shit OP. She may be using you for your prime subscription. Beware. "It's ok I,m a limo, driver!" What's in the box!!?? I was so glad to see him show it to the kid too So many memories came flooding back to me while watching this... Your neighbor's wife is hot.  You're clearly an amateur at this technique.  I'm amazed that woman didn't see through your obviously shaky credentials with such precarious form.

The character in the game even did it correctly! You open the wallet with your hand *at the side*, not the top!

Shameful, to be perfectly honest.  *Forbid* our hardworking taxpayers see the sorry current state of our covert operatives!


 Frontline was a fucking great game, I need to play it again I don't get it. I was just thinking about that mission recently! I was wondering which game that was from. It was very memorable.  THIS GAME. Its either you're sneaking around with your identification papers or you're taking on a fortress completely alone using the crates of american made weapons and ammo just laying about.  Not gonna lie, this made me super happy. It's like POV porn, except it's not porn, it's just people looking happy. Sounds super creepy, but legit made me smile and feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Wish there was more stuff like this in the interwebs. /r/outside 

Edit: dropped my t your kid is like fuck this shit This game was the shit ! Medal of Honor: Frontline was one of my favourite games to play as a kid. Absoulutly amazing game. Maybe ill see if I can download it to play it for nostalgia sake. this is by far my favorite reddit post of all time They really need to remaster these games  *please do it to the kid....please do it to the kid....*

YES.

Thank you for the laugh OP Greatest game ever.  You know its a Grade A dad joke when it's repeated 9 times  You're not friedrich! Damn this guy is good WHAT'S IN THE BOX? I love the look of disappointment the kid gives him after he flashes the wallet at him.  Ihre Papiere bitte Slightly psysic paper Anyone else notice the URL is gfycat.com/SelfishMatureCentipede? 

I feel like there's some sort of social commentary there.  Your papers, please The look on the kids face...."Hmmm...checks out" Your son looked like he was tired of your shit. :P
 your wife is a keeper seriously... anybody else would've called the police after the second time And this is why Medal of Honor will be eternally know to me and my friends as "Fuckin PAPERS!" Theres no way that's his wife. She's laughing at his jokes. Had a good chuckle.

Your wife is hot btw dude, good catch. Wow that worked beautifully. They just welcomed you into their house like you were family. Amazing. r/bettereveryloop Your son is like "When will he finally grow up?"  This deserves gold, I'm sure your son will grow up in the household we all wish we grew up in  Isn't this a repost? Relationship Goals. Couldn't even grab the amazon package off the front step.  This is brilliant! LMAO.

I'm serious, the fact that you kept repeating it over and over made really funny.  Man. Nostalgia. One of my favorite video game missions of all time. Also, there was a similar mission in Medal of Honor: Rising Son, but this one is the icing on the cake I died about the tenth time,  but was already laughing the entire time. Also, Frontline possibly is one, if not is, the greatest FPS of all time. Such a brilliant game. Did anyone else make sound effects for the wallet in their head? Man I loved those levels. I loved this game growing up.

I remember I asked my dad for Call of Duty (the first one) for Christmas and he ended up getting me Frontline instead. My brother and I had a blast playing it. I thoroughly enjoyed how committed you were to showing your family your credentials  Its funny cause if you did that enough to some of the soldiers, some would realize it was fake and would start to shoot at you.  [Here you go listen to this and make your day 20x better.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv7QcsuvfH0) ["daddy, please"](http://i.imgur.com/sIgNKcs.png) Don't listen to this man! This is my wife, kid, and stealth tactic! You can tell his kid is just fed up with this shit.  Dude all the passwords were types of ape Frontline?  Shit. The very first MOH had this.   I remember loving this mission because it was rare to see a mission like that at the time.

Your wife and son are adorable by the way.  Way to go OP! your son looks so disappointed in you Wow your wife was actually smiling all the time. Where do you find women like that? My wife would be pissed after 4sec slamming the door in my face. Dude, I just tried with my neighbor and it didn't go well. Police is outside my house now. What did I do wrong?  I'd like to think this is how you greet your family every time. Your wife looks like AJ Cook. And you have a lovely family. We have sons about the same age. 

Congrats on your new-found ability.  Goddamn this is some quality posting.

Probably my favourite thing on this sub. Idk why this is so funny.  Anyone else expecting porn? I grew up with this game in my household, goddamn operation: Rapunzel was the best. 
"Wait your not Fredrick" blast his head off with the shotgun in the corner and just raid the shit outta that mansion.
And always remember Da Woiks
 The persistence is key, it starts off sort of funny, then gets annoying, and then after like 5 to 7 wallet flashes it reaches higher levels of funny. Your son is adorable. Also very confused. Holy your wife is gorgeous  The kid wasn't impressed by your credentials Well that was unexpected. Your son and wife are beautiful though. I'm genuinely curious what everyone's favorite level was in this game?   
Mine was "arnhem knights". Fighting through the streets and then having opened up areas where you were given some freedom was a cool new thing in games back then.   
A close second would be either the submarine level or the nijmegen bridge level.  That mission is one of the reasons I love video games. So much fun. Thank you developers, I love you guys  The kid gave you the once over and the look of, "the fuck is this?" Your son has the look of, "not this shit again" your wife can't keep a straight face and it makes this whole thing look like the beginning of a porno Easily the best post here since Battlefield elevator  psychic paper works on most everyone. DU BIST NICHT FRIEDRICH!!!! Good looking wife, cute kid, and great comic timing, you got it all! 

If you actually filmed this yourself, well done man, this is hilarious content!  As everyone has said, this is what this subreddit needs. Oh man, Medal of Honor is the freaking reason why I got into history today, thanks to that game. Even your kid looks like he's sick of your shit. /r/meirl ? Does it bother anyone else that the game uses the left hand, but the dad uses the right? Why did this disappear so quickly from the front page? Hat I don't understand is they're remastering all these games and leaving Frontline and Rising Sun back in the past.  Get with the program. I need frontline on next gen! I wish we would get a remaster of this. Or something thats updated to run on current machines. I bought it on gamecube, but playing it on a 1080p tv is really hard. https://youtu.be/mdIO0aYKZ2E Enjoy your new family I can't stop laughing get this guy an award What is this, ID you flash to make them think "Oh, this is just our comrade, you can tell by his ID"? One of my favorite ps2 games So this post is just to show the ultra hot wife right? This is the day your kid knows you're a weirdo lol I definitely would've messed up and bloodied my wife's nose if you know what I mean. Papers! Video games can give real life skills like hand-eye coordination and sneaky marriage.  That kid is adorable! She's a good sport! "Papers please!!" The girl at the end is stunning. Instant crush. "Yup, that's my dad alright." "I'm never getting a little brother if dad doesn't quit this lame shit with mom" "I don't have time for this shit, Darryl" Kids still a toddler and already done with this dude's shit. Son: "I can't believe my Mom fucked this guy..." The kid's, what?, 3 years old?  He already looks like he's tired of dad's shit. No, I just barged into a stranger's house! The stealth tactic works!

^(Yeah, that's my wife.) I liked when he did it to the toddler and he was like "Uh, what?"  Who also has Aryan features so it's still realistic. The kid is what got me. He was like v.v fuck let him in Id watch a gif of that Kinda like the "Batdad" on vine. His kids are so fed up with his bullshit in some of those videos. Metal Gear... that's why I'm living in a cardboard box. Yep. Get on it OP!  Or under it as it were. I'm only shocked I couldn't find an episode of Mega64 with that.  Good ol Jimmy Patterson. A name I'll never forget. I used to know that whole intro speech. You are about to embark upon the great crusade toward which we have striven these many months. I did this with DDay! It was in the third grade though. My teacher pulled my mom aside and said I was a creative writing genious  So you... plagiarized?  Nice, I did the exact same thing using the tomb raider 2 plot. I used the story of someones RPG Maker game i played the night before my English final.  I passed.  Thank you, creator of Remote Control. "your papers are in oder" We had to come up with a fictional short story for one of my English paper. I just took the Halo Reach storyline and mixed it with the Halo 4 story I did that with a narration over one of the characters in Heavy Rain.

Highest English grade Is got up to that point. Ha I did the same thing with Red Dead Redemption and John Marston I had to do an English assignment in grade 8 (12-13 years old) where we had to write a story with a moral. I was really into rathergood.com at the time and just copied the story from ["Mark Llama, Gerbil Farmer"](http://rathergood.com/mark/) nearly word for word and added some ridiculous moral to it that I can't remember. Somehow my teacher loved it and gave me an A. Username checks out I'm so proud to be your 4th sub. Would you ever consider dedicating this channel to just "medal of honoring" people? Did she slap it out of your hand at the end? add fake laughs like "Friends" and it's perfect This makes me so happy. Something tells me she's seen this side of you before...  Unimpressed by your shit. So happy to see this game on this sub. That game is probably my all time favorite. And that music. I still find myself humming it randomly once in a while. Halo music was great, but there's something special about that Frontline music. Sticks with me like Band of Brothers music. Hope you loved it as much as I did! That scarily makes perfect sense, haha... Time to rig my wallet to say that for real now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMuVajp1RRo I remember this guy when he was in Orlando lol The more I hear him say his name, the more I think this guy is just a Sim.  He's trying so hard so hard to make it sound 'mericun. Bless his heart. And his profile. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPYnn0sDt3o Why does he say his name like it's a question? XD Dae remember this old gem  
(Witcher 3 cover picture)  Just so everyone remembers, don't preorder!1!!!111one!!!11 i must not come by here often because there are whole subs just for yard sales

/r/gamecollecting  Or "I miss playing this game as a kid" where the moron literally just adds the cover art of the game and that's it. She did nazi him coming.... Don't forget his Amazon Prime subscription! This guy is the 1%

Edit: the 1% of people whose lives go according to plan^^^^minehasnt It's not the hotness of the wife that counts but the fact that she puts up with his bullshit with a smile.  By far the #1 quality to look for in a wife in my opinion. This rich fucker with his (probably real) leather wallet.  He might live in a place as pointless as Ohio or something. Just trying to help OP your wife is pretty, congratulations.  Came to say this Amen r/incels  I use to play this game and still make the *"Papers"* joke all the time.

However, I still immediately picture Matt Smith with his psychic paper ID. And when he gets to heaven


To Saint Peter he will tell


One more soldier reporting, sir


I've served my time in Hell.


- June 6, 1944 With perhaps the greatest soundtrack ever composed for a video game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv7QcsuvfH0 It was my first ever World War game and I miss it so much. Been dying for a World War game on the PS4 but instead, we get all this modern/infinite robotic warfare instead. I used to play Frontline all the time with my dad... My favourite mission was the hotel one pictured because I liked the pseudo-stealth action, it made me feel like a spy. Of course, my dad had to save my ass every time I got busted because 7 year old me couldn't aim an M1 very well. He's not yelling, though. He's eerily silent through the entire thing. Hahaha about a year ago, I was tripping on mushrooms and watched an ant go about his business for about 20 minutes. I kept saying "Let me see your papers!" in a shitty German accent. I had to explain the reference to my friends. Good times. Frontline and Rising Sun were the shit.  Side by side multiplayer.  The overpowered m1 garand, how ridiculous the battleship level was....seeing the battleships sink or the Germans shoot your buddy who gets caught up on the windmill. Fuck I miss those games.  They have the soundtrack on spotify so sometimes ill put it on in place of other military video games music. It captured the emotion so well ManorHouse Rally, and Arnhem Knights.  Two of my favorite Videogame  soundtracks.  The original was one of the only games I had on PS for a while. It's all we needed.

I remember when Underground came out how mindblowing it was that you had allies fighting beside you.

Frontline was amazing. Probably the best in the series.

Rising Sun was my first real online shooter. My friends didn't have the online adapter thing you needed on PS2, so I was used to playing good players and they would play bots. I'd absolutely crush them. 

I'd pay 100 bucks easily for a remastered collection of those 4. i played that mission with the windmill about 50 times a day.  *trots backwards maintaining eye contact*

*pulls alarm* PATTERSON! HEY PATTERSON!  The bread is delicious. That cook was batshit insane but god damn could he bake some bread.  The noodles are wet and spicy You're probabaly 18 or so then. This is an older game, and this specific mission shown was very memorable to all of us.

Pretty much the first time stealth was implemented into the copious amounts of WW2 games.

And if anybody started getting supicious you flashed your ID (only weapon for that mission and the trigger flashed it) and you were safe.

It's mostly nostalgic. Uniform is female. Die Uniform. Also make sure to not capitalize every singe word, just all nouns. And the second prounouns singular and plural, if you wanna be polite in writing. Apart from that: not bad. 6/10, zertifiziert. There was a mission where you had to steal the clothing/ID of a Nazi and infiltrate an event. It's been a while, so a few of those details may be wrong. Anyway, you had to flash your ID at Nazi soldiers in order to keep your cover. If you didn't, they'd become suspicious of you and then attempt to kill you. Fun game. You should check it out. Vietnam flashbacks Having not played MoH, neither do I :-/ I was really hoping that wasn't a typo... Well... the fact that it was repeated nine times is the joke. Bc when you played, you would just always show it and hope you're okay. So he didn't really repeat the joke. I posted this about 6 months ago, but I linked the MOH gameplay in the comments instead of starting the gif with it... So the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4higlo/i_stealthily_entered_my_house_medalofhonorstyle/) was removed early on for not being gaming-related. SHOW CREDENTIALS  Yes the girls in the middle and start weren't as hot as the end Son:  "This Dad-Joke Escapes me..."

Dad: "One day you will son, one day."
 Actually, I think it's more like "What the hell are you doing, Dad." "Dad's being weird again" . [](/ajfriends)My family sure is... Special. Your wife is a stranger to you? I know that feel man... I love how your son's face was just like "Dad wtf...?" That's not the only stealth tactic you're completing tonight  I don't know if this is an odd comment, but you can tell she loves you, and that warmed my heart. Frontline FTW You are a fucking boss Jon, you've got a beautiful family and home.  Treasure that shit brother. Where can i get one of these "wife" You are very lucky to have such an attractive wife and spacious house

edit: why did this get +80? I'm not trying to sound smarmy, just curious. It wasn't a cheeky joke or anything. Just a genuine compliment to a man's living situation.  your wife's a smoke show, see you on the front page bro I found the video very funny, but more importantly: your wife is gorgeous, your son is adorable, and even though he looks confused AF, you all seem very happy. I wish you all the best, /u/jontheboss. Is your wife single? [deleted] that girl looks like the blonde models in blacked.com

 Further proof that Wives approve of dad jokes. That was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time  The boy was not convinced.  Does she understand the reference or does she just think you're weird? I liked that you pushed her riiiight to the point of being just annoyed enough to playfully bat your hand away at the end.
   "Babe just open the door and act like a stranger"

"But wh-"

"LISTEN EMILY THERE AINT NO TIME TO EXPLAIN JUST DO IT" Im curious, does your wife know why you're doing this or does she just think you're a fuckin weirdo. Either way she seems to enjoy you:) what a douche, amirite? bragging and stuff Is she single?  Nice job on the wife situation Did she get the joke? Get on it, OP. We just made you a youtube celebrity. #!   
#!   
#!   
#!

 As would i.

Good luck OP; we're all counting on you. **#ripvine** From regular dude on D Day to OSS agent in a matter of weeks. you and me both. I loved that throughout the game you became more and more known. German soldiers would just yell out "Its jimmy patterson!" *machine gun sound* That's the real Eisenhower speech too tho. I'm up to 4 now? I'M RICH!

To celebrate, [here's me and my brother's more "popular" channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GeorgeBobTV/videos). o/ 6th And me your ~~5th!~~ 7th!.   *6 months later*

"Who else can we invite tonight... Maybe Jon?"

"Please no." I'd watch the hell out of this. Especially if he tried it at like private parties, or employee only type places. Absolutely a favorite game of mine which I'll never forget! I played it so many times and bought the soundtrack, because it really is the fantastic. I just wish I knew how I could play it again with no PS2/3 and only a Mac for a computer :( Op is this you

DAE THIS CLASSIC?  He's probably got his own Netflix and HBO Go accounts too. That piece of shit. Yeah he made a great choice by subscribing to Amazon Prime™! All you kids should definitely get an Amazon Prime™ subscription too! Wouldnt you want to be him? And he shops with Amazon Prime! Blatant advertising before the holidays. That a higher middle class house a person that is in the upper 1% would have double doors and the the rooms would be huge👌🏻 This guy fucks. She doesn't put up with it. She likes it.

That's what really hurts to see. Top grain from Horween, probably Goodyear welted and brings it to a shoe shine to polish it. Hey wait a minute i'm from Ohio....


*Looks at own username*

Oh.... me too thanks This shit and the speech are so fucking badass. It almost makes me wish I heard it live Chills everytime I read that, even as a kid you can't be stealthy if you're yelling ONE SHOT WELROD  D-Day Introduction to Frontline and Pearl Harbor Introduction in Rising Sun are some of the greatest missions in any shooter.

Unfortunately those events really happened though... Welp I know what I'm doing with Battlefield 1 when I get home today.  Arnhem Knights soundtrack is so underrated, if it was in a classic film it would be way more popular. AH-LAM! The bread is delicious. And hats off to the clock maker for making all those beautiful manor house pieces - really great stuff.    
&nbsp;    
Also, my sincerest apology for destroying every one of them. I love how it's the same cook the entire time. Like, during the manorhouse mission I'm not sure this is intentional or not but you can glitch/exploit the game to skip the guard calling you out. After that you're home free..Until you hit the chef. Yeah, apparently he isn't all that forgiving after that incident in the u-boat and will attack you, ruining your stealth experience.  I'm 25 :) I just had no idea why flashing the id at the toddler made me laugh so much You know, someone could be older than 18 and not have played this game.  I mean, I'm 16 and I get it. I'm 35 and had no idea what I was looking at.  Did not laugh. I think most of my friends have played this game and they're all 18, haha. No idea what game this is, am 25. Still laughed though. 

Nice condescension.  I'm 20 and played this shit endlessly.  Need to play it again.  I...I just copied and pasted from Google, also I feel like I could get into trouble if I called you a grammar nazi... Fahrvergnügen. Thanks for the info, sounds pretty cool!  Glad you did the re-post, pure Gold.   One day he will escape me? Dang, I'll have to work on that cage I've been meaning to build.

That took an unexpected turn. It always amazes me how quickly comment tangents start /r/2meirl4meirl Quit the crap and get me another juice box dad.  The look on the kid's face was my favorite part. I'm sure the kid's probably used to dad's antics by now. My wife passed away 5 months ago. I noticed as well. I would like someone to look at me that way some day.  he's got a good looking door, thats for sure Amazon. Didn't you see the box?  I found mine in Costa And Amazon boxes. And a wallet. And indoor plumbing. And a computer to play games on. And an offspring. nice meme The out-of-the-shower penis dance only works for so long, unfortunately.  Should i be afraid to look at this site?
 SNAKE?! SNAKE?! SNNNNAAAAAAAAAAKKKKEEEEEEEEE!! 

 wait are you telling me that's not how promotions work in the army? Haha that's only half the story. Supposedly he was a C-47 pilot for the airborne operation. If you've ever played MOH Airborne, you're flying in his plane. Patterson doesn't make an appearance, but his voice is heard just as your character jumps into combat. Somehow he made it all the way back to the invasion force and was put into a Higgins boat for the amphibious assault. The whole story is ridiculous, but they're all great games.  The Wikipedia on the game says this was originally not supposed to happen. You were to play as 2 different characters but in order to stream line the plot and eliminate confusion they made Patterson the character in the first level too even though it doesn't make sense.  Holy shit. That's Jimmy Patterson! Wait seriously? I don't remember that but that's fucking rad if true. Pretty stylistic design idea for an fps released in a time where they were starting to become pretty bland. Wait, seriously? I must have played this game a dozen times and never noticed this. Hell yeah. I knew it was a former pres but couldn't remember the name. I'm a turrible amurican  Dear Diary: Today OP was the best OH SHIT YOURE THE MEVRITHMITHRITHENOL GUY [I was going to subscribe but now I can't](http://i.imgur.com/1T92SSX.png) 6 Up to 5 now sir! Happy to be part of the nation. Oh yeah I've watched some of your stuff before. I believe you posted some to the /r/unknownvideos subreddit around when I posted my webseries. Mevrithmithrethenol is one of my favorite videos on youtube. More! You have "Medal of Honor'ed" your way into my heart. So I'll invite you. I have you tagged as "Medal of Honor stealth expert" I bet there's an actual bed in his house instead of a pile of refuse. I fucking hate OP and his smug fucking life.  I bet he doesn't even steal cable.  Fuck that guy.  I meant the 1% of people whose lives go according to plan. That house was a fixer-upper and small... We put a *ton* of DIY time into it, but it was an awesome first house which I shall forever miss. > rooms would be yuge

FTFY The original radio speech sounds far less...impressive than the intro version.  LEEEROOYYYYY JEEEENKINNNSSSSSS 1v1 me Battleship raiders bazookas only scrub Me and my 3 brothers would have Welrod only matches all the time. One shot kill but an infinite reloading time. That fucking gun...  I'm 32 and it didn't make that much sense to me, then again I never played that game. The joy of driving. Bloody Germans have a word for everything. No problem! It was on the PS2, but may be available for download somewhere. You really are a dad. *And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon...* Nah, one day in say, 16 years, you will be doing your best to help him escape. I aspire to become you People like you further cement the feeling that I want to be a dad someday. Good on you :)

Keep it up Pretty much no one is a stranger to your mom though. fun fact: [Strangers to Ourselves] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangers_to_Ourselves) is the title of the last album Modest Mouse has released. *Alright, who let Jaden Smith back on the internet?* I'm no stranger to that feeling. No Hold my penis!  I'm going in!   Thank *dooma gama ooma gama ga ga juice*

"WHO THE FUCK YOU THINK YOU TALKIN TO??" Fuck off son get your own juice box ya cheeky cunt  For real? Son of a bitch, i felt a feeling. Does that mean she's single?  I've always wanted to say that joke but could never muster the courage. Have an upvote That's a fucked up joke, man. I'd knock that. Honestly, I'm not even from a third-world country (Toronto, Ontario) and alot of those things I'd still be grateful for and will have to work very hard for. 

In the current direction my life is going, I'll be 30 years old and making $12/hr so I'll probably be living in a basement or something.

JESUS CHRIST THATS JASON BOURNE >OP was *the boss*. 

FTFY. It's in his handle, for Pete's sake.  Haha, yes! Can't believe you've seen it before... Did you see it on /r/unknownvideos? I bet he even washes with soap! Wait, there was a plan? Oh ok  you weren't specific and I was confused. Did it pass away 5 months ago? Cool man it seemed big in the video but you only saw the living room and the kitchen so it was impossible to tell. I just like dads being goofy around their kids, it warms my heart I've never realized how funny dad jokes were until now. He's reached his ultimate form.  *get the fuck out that's no longer your room* Hello darkness my old friend... That was dirty, cheap, and beneath you.

But in your defense, so is his mom. Depends on which direction she was facing at the time. I always enjoy it when the comments are somehow better than the top post that made it to the front page.

Nothing wrong with a basement home if you're happy.

Either way you're still screwed. Dank is so 2015. Oh so softcore?

Unless there's fisting or sizable livestock involved I just dont think "Whoa that's hardcore" any more 26? My friend needs a source. thank god it's not over 26 because that would've been fucked. do tear ducts count? For the last time, Abed, there are no other timelines!

##sixseasonsandamovie  Can you please explain to me why this became a meme?  >>OP was *the boss*. 

>FTFY. It's in his handle, for Jon's sake. 

FTFY, It's in his handle, for Shadowenx's sake. What's mevrmithinthonil I want to say yes, I'm pretty sure reddit sent me to it. But that was a quality video lol Holy shit, That's you?! I heard he got to have sex with his wife. At least once! Everyone starts with a plan but usually abandons it shortly after kindergarten. 

Remember that picture of a police man you drew in crayon on the "What I want to be when I grow up." paper? 

Of course you don't. Dude, you didn't get the plan? Sounds like you're on the No Plan plan and life is going according to plan  Crashing this plane! Everyone has a plan untill they get punched in the face We sold it and stealthed our way into a bigger house. You are become dad. When no one in the room is laughing like you are, you know you're hitting comedy gold, Dad.   No, my child... that has yet to reveal itself. Give him about 25~ish years, the The GrandDad shall emerge from its cocoon and reek on all who stand behind him. *"When you coming home Son?"*

...

*"Uhhh..."*  I've come to bang your mom again... [Oh...Its not for us.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSLmA3GihOk) I've come with broken arms again... Huh. That song is about prostitution, isn't it? I love Modest Mouse, and I was pretty disappointed.  If I'm being honest I love mid-90's to early-00's Modest Mouse, I guess, with The Lonesome Crowded West being the peak.  The last album (We Were Dead...) was ok, but this one is just sort of...bland?

I think it's just my age.  I'm 32 so those were impressionable years for me. Whole heartedly agree. Every song has its own personality. Shit in Your Cut, Coyotes, Sugar Boats, Of Course We Know are some of my favs. This album covers more of the issues with the world and shit, less personal issues from the early Mouse stuff which I miss.. but theyve gotten older so its expected Agreed. I really enjoyed it.  God damnit Jon, I felt like a piece of shit for a moment  http://i.imgur.com/BIx6i.gif "Hey guys! I just learned some sweet stealth tactics from Hitman."

"...In other unrelated news, yesterday my entire family plus any potential witnesses tragically perished in a series of freak accidents." Not a single NSFW post...  You da boss Double checked, OPs wife does not post on /r/gonewild. You're welcome! He makes the minimum? I actually live in a suburb around Toronto but I say Toronto for simplicity on the internet.  We are all screwed this blessed day. While the men are hung like sizable livestock, I haven't seen any with actual livestock. 

So yeah, pretty much soft core.  Pretty sure it violates some screen actors guild protections... 27 is just immoral, I agree.  The delivery of the line, the dark lighting illuminating the eyeballs, the transposability to endless zany scenarios make this meme legendary. The directors knew for a fact they were making a meme to go down in history.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YchaNqZvUb8 So I won't be a soccer player/astronaut? *checks e-mail*

Nope, just these coupons.  Good job. I wish you had done a video of you Medal of Honoring into your new home. In fact I would love to see you MoHing into various establishments e.g. bank, church Destroyer of jokes My kids just roll there eyes.  My 6 yr old gets frustrated with me,  stops talking and rolls her eyes when I tell dad jokes.  I think it's because being dad is the ultimate power trip and captive audience. The Night Mother is pretty smoking Because her fat folds softly reeking... Still heard this in the tone of Simon and Garfunkel. Thank you. haha All around me are familiar faces As you are in the corner softly weeping... Actually loled at work and people looked at me ... good job.  Have an upvote.   I feel like they just floated on this one You're absolutely correct, that album bites in a really depressing way. All if their most recent work just confirms that if you make good music on heroin, you're gonna have done difficulties when you get sober. Same here. They my favorite band from '98-'03. Saw them live in '01 and '02. It was great. I don't think they are the same. I think Isaac has calmed down a lot. When I saw them in OKC in '02 he cut the tops of his forearms with a knife half way through the show and bled the rest of the show. I don't think that's sustainable.  Strangers actually has the honor of being the album that debuted my least favorite song of all time, "Pistol". I hate that song more than anything I've ever heard, and I'm a fan of Gogol Bordello. Pistol was a steaming pile of shit from my favorite band of all time. On the other hand, I loved Ansel, Tortoise & The Tourist, Coyotes, Lampshades on Fire, The Best Room, and The Ground Walks With Time in a Box. It's not often I love *that* many songs off a single album from an artist I like. I don't think it was bad at all. And it has a sister album coming out in 2017. GOD DAMMIT JON Johns who lose the 'h' are not trustworthy. Now you've done it!

Quick Jon! HIDE! Does this Jon know something? Man this /u/jontheboss guy is a real jokster. My kind of fellow.
 Not so fresh under pressure now, are you? For a second, I thought you were the wife. The perfect gif. /r/retiredgif Dude spoilers... Lol, we *all* looked Yet... Let's Make Jon's Wife Wild Again: MJWWA Yeah still lol if you get a job at a Boston Pizza or something you'll be making more than that. I'm assuming you're young and/or in school or something.  I wish...  You both look so young! But you have a wife, a kid, and a nice house in the gif...

Back to feeling like I haven't done enough in life. 

Congrats on all of that. :) Nope! Hang on, I swear I had something for this Ok Cicero  On my penis she is choking Into leather, whips, and choking...

I don't think Isaac was ever involved in heroin, correct me if I'm wrong. damn really, i've never seen them live and never imagined they were anything close to that.

sounds more like a gg allin show or something YOU KNOW NOTHING GOD DAMN IT BARRY  Its true. The "H" stands for honest.  Jon Snow? Can confirm. Am a Jon with no h. I will deceive you.  Run, Barry. Run.  No For science, of course. No, if he gets a job at Boston Pizza he'll be making minimum wage, which is still under $12 an hour. J. Robert Pop-penheimer. [deleted] Brutus, is that you?

EDIT: The God of Speed in The Flash is actually Savitar. Ouch... *Half-Life 2: Episode Three* Just a friendly reminder that all of this started on the 3333rd day after Half-Life 2: Episode 2's release.

And the fact that Valve, once again, made a post on Twitter telling them to vote for Ricochet (which they've used Ricochet 2 as a code word for HL3's development) for an award.......and, then, just deleted the Tweet, outright.

Should we dust off our tinfoil hats *now* or later? I say why not?  Would be funny to see the turnout. Why didn't they name the Steam Awards 'The Steamies' I feel more proud for doing this than I did voting in the election Valve: "Wait, people want us to make another Half-Life?" I *think* they know. "GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL"  
https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/5ek6wg/psa_when_you_vote_for_halflife_2_episode_2_for/ [I got you](http://i.imgur.com/g1b7hV1.png). I remember when people started accepting that it was too late for episode three and started hoping for HL3.  http://store.steampowered.com/app/420/

Do it. Valve: We can't hear you over all this money we've made with micro transactions in TF2/CSGO/Dota2/Steam etc.  FRONT PAGE HERE WE COME I must say it proud, I did my good deed today. Spoiler: they know Half-Life HD 2.8 Remix, including Half-Life 0.2 and Half-Life 2: Episode 2.5 Yes. Link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/420/

Choose "the we didn't think of everything award" write in the blank below "game that deserves a sequel" Lets see if we can get a higher voter turnout than the election. Done Half-Life 2: Episode 2.0 + 0.5 Insemination to Sleep which you can (not) redo  But I want Portal 3 :/ "And the winner of the game that deserves a sequel is half li...uh.... Ricochet!" Dude, Valve knows. (But really, everybody do this. I did.) When they see these results they'll think "Oh yeah that game"  Shitpost this to the top! mission accomplished I feel like if/when they finally deliver. It's going to be a disappointment after all of the jokes through out the years. Or they will turn it into a quick cash grab as a yearly game.  I can't remember the interview of it or where the link was as it was literally like 8 years ago now but Gabe made a remark that Episode 1&2 were what Half Life 3 was suppose to be in story. The high demand for a sequel to be released so quickly is what made them turn it episodic and released as those two episodes and the Portal games, etc.. If they DO eventually release a HL3 it will be simply for continuing high demand and simply for the cash cow status and an all new story they had to create. Not the original one they planned.  Done. Valve already knows. I'm sure every single employee of Valve is absolutely sick of the thousands of HL3 jokes they must hear year after year.

Spoiler Alert: They haven't made it yet because when they DO make it, it'll have the same fate as Duke Nukem Forever where the extreme hype around the game will guarantee nothing could possibly live up to it, and the game will flop horribly taking a great series and dragging it's corpse through the mud. Just did it lol Done. I had already made a selection for that and was worried I couldn't change it. people already have died waiting for this... What's this? What's this?  
There's half life everywhere  
What's this?  
There's sequels in the air  
What's this?  
I can't believe my eyes  
I must be dreaming  
Wake up, Gordon, this isn't fair  
What's this?   bump I did my part! Like they don't know..... My favorite one was csgo for Russian dating Sim Because valve is unaware people want a sequel to their hugely popular, critically acclaimed flagship franchise.  I just want it to come out so ya'll will shut up about it.  Done and done. This is a perfect idea holy hell :D This shit came out 2007? Why does it feel like I've been hearing people ask for part three for way longer than that. I can see the announcement now:

Half-Life 3  

by

Wild Tangent To be fair, I'd rather they take forever to get the game right than listen to the hype train, do a cash grab, and have the community stuck with another no man's sky.  At this point, I don't really care if they never make a full length sequel. But the cliff hanger at the end of e2 is one of the most gut wrenching things never resolved. I care way less about the gameplay than I do the characters.  I posted this on Steam as well:   
  
>Make sure you save this review.

>If VALVE announces Half Life 3 production before the end of 2016, I will eat a Make America Great Again (MAGA)  hat and post the video on Youtube. 

>Don't think this announcement wont happen either, remember this is a year Trump got elected president and the Cubs won the world series. Yeah I'm sure the problem is that they just don't know.

Once we inform them surely we'll see some action! Never gonna happen. Never.  Geeze I just came here to post something like this myself and its already on the front page

http://puu.sh/ssomN/efeccb5575.jpg They already know. Honestly Im worried this is going to end up as Duke nukem. It's become such a idolized game series at this point I don't know if it could ever live up to expectations.  I'm sure valve has no idea that anyone wants a sequel. 

They probably think Half life was a complete failure. it's certainly not the game that they used to fund their current situation. /s It's not going to happen.

Valve are making money hand over fist as a distribution platform. There is zero reason for them to invest millions of dollars into a high risk game release.

They haven't published anything except some Linux ports in 4 years and even that was just a low risk low effort counterstrike release, and that's not likely to change.

Half Life is a property where no release could possibly live up to the hype and where the fan base is already aging out of the primary video Game market. honestly i don't get the huge outcry for an hl3. the first one was the good and the second one wasn't that interesting. i'd be more excited about a l4d3 or a tf3 that goes back to the less cartoony style of its roots. Lol. Cause Valve doesn't know Everyone just needs to give up on this. It was funny for a few years, but it is a little overblown now. Half Life 2 was AWESOME back in the day, but the amount of catching up to modern gaming Valve would have to do makes it way too big of a risk at this point. 
Even if it is awesome precisely because it uses old FPS trends, Valve would try to modernize Half Life to appeal to as many gamers as possible. Why spend millions on something that can never live up to the hype when you can make stupid amounts of cash selling other people's games? Done  Done. I voted Haven't we transitioned from "We need Episode 3" to "We need HL3" yet? Remember to make it all caps because it matters when you view it on the nominates page! Oh, they know. THEY KNOW I'm in. LET THIS HAPPEN PLEASE! Done. Never finished half life 2, but sure.  Wait a minute, do I need to play Half-Life 2: Episode 2 As well? I recently just bought them and am about half way through the first one.  You know I've never understood the excitement around Half life. 

Maybe it's time to give it a play. Does it hold up well? [We're doing it, reddit!](https://gyazo.com/90354043a9a7c2fe6a00c8fc4edfd619) Out of touch here and long over due question. Only played first one. Why does half life 3 matter? Damn. This isn't one of their pre defined awards. This won't get any traction. I'm upvoting this, but I should've downvoted because you're too late I feel weird in that I've been a lifelong gamer, knowing how to load and play games on my Commodore 64 before I was even in kindergarten, and yet I've never really been a fan of Half Life.

There has always been something about the camera and movement that has felt wrong to me. Yes because they don't already know. Not like you guys don't remind them ever 3 seconds  And then they still won't make it. They know. CLEARLY they know. Like they don't know already Wasting your time on HL3 No longer confident in their ability to deliver on HL3 even if they wanted to.  Fallout: New Vegas 2.  You know, I've never played Half Life before and see these things all the time on Reddit.  I'm guessing it's worth getting into even though it's been years since it was out?  I think they know, they just don't care. :( If you did this, make sure to upvote so we can keep a tally of all non-lurkers. Give OP the Karma he deserves. Half Life 2: Electric Boogaloo  Half-Life 2 Volume 2 I wouldn't be surprised if it's never made. There is going to be so much hype and expectation that I can only see mass disappointment, especially on this subreddit. Valve may not want to deal with the BS that comes with making the sequel; frustration, disappointment, and etc.   

 I can still hear that asshole administrator at the end, something like: *"Yes Dr Freeman, I know you made a small contribution, now about my amazing device..."* [HL3 TIMER RESET]

[HL3 TIMER RESET]

[HL3 TIMER RESET] I voted for it!  As you should too! Am I the only one who would rather have Portal 3? Updating my nominations, strength in numbers! lets do this bois! Knowing valve (at least those who are responsible for dota 2) if this game wins they'll actually go ahead and make the game, but than again dota 2 devs are really good. I actually forgot about half life 3 lol Does anyone have any ideas why they haven't made HL3 or episode 3 yet? In a series that fans were crazy for, it seems a little bit silly/dickish to just leave it at a cliffhanger and never make the sequel. Literally it would have printed money for them. It just seems almost disrespectful to me. In fact Valve barely puts out anything anymore. When orange box came out I fell in love with Valve and they were my favorite gaming company, and now they're just kind of irrelevant unless you're still playing TF2 or CSGO. Please do it to the actual game rather than the expansion though lol We've heard there demands and so we are proud to announce, "Half Life 2: Episode 2.5 Final Mix" If Valve/steam is a bit trolly, they will change that episode two with episode three and some parts of the internet will erupt. You're wrong.  Valkyria Chronicles is the correct answer. Sequels aside... 10 Oct 2007... Jesus fuck it's been 9 years already. I went with The "I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye" Award.  Halflife 3: you gave us too much money. We rich now, no need make more games.  Right, THIS is going to let valve know we want Half Life 3. They would have no idea otherwise, no one has said anything! Episode 3 is delayed one month per each nomination.  What if Valve has writer's block and is trying to protect us from a bad sequel? Never played the game, does it stand the test of time? Can someone explain to me why Valve has stopped making good games like their portal series? 

Are they just satisfied with their Steam, Dota 2, TF2 and CS:GO making their cash to even care about being the game developer we once loved during the HL, Portal and even their L4D days?  Half a generarion cmon. Its only ten years. I play videogames for 38 years now. Still dissapointed by the ending of Mission Impossible. You guys dont understand
If they fuck up Half Life 3,
They fuck up big time!
just imagine all the hate that would be going on in every related subreddit 
It would be 10 times worse than no mans sky  o.o
 Valve should title the third one "episode 4". Then they don't have to use three, since they're scared of that number. I honestly don't get how a company as big as Valve and an IP as big as Half-Life hasn't got another sequel after this long.  They haven't even had a rumor of it being slightly worked on or thought about.

Especially considering they CLEARLY meant for it to keep being an ongoing property given how it was left off.... I just don't get how it got dropped like it did. you want half life 2 episode two, two? I'm joining Never played it, any good? Let them know what? That people want more Half-Life?

That's a wasted nomination. They already know. Half Life 2: Episode 3 How many people immediately went and did this cuz screw Valve for abandoning a series like that, and then after submitting it, it read...

The THE "GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL" AWARD Award ?

Ohh... ^just ^me?

 *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two*  I wouldn't care, at least we can get some closure after that damn cliffhanger Half-Life 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue Half-life 2S: 2 and a Half Life That is what half life 3 has always been. The hype was always about episode three. After awhile people just started referring to it as half life 3 Wouldn't even be mad. There were supposed to be 3 episodes to HL2 anyways. I'd be totally down with that. Such a setup for Ep 3 at the end of Ep 2. Nobody has said the most obvious one yet...

HALF-LIFE2:EPISODE ....TWO REMASTERED 


WOOOOOOOO Are you saying what I think you're saying? Valve a post on Twitter? Can I have a link for that? Can you write this on a chalkboard? I wouldn't mind a Ricochet 2. Or at least people actually playing Ricochet. Can I have a source on that tweet? Any screenshots or archived? Thanks for sharing! Surely THIS hint towards HL3 is legit, unlike the hundreds of others. This will be a meme that will still be a thing in 50 years.  
I don't see it ever actually happening :P The fact that they deleted it makes me think they intended it to be a joke and then realized it was probably in poor taste for their image, since they don't actually intend to ever make HL3. Like a "Haha, I'm just jerkin' your chain" type of thing. http://i.imgur.com/hy9yiN0.gifv THEY'RE FUCKING WITH US AND IT'S MAKING ME UPSET. I personally never allow my tinfoil hat to get Dusty. Yeah, legit curious about this I did it! I nominate No Man's Sky, that was a big ol Steamie. Or the "steamers" room in that boat for me? You've narrowed the amount of pride for this Steam vote down to any whatsoever. I remember going to work that morning pissed that I had to pick between the two of those idiots for the White House.  It's now even sadder that, as you said, this does make me far more proud. But you'll probably be just as disappointed with the end result. :( How long has this been going on without us noticing?! But how will they sell funny looking hats and weapon sprays in a single player game? "THAT old game?? Well... if that's what they want... This could be an opportunity to make a few bucks... maybe a Half-Life platformer? Or a Half-Life match-three-gems cellphone game? C'mon people, let's brainstorm! Think "micro-payments"! And DLC's!" #LET THEM KNOW MORE  Thank you, there was a kitten on my chest when i saw his thread and you made it so i didn't have to disturb him via mouse copy paste.

DUDE

WEED

LMAO /r/trees I just did and told my friends to do as well. > app/420/

Blaze it Dude lol your username
 Don't let your dreams be dreams Today !? You did the deed of the mouth !  yeah but having them have to give an award for it will be tres ironic Spoiler: and it has been delayed for VR.  At least we'd be getting something that advances the plot.  DX Directors Cut Featuring Dante From the Devil May Cry Series and Knuckles as a fan of kingdom hears and half life.. i fucking hate your comment so much right now.  You mean Portal 2: Episode 1? 5 bucks Portal 3 *is* halflife 3
 Half Portal: Life 3.0 They are saving that for the aptly named Blue Box, TF3 L4D3 HL3 and Portal 3 I think the portal series is done, really nothing more can be done with the story. Unless its a prequal I liked how it ended, so a prequel would be nice. That's what I thought the new Doom was going to be, but alas it is actually badass *and* true to the original. They *can* deliver, they just don't want to. They'd have to practically re-imagine the mechanics as well. It's been ten years since Ep 2, and the fps genre has made several huge advancements that are automatic must-haves in any shooter of the modern era. So now instead of just adding to the story/environment for a sequel, they have to dig deep into the core game and make some key updates. This would not have been a problem had a new game been released closer to the others. Sure there's hype, but a lot of the demands for release aren't that we want some amazing, groundbreaking game that will do exactly what the past installments did. We just want the damn story finished.

There's already been plenty of comparisons, but some great ones would be Lucas not releasing Episode VI, or even J.K. Rowling never publishing the last book of the Harry Potter series.

If Valve was really worried about the hype killing the game, they could have at least "leaked" the story's ending, or found SOME way to give closure to those who are still waiting for the resolution of the cliffhanger that was HL2: Episode 2. It's their own fault. They're not even releasing a "*when* *it's* *done*" statement anymore. Or even a "*we're* *still* *working* *on* *it*". No information and no regard for fans, some of whom have probably died in the interim.

So I hope that these constant jokes bug them a bit. You should change yours.  Even if the *game* doesn't live up to expectations, at least we'll finally get a book-end to the story.

And not be left with **another fucking cliffhanger**. There is no risk involved. The Half-Life name alone will guarantee huge profit.   i don't care, i just want it. outsource it to some other company, hell fucking sell the IP if you don't want to do anything with it. Closure is more important than anything.   
also a lot of that aging fan base can literally afford to buy a high end valve branded gaming pc just to play this game(and will really want to). hell people are hyped for the PREY reboot(a game that came out a decade ago), The last guardian(sequel to a game that came out a decade ago),Shenmue 3, Zelda(this one isn't fair but it is a very old and beloved franchise). These are literally machine seller games, hype levels set to 11 High risk? Everyone would buy it The outcry is just that they want a damn ending to the story at the very least. Imagine the outcry if J.K. Rowling had never published Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows. Or maybe Lucasfilm never releasing Episode VI of Star Wars. Can you imagine the shitstorm there would have been? 10 years, a remaster, and a spinoff getting a sequel says they don't. they *almost* get it, but they dont. > Why spend millions on something that can never live up to the hype when you can make stupid amounts of cash selling other people's games?

Because you are making stupid amounts of cash selling other people's games. 

Just see how much they spent making the vive over the years, the steam machines and that controller, you think they give a single fucking fuck about cash? They could've made a random generic as fuck design in each of them and get sure money, guess what: THEY TRIED SOMETHING RETARDEDLY DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE INSTEAD TO THE POINT THAT IT BACKFIRED HARD ON THEM

They got to where they are by innovating and challenging themselves, I'm sure they can make a fucking fps.  If they didn't keep bringing it up and/or gave us a straight answer, we would've stopped a long time ago.

But, Valve seems pretty adamant about keeping this on the "hype backburner", so to speak.

If anything, the *least* that this'll do is maybe get us a straight answer. Or not.

It's just fun, either way. I just want them to finish the story :( I'd be super happy if it was just the same general gameplay as HL2 and the two episodes and just concluded things.

If we got more I'd love that too of course, but I don't want that holding the prospects for the game back. That's the same as giving up. As of now, yes. In order to get yourself caught up to the end.

But, be warned: the ending of Episode 2's a doozy. Only then will you understand our pain. Graphics are dated, and it feels very different from modern games, but it's still an enjoyable shooter. Well not just that, but the fact that the story is unfinished, currently ended on a cliffhanger, is the main reason people want HL3. The experience and feeling it leaves you with is really something words cannot describe. The story was also written very well, it never left me bored. Definitely. Been replaying through the series and the only one that really looks that outdated is the original Half-Life. Yes its brilliant. The game revolutionized the FPS industry with its techniques of storytelling, fun level design and atmosphere. I highy recommend it. Downvoted for the truth.  This is just for a bit of fun *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Part One* Electric Boogaloo.  *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Act Two*  Especially after almost ten years.  Yeah I don't see why I should care what they name it  Good someone else caring about closure... All I see everyone talk about is HL3... I want to know how HL2 ends first not start a new story. "For realsies this time, this is the last one, then it's KH3"

Half-life 0.2: Final Chapter Prologue Prolapse Half-Life 2T *new* half life 2: episode2 Actually Valve stated that Episode 3 would be it's own title.  It was what we originally expected as Valve themselves had announced it would be a three part expansion on two. Later they clarified that the episodic content was not ideal and they did not intend to continue it, so people just shifted the focus to a theoretical HL3 instead of Episode 3. Believe it, Star Child. In a world where the Cubs have won the world series... Donald trump was elected the president... A dead Gorilla was the omen to start it all... and all of the other crazy shit in 2016...

I feel like anything is possible. Half-Life 3 confirmed. Ricochet 2 confirmed. It is as irrational to reject all conspiracy theories as it is to accept them. - Abradolf Lincler Valve likes making jokes that we take way out of context because nobody is interested in finishing the project right now? The Tweet got deleted, but, here was the thread from when it went live.

https://np.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/5eit1d/valve_announcing_the_autumn_sale_2016_and/?st=IVVRM5SK&amp;sh=727d239f It's deleted now, not sure if anyone archived it I've played it once. Wait, in my timeline Ricochet is a series of Breakout clones made by Reflexive in the early 2000s. Which Ricochet are we speaking of? Ricochet in VR would be the tits Think about that.

What dick of a Valve employee would post something like that as a joke, especially when we *know* its sequel has been used as a code word for HL3, a game which we've been waiting for for **10** years?

If that is the case, I hope that guy got a serious talking to by his higher-ups for pulling something like that. Never played the game, and I have no current interest in playing it.

But I voted anyway, just to see what will happen. Me too! > No Man's Sky

I'm not crying, there's something in my eyes Why about to have a party here? Women and children first. I remember seeing a ballot sheet image on here. It showed there were other candidates. Why didn't you look up them to decide if they would have been a better choice. At least we know who to blame when shit hits the fan now. No more bickering over who should be elected, just bickering over how much the President fucked up. Why? Just why? Another half life? That's make no sense!  Why aren't you posting pictures of that kitten right now? You can't bring up that a kitty is just chilling on your chest and not show us a photo.  Where u goin in a few? Wait a minute... [Ditto!](https://i.imgur.com/g1b7hV1.png) I dont know my steam login (on mobile) so it took me like 10 minutes to get logged in. Then this wasnt a default option so i had to come back to reddit and search for this post to get the exact wording.

And after all that, it said "there was an error saving your changes, try again later".

So fuck your optimism!  Not only have I taken more time to read this *and* comment, but I'll forget to vote. my internet's too slow to open steam, so I can't vote.

:/ Copy+Paste actually seemed to not register when I put it in and clicked save. It worked after backspacing the L and then putting it back though.  my longest ayyyyy ever /app/420/blazeit No wonder a sequel hasn't come out. They're too baked.  ..."the prequel. What exactly did Gordon do before the resonance cascade? This game explores the life of a Black Mesa employee running highly advanced tests. Valve presents: The Gordon Parable." At least we have KH3 to look forward to. KH3 (only took a decade!) before HL3...what a mad world we live in. It's as easy as 1, 2, 2: Episode 1 I'd play it. Portal is fucking awesome. 


Everything you figure out the puzzle you think to yourself "holy shit, that was actually simple" 

The creators did a damn good job I'll make it ten. 

And on the subject of the combination of the two I really wish that valve would have cooperated with the makers of Super Hot to make three different sci-fi technology style games each with 2 games of their own then joining them all in an epic third game!

If you don't know what Super Hot is, it's a shooter style game where time only moves when you move.
The 3 games together would make for an epic Space, Gravity, and Time bending Conclusion! I literally went from smiling at this thread to shocked in 0.5 seconds when I read this. Halflife 3: A portal story. Would they?

The last Half Life game came out almost a decade ago. What happens when it doesn't meet people's expectations and everyone shits on it. What's the market like for a story based shooter with a railroad plotline today? Making a game like half-life is hard, hence the risk.

If it flops or even gets shitty reviews, it'll do more damage than good, and Valve don't need to take that risk. Oh. I just assumed people really liked it and wanted more. Not that they were looking fa conclusion. 

Now I totally understand why people want it. Kinda like people with their Firefly. *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Part One / Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Part One-2 HD Remaster Bundle* Careful now, we're straying into Kingdom Hearts territory.  *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Part One: Section Two* https://youtu.be/9Sjk3f4qC1I ... of two. *Half-life 2: Episode 3: Episode 2 Remastered* _Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Act Two: Electric Boogaloo_ You'll end up playing as Gordon and Alyx's 10 yr old, and you'll have to put the pieces together. Your sidekick will be this old woman in orange pants with a funny gun that makes holes in things. How many gamers have died in those ten years, waiting for closure from one of the most beloved video game series in history?

I am being entirely serious here; there has to have been a large number of players who were huge Half Life fans and have since died while patiently waiting for the finale. Almost half a generation has passed since Valve has decided they don't want to deal with it and would rather greenlight shitty pre-alpha games that don't work.

Valve isn't required to finish anything--but it's still a dick move. Wow I didn't realize it had been that long... Half-life 2 came out almost 13 years ago. I hope they make the game before Gordon's VA dies :( I've sunk so much money into KH and still no 3, BUT DONT WORRY WE HAVE 2.8 AND A 1.5&2.5 PS4 BUNDLE COMING BECAUSE FUCK YOU GIVE US MORE MONEY Now in gunmetal grey! Then they laughed and laughed and laughed. Indeed, in May of 2011 http://www.develop-online.net/analysis/the-valve-manifesto/0117024 Gabe confirmed that Valve had shifted to "entertainment as a service" (and away from the short episode cycle they had intended to do beyond ep1 and ep2)
 I want to believe Ok I need to know the only time I've heard anyone say star child was Hippie related OR Steven Universe. I need clarification on which you're referencing for my sanity You rang? ;) >I feel like anything is possible.


Except Half-Life 3. Leo won an Oscar. Half Life 3 drops 2016 and Daft Punk announces a NA tour as well. 

Everything that could have happened in 2016 would have happened. 

 Isn't that another 10 years??? FFS!! Ah, the bi-annual "HL3 confirmed" hype.  The only three sure things in life.  Death, taxes, half-life 3. Imagine an actual confirmation. Nobody will believe them until they release...  http://archive.is/GImvi Update: the original tweet was found.

When you type in that link, it leads to the Rocochet homepage.

When they reuploaded the Tweet, it was just the store.steampowered.com homepage.

That also begs the question of how they mistook Ricochet for the Steam Store, if this somehow *isn't* related to HL3, but.......that's another story, altogether. That is where my mind went too when I heard "Ricochet." Ricochet was a MOD that came out around the same time as old half life death match and counter strike 1.6, if I recall (I only played it once) it was like that disc throwing bizz from Tron. Where you bounce a Frisbee off shit to kill people. Half Life 2 along with both of the episodes is a total of $5.17 on the Autumn sale right now if you do decide to give it a shot! Please do! Or get into the lore, or watch a playthrough. It's really a testament to Valve's narrative capabilities.  You're gonna wanna play this. Its really a good game Play it.  Then you'll understand why this is funny.  And frustrating. It's a great game that still holds up! I hope you're not joking, go ahead and try it. Myself and most of my friends are not big video game players and even the ones that hate video games or only play the sport games absolutely loved it from the first 10 minutes and couldn't stop playing until it's over. Thanks! "No Man's Cry" >Why about to have a party here?

Because party here where is. Naw I'm not in the band Lost Prophets Because with a two party system the other choices have literally no chance of winning.  This makes it a better option for us to vote for the lesser of two dipshits Gabe Newell: We wrapped it up so perfectly in half life 3, and no one even bought it!

Assistant: *whispers to Gabe*

Gabe Newel: What do you mean we never released it! Can't take picture.  Kitten on chest. Wait a minute... Something's not quite right... 9 years Ooh, can we get the same narrator as The Stanley Parable while we're at it? Maybe he and G-Man arguing at one point? This is the story of a man named Gordon.

Gordon worked for a company in a big research facility where he was Scientist #427. Scientist #427's job was simple: he stood at his anti-mass spectrometer in room 427 and he pushed crystals on a cart. Orders came to him through a speaker on the wall, telling him what crystals to push, how far to push them, and in what order. This is what Scientist #427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending, Gordon relished every moment the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Gordon was happy. It follows the syllable stress of the song too. Yeap, that's why I nom'd Portal 2 for The “Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!” Award.

I also nom'd Portal 1 for The “Villain Most In Need Of A Hug” Award because GLaDOS is such a tragic villain. Totally misunderstood.  Combination?? More like Combine Nation.  Superhot is fun for exactly three hours I mean we all caught the ice breaker ship reference right? Imagine Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows never being published.

Yeah. & Knuckles  Half-Life 3: Jumanji Now in Lego *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Part One / Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Part One-2 HD Remaster Bundle GOTY Edition* *Half-Life 2: Mom's Spaghetti*  now with day one DLC! and get Gordon Freeman's special Albert Einstein and Neil de Grasse Tyson costumes when you pre-order now at GameStop! Nah, we haven't gotten into fucking fractions yet.  Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Chain of Headcrabs ill believe that when they make an episode focused around a random word and how much of the plot they can substitute with it _Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Act Two: Electric Boogaloo: The Sequel!_ > a funny gun that makes holes in things

So... a gun? The fact that this could fit into the real world timeline makes me sad. All you'll be getting is holes!  And she never speaks. She just jumps when you ask her a question. An example would be kitty0706. I was afraid I'd die before finding out the ending for Lost. Disappointed... Valve is secretly run by George RR Martin. That's the piece you're missing. Could be worse, they could shit out a cheap cash grab *cough*Duke Nukem Forever*cough*. Its a weird departure from the series....no word, nothing just a cliff hanger no episode 3 with no news from the studio.  Everything is silent no word, they just dropped it!....yet they keep holding on to the licence.  Do they have plans, did they get scared and realize we can never live up to the hype?  Why are there hints every now and then that there will be a hl3...like the hl3.exe thing and all the little shit they put in their hl related games. 

 Alot of people would say they owe us nothing and they should not make the game because we demand it.....I would say otherwise!!!  We put them on the map!!! They made the game sure but we made them famous and made them rich.  The valve empire was built on HL  and if it wasn't for that they would not be where they are today.  So really I think they fucking owe us big time and that we deserve HL3!!!  If not then release the license and let the fans finish the game themselves. It's been exactly 3333 days since HL2EP2 released. Ehh, I'd love to hear his voice again :( I haven't played a KH game in ages. 

They are actual games though, right? Like 2.8 and 1.9 aren't just updated versions, they're completely new titles?  I waited basically a decade to get into KH and figured 1.5 and 2.5 HD would be the super duper final edition - but nope cock blocked by 2.8. Who the fuck comes up with this system The fact that I'm super hyped for 1.5+2.5 scares me. Nomura has me by the balls, and I do not mind. And went back to designing more cs:go cases. Three laughs? Thats a bit much for valve. inb4 "No Man's Half-Life 3, directed by Sean Murray." *DON'T STOP BELIEVING* That would be Steven Universe, my friend.

Good eye. I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thought Steven Universe. We may have lost a lot of celebrities, but by glob we still have our vaporware! ~~Cubs win world Series~~  

~~Donald Trump elected President, under budget and ahead of schedule~~  

Half-life Life 3 released in 2016?   

I would not be surprised. No I clearly remember this happening last year multiple times during convention season and such

I wouldnt be surprised if next year the top post on /r/gaming

"Gabe Newell takes a shit, his first solid one in years, and how many pieces were left behind in the toilet??? 3" I would buy lotto cause anything can happen in 2016

I mean we got Red dead redemption 2 Someone had the wrong link in their clipboard. Happens when I try to send my mom a google maps link but it's accidentally porn from before Definitely definitely earlier than 1.6

Edit: 2.5 years early. CS1.6 was when steam started. Ricochet was when CS is just out of beta.
  there was a period of time where you couldn't sneeze on steam without getting a copy of two of hl2. Orange box, l4d, i think it was a complementary gift when gifts were first things.

I probably gave away 3-4 copies of HL2 that I never recalled buying. Waiting for half life 2 and 3 GOTY edition after it's 2 bucks and playable on winlinux 74 Here's the thing though, is it actually worth playing since it is story rich game but it ends on a cliff hanger? This is what has made me not to touch the series... Yeah I never had any interest in any of the half life stuff, but I was able to pick up the orange box on 360 for like $5. I started playing and didn't stop for a good eight hours. I haven't had that happen with a game in a long time.  Yes do ya I need more kinds of these funny english. Where can I find it in google? I understand what you're saying, but if a third party gets at least 5% of the popular vote, it receives federal funding, which could start to move it into a larger position of power. It is a two party system because of attitudes like this. I wouldn't put it past them Don't give them ideas. They'll release that as a 'joke' video then not say anything for 5 years. Jordan, you had one job! bruh don't start that "how did you take this picture" nonsense http://i.imgur.com/MJigeJl.gif [Wait a minute...](https://youtu.be/pocINhHymFg?t=31) good thing i drank some water beforehand Care to expand on that? I'm assuming you've played half life 2 also? I've only played up to that big as leviathan thing on half life 1, and only portal 2. Should I see what all the damn hypes about for once?  Combine Nation?? More like calm by nature. All hail our larval overlords, our benefactors Herecy. DLC #1: "Tails" The Miles Prower Story Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series! This had me dying The Half-Life.  358/2 Days has to be one of the most obnoxious game titles ever. The Human Headcrabapede? I snorted hard at that To be fair chain of memories was super fun and intuitive *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Act Two: Electric Boogaloo: The Sequel & Knuckles* Those ones aren't funny.

Unless you're in a Tarantino universe. Not bullet holes, but-- don't worry, you'll figure it out. not bullet holes, but... Don't worry. You'll figure it out. Portal 2 is like ~~millions~~ thousands of years after the events of half life.  Holes... In you, not me! UBELMAAT ;)

HL3: A lesbian, paedophilic, love story. Background info? Fuck, I never knew he died. I remember watching the Adventures of G-man years ago ;_; But you did die. That ending is part of your purgatory. And waiting for Half-life 3 is another.  It's not like the entire show wasn't building up to that let down. I bailed in the 5th season because it was obvious they were cramming in so many 'mysteries' that they would never explain and manipulating the audience into tuning in each week. If it was 'shit out', that was some next-level constipation. Age of empires: castle siege :( H-h-half Life 3 co-confirmed...? no, they are a collection of previous titles, some as full games other as cutscene only "movies" I remember when I thought that series was good. Then they made 6.4 games across 9 platforms.  Well tbh 2.8 is another collection with the games they didn't include with 1.5 and 2.5, but yeah, they should really stop wasting time. more like dota2 updates  

cs needs more love :((((((((((((((( After all this time I would be fine with that, I just want to play the fucking game that's all. So at the end of episode 3 you just go back to the beginning of half life?  So we've already seen the ending and we don't even know it?! Ok thank you I like SU a lot so it's always good to see a redeem even if it to a less than savory character I just bing watched all of season 2 so it's kinda on the brain lol Even for 2016 it's a stretch  What heathen stores that in their clipboard? Good point, but who would jack of to Ricochet? Same and I still haven't gotten around to playing it I still have that copy.  It's been in my inventory for years. The nuclear winter sale. Fuck ya, that's always awesome  Federal funding isn't going to change anything as long as the third parties keep nominating terrible candidates that 95% of the voters don't want to be President.  Jill Stein was just a complete joke.  You can't blame the "mainstream media" for her AMA being a dumpster fire of retardation.  I was hopeful that Gary Johnson was going to get some real traction since he had a legit resume, and he just blew it horribly.

Third parties need to take the slow and boring route, and focus on mayoral and state legislature races in favorable areas.  If those people are successful, they can run for higher offices.   Then maybe some of them should get real about things like their platform, or whom they nominate. America's other options included Gary Johnson, a cartoon character who can't find Syria on a map, and Jill Stein, a university trained MD who supports homeopathy and antivaxxers, not because she believes in those things, but because she wants their votes. I mean Ross Perot had 19%, didn't really change much  She didn't *ask* to become a homicidal AI. She just got bored because everyone was dead! Yes, I've played all of the HL series, including Blue Shift and Opposing Force. It's all fantastic. 

The Portal series is a totally different ball game, but equally fantastic. I love things that drip with sarcasm. 

Of course I might be biased. I grew up on FPS games in the 90s. It's the genre I most identify with. DLC #1: "Tails" The Miles Prower Story Ep. 2 Part 2: Electric Boogaloo I've been playing sonic games for 12 or so years... I just realized his name is Miles Per Hour I don't get this one... Now 90% off on Steam Feat. Pharrell  Developed by Hello Games 2.8 Final Chapter Prolougue Ultra Climax Chronophantasma Extend Alpha Version 3 - Burning passion lighting the world on fire F Did you get better? Half-Life: Tokyo Drift Half Life 1 [deleted] I dunno, I kinda liked it when I found out what it meant. The entire game revolves around 2 characters and the experiences they had over the course of 358 days. And it's pronounced "three fifty-eight days over two" for some ffffffucking stupid reason.

(I didn't hate the game like everyone else, though, so there's that.) *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Act Two: Electric Boogaloo: The Sequel & Knuckles: Scene Two* Then they're HILARIOUS Why wouldn't you expect to be? Sharp objects are fun in Tarantino universe too! What? It's set before Half Life I'm pretty certain. Although Chel is in cryo sleep for ages, the Borealis is still at Aperture labs instead of wrecked in the Snow like it is in Half Life.  millions?  no. *not my... FTFY Popular Gmod animator that died from complications with leukemia. While DNF had been "In development" for 14 years, once Gearbox Software acquired the rights, they released the game after 9 months (which is longer than I'd remembered).  Basically Gearbox bought the rights because they knew they'd have an IP with 14 years of free advertising, so they didn't need to put any effort into it to cash in.

So I guess it was more like getting a fecal transplant from someone with constipation, only to get diarrhea?  I don't think this metaphor really holds up. S-s... seriously? 

Isn't there a new KH game coming out? Is it just another re-release or is it an actual new game? And just to be clear, then... the only KH games (full games) are 1 and 2? This whole time I've thought I was missing out.  At least Valve remembered they made CS:GO.  With TF2 they just kicked it into a corner and told it to stop whimpering. That's the magic of Icefrog, not Valve as a whole.  I just want the fucking ending, they could make pong with a cutscene at the end and I'd be satisfied  I just want ricochet source 2.0 Trust me. I don't like Marty anymore than you do.

But, I just couldn't resist the quote...... The "clipboard" is just where things go when you copy them, for copying and pasting. Play it. Last Saturday I beat it for the first time. Despite it's age, it was fricken awesome. I got through HL2 but it never really grabbed me. Maybe that has something to do with it being one of the first FPS games I ever played, and me being absolutely god awful at it even with cheats on. I think I started episode 1 but never finished it. I should redownload that and play it I'll take it lol
 Thank you.   > Third parties need to take the slow and boring route, and focus on mayoral and state legislature races in favorable areas.

This is how the radical Christian right did it, and look at where they are now. i spent like 5 minutes researching Gary Johnson before i realized he's a joke of a candidate who's living 40 years in the past. Ross Perot allowed Bill Clinton to win the presidency because of the split conservative vote. She was also forced into it by Cave Johnson.... Na I'm around your age, half life 1 was the first pc game I've ever played. I actually think I bought it at Kmart Hahaha. I guess I'll have to talk some time out of my day and play some games. It's been a while. Thanks buddy  Wow insert face palm png Knuckles is a character from the Sonic series of games, as is Tails, AKA Miles Prower. ma0474 added "& Knuckles" to Sturatos' title in reference to Sonic & Knuckles, the Sega Genesis game. Alfalfa_Centauri commented "DLC #1: 'Tails' The Miles Prower Story," implying that they would create a DLC about Tails in a game because it features other characters from the Sonic franchise. $0.12 Are you a horse? Nope, rip semmball Half Life: 3T Will sea salt ice cream help? Ok then shouldn't it be 358 daysX2? Yeah, that is literally the least interesting or descriptive thing I can imagine tho.

Wait.... Am I whooshing? Is that the joke? I can never tell... I mean they still could have gone for something more stylistic like "Our Year Together" or "Counted Days" perhaps "The Sharing Days" (because engrish), maybe even "2 characters 1 year (NSFW)"  *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Act Two: Electric Boogaloo: The Sequel & Knuckles: Scene Two With a Vengence*

 Oh man, I shot Marvin in the face. Less conversations about the true meaning of some songs being about big dicks. I thought the Borealis drydock was empty in Portal 2?

\*checks youtube\* [Yeah, the Borealis is gone, there's just an empty drydock and a lifesaver with "Borealis" on it.](https://youtu.be/PVbqOwh2s3M?t=39)

Portal is set after the invasion (which may be part of the cause of GladOS's psychosis, since part of her motivations seem to be continuing to hide while manufacturing defensive weapons), and Portal 2 is set a long time after that. It wasn't still at Aperture. In Portal 2 you find the empty docking bay, after the ship disappeared. It obviously disappeared before they closed of that portion of Aperture labs, which was implied to be quite a while before the game started. Googled. 273 years, or 27300. People would prefer to believe 273. But one of the devs mentioned wanting it to be some 50,000 years later. So 27300 according to the counter is probably the best answer. No there are more than 1 and 2 it's just those are the only main series games. All of the spin offs are canon though so to be able to jump into 3 you have to play them. In chronological order it's Unchained (which is a mobile app, but in 2.8 there will be a lore movie about it), Birth by Sleep, 0.2 (which is in 2.8 and is a sequel to birth by sleep), 1, Chain of Memories, 358/2 Days (which actually starts at the end of 1 and goes past Chain of memories), 2, Re:Coded, Dream Drop Distance, and then 3. 358/2 days and Re:Coded are on 1.5 and 2.5 but as cutscene movies.  Actually you basically miss out on the story.

Literally all of them are important with birth by sleep and dream drop distance basically being a main series game in everything but name.

Really kh1/2, is less "this is the main game" and more "these ones are about sora"

Also 2.8 is kinda the ground zeroes of kh3 since it has that new chapter that runs on the kh3 engine. I don't know what he's talking about, there *will* be a new game in 2.8 along with the older games. It won't be a terribly long game, but it will serve as a sort of prologue for KH3. The developers said they were originally going to just put it in KH3 as the actual prologue but it got too big so they made it its own game and put it in the 2.8 collection along with the HD re-release of the older games.

KH1 and KH2 are the main games about Sora. KH:3D (Dream Drop Distance) is set after KH2 but before KH3. It's also mostly a game about Sora but it also has a heavy emphasis on Riku. It continues the main plot though so it technically should have been KH3. But they didn't want KH3 to be on a handheld so they made KH:3D a sort of in-between story.

Chain of Memories and 358/2 Days both take place between KH1 and KH2. They serve to explain the origin of Roxas and his story. We also get introduced to Axel and the bad guys of KH2 in these games.

Birth by Sleep takes place before KH1 and it follows a group of 3 keyblade warriors. The main bad guy for the entire series gets revealed here and the events of the rest of the games get put into motion here. This game is the most story focused one so far and is absolutely critical to understand the series.

Unchained takes place long before Birth by Sleep. Its purpose is to shed some light on mysterious events from the past we previously knew little about, such as the Keyblade War.

Every game in the series is important. It's just that the only games with a main number (1, 2, and 3) are the ones specifically about Sora and his efforts against the main bad guy. The other games either focus on other protagonists or it's Sora but he's not continuing the main fight against the main bad guy. For example, the bad guy in Chain of Memories is Marluxia, someone not a part of the main bad guy's plans. Therefore CoM isn't a numbered title.    Is TF2 still a thing since OverWatch came out? TF2 was artificially kept alive long past its natural death.  To be fair, the game came out in 2007. They've honestly done a pretty good job supporting the game, especially since making it F2P. Don't say that Oh no I don't blame you, it's just Marty makes me want to dump him on the island of the coconut Stevens ya know? I just did my like 5-6 play through total, I wish I could play through for the first time that would be amazing.  Alex Vance is still, to this day, my \#1 AI companion in any game. It has aged phenomenally well.  I didn't know who miles was! Thanks for clearing it up! $0.12% dollars off sale now! Yeah he's mine.. Don't know how he got out... I assume the only appropriate response is "neigh" What types of Romans are there, exactly? Neigh, I am not a horse He's not actually a horse... he's a broom. No, you're right.  If it's 358 days experienced twice, it should be x 2.

It's dumb. I always thought it was 358 and a half days. Just to be mildly poetic.  It wasn't the most creative title, sure, but people act like they just made it up out of nowhere. It has an explanation, no matter how lackluster people think that explanation is. Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Act Two: Electric Boogaloo: The Sequel & Knuckles: Scene Two With a Vengence: Chapter Two: Plot Two: Two Year Early Access Edition but I didn't shoot the deputy [♫♪ *Feels so good inside...* ♪♫](https://youtu.be/FnWua_Cniek?t=2m44s)
 Portal 1 is in between Hal-Life 1 & 2, since GLaDOS was turned on while the Black Mesa incident happened Is there as somewhere I can go to get a full read of the whole story? I've played all the games but it's been so long.. I barely remember what half of this stuff is. Borealis? I was following you right up until you started listing off titles. 

It seems unnecessarily complicated.  Actually dug the first game but never got KH2 because I heard you needed to play the GBA game to understand what is going on. Nice to know they continued the trend and I'll never be able to jump back in. Thanks for the explanation, it actually makes sense now. 

If I remember correctly some (if not all) of these are DS titles, so I don't think I'll be catching up by playing. I am actually looking forward to KH3, whenever it's supposed to come out, and I will definitely be picking that up for PS4. 

It is a little crappy that their numbering system and timeline is so confusing because someone new to the series is immediately lost. It wouldn't be a big deal if it didn't have a definitive timeline (like Zelda); however, because you're saying every game is important it sounds like they need to be played in some kind of order. 

 Too real I honestly just want the movie to be ep3 and fuck the outmoded game at this point It's true. She was ahead of her time as an NPC partner. She was cool. For her voice acting, the story, the set pieces, the facial animation, her pert but not overly bedonk donk. 

It was immersive and toight.



Jokes aside its a genuine shame we didn't get to finish her story, not just Freeman's 😕 Miles Prower is also a pun on miles per hour! 0.12

 Well of course *you'd* think that. ... Plebs, for example. Omg I had no idea

EDIT: Family Guy reference *Half-Life 2: Episode Two: Part Two: Act Two: Electric Boogaloo: The Sequel & Knuckles: Scene Two With a Vengence: Chapter Two: Plot Two: Two Year Early Access Edition: The Next Generation* Well, at least *after* HL1. Whether it's before or after HL2 isn't specified, only that it sounds like the Combine occupation is still ongoing when Portal takes place. I googled it and found [this timeline](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Half-Life_universe) (note there are significant plot spoilers for all the games there). That's just because it is Best way to play them is just the order they were released. BBS might be the prequel to the main series but it's best appreciated after you've finished the games that came out before it.

The games do have official numbers, they're just never used in the marketing. There's a reason the upcoming collection is called 2.8. They got it from adding up the numbers of the 2 games and the 1 cinematic that are in the collection. The cinematic basically tells the story of the mobile game, along with a little extra new footage, since you can't really port a smartphone game to console. The mobile game is marked with the Greek letter "chi" which looks like an x. So if you see an x it means "chi" not "ex."

>On how the name of the collection was determined, Nomura stated that Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance is considered "number 2.6" in the series since it follows the events in HD 2.5 Remix, and the χ games, with the absence of Sora, are considered 0, while Birth by Sleep is 0.1, thus resulting in 0.2 for A Fragmentary Passage. When added together, the numbers total 2.8.

So 2.8 is gotten by adding 2.6 + 0.2 + 0. 2.6 is Dream Drop Distance. 0.2 is the brand new game, A Fragmentary Passage. 0 is the cinematic based on the mobile game, x. Kingdom Hearts 2.8 will be coming out on PlayStation 4  so you will be able to play Dream Drop Distance on it even though that game originally came out on the Nintendo 3DS.

As Nomura said, Birth by Sleep is considered 0.1 since it's the prequel game before 1. A Fragmentary Passage is the continuation of the events at the very end of Birth by Sleep, so it's 0.2. You might be a little confused though since A Fragmentary Passage was supposed to be the prologue of KH3 because it takes place right before KH3. That's because the events of A Fragmentary Passage take place over the course of 10 years. They start long before Sora begins his journey and don't end until right before KH3. 

Part of the reason they do these collections is to help consolidate the series. You're right that a lot of the games came out on handheld consoles originally. That's why they release these collections. You can play Chain of Memories and Birth by Sleep on your PlayStation if you play the collection they are in. I don't remember if 358/2 Days is playable or just a cinematic but the cinematic would be enough to understand that game. Ah yes, final fantasy XXL thought it was Hurley from lost Breaking News. Millions of redditors file a class action lawsuit against Square Enix for using their likeness without permission.  Final Fantasy main characters stand out so much from the NPCs. Sometimes it feels like they have different art styles. The details are pretty unreal.  Stretch-marks on his cheeks?  Yikes. Camera on a neck strap?

Final Fantasy fashion is intense. Finally, a realistic-looking male character in a Final Fantasy game.  We are not just eye candy for Japanese schoolgirls to objectify! Pretty sure this is how Japan views American tourist that visit just cause of anime.  Man Libertus really let himself go after Kingsglaive. Holy fucking shit. I'm shaving my face and head and going running tomorrow.  What's the context of this scene? http://i.imgur.com/vsxcoLb.png your own cameo doesn't count as cosplay. GIANT METEOR 2016 

NO LIVES MATTER Does... does he have stretch marks on his face? FF7 shout out on his shirt? 4 8 15 16 23 42 mhm, can smell the body odor from here. Oh wait that's just me. I feel like I need to get this game just to see some of the weird shit that's in it. and I can't deny that I want to camp out with bros after fighting goblins and shit. say what you will about final fantasy but they give you things you never imagine to ask for in games that's commendable in some aspect.  Jorge Garcia? I don't understand this game series. FF1 looks like it's set in a medieval fantasy world with monsters but this one has cars and modern stuff?  You can't lie to me!
http://i.imgur.com/Cf3Wy7m.png 
4 8 15 16 23 42 Funny part is he weighs a lot but I'm sure he doesn't grunt like a damn caveman when putting gas in a damn car.

*glares at Noctis* Do they have lipitor in FF?? Weird to find the fat guy from Lost in a Final Fantasy game... I wanna see Jessica Nigri attempt this. Ah yes, Final Fantasy Diabeetus Okay, but does he have boob jiggle physics? That's just Hurley from Lost I always wondered what happened to Hurley after Lost concluded The guy from Lost? How the fuck does he have stretch marks on his fat face?  **Ah yes, final fantasy XXL** Welcome to next year's most popular cosplay costume across North America! Right beside dozens in Pikachu onesies! So they have an american character. Vyv rules.

I went from nearly broke to ~35,000 Gil just doing 3 quests for him. Jesus Christ. I actually look like him lol. Dildo Schwaggins. I'd wear that shirt.  May I take a photograph of you m'lady? I lost track of FFs after 10

Can someone please help me understand when did FF enter more modern day worlds? Dat 400 lb russian hacker tho
 It's one thing to be fat.... but please, for the love of everyone, CUT YOUR DISGUSTING GREASY HAIR.    Get a normal haircut.   Hurley?  Lol he looks like Hurley from Lost. Hurley? Is the game worth it? Easiest cosplay ever. Just put on your everyday clothes. /s Totally the Japanese's way of throwing shade at Americans ......................................................... what. he finally got off the island?!?! Hurley?  4 8 15 16 23 42 It's Dildo Shwaggins Hurley or Redditor joke, ha! Kind of looks like Hugo from LOST. 4 8 15 16 23 42 Looks great. All the character *models* look great. But my god, the character *designs* of the people you play as are so bad to me that I won't buy the game just due to that. They just look fucking horrible. They look great as far as the graphics go and how real they look, but their design is just fucking *godawful*. Maybe if ONE of them looked like......that....it would be okay. But all of them? Seriously, if there was like a 5 buck DLC re-skin thing they had or something where it would simply change how fucking ridiculous they look, I would gladly pay it so I could get this game. That's how bad the designs are to me. God that looks amazing.  Going to need to pick it up soon Shit, that's about 1/2 of the people who attend DragonCon. That's no ones fantasy.  Less chocobo, more chocolate. I looked for you.  that is faaaaar bigger than just a double XL Wouldn't that be the same as FFXXX.

Things just got interesting. Also known as final fantasy XXX. ;) must be because it features OP's mom. Dont forget Final Fantasy XXX  IV, VIII, XV, XVI, XXIII, XLII WE HAVE TO GO BACK! I think the opening would have been much more emotional if this guy were pushing the car along with them and *Shamabala* by Three Dog Night started playing... Curse of the BLITZ! DUDE! That is the exact same thing I said when I saw him. I was soo disappointed when he opened his mouth. Exactly! When approaching him I was thinking if some huge Lost Easter egg was coming.  It is. They're going golfing to see who wins them deodorant sticks.

They have all equipment needed on that Island to go golfing. Just limited deodorant!
 *heavy breathing* Guarantee we will see someone post a pic who looks just like this dude within 2 days. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D52IKuHOq8M&t=0m50s He looks different without a fedora. Right, here's a thing: How many Redditors actually look like this? I don't think I've ever really seen a neckbeard on Reddit. I mean, they probably don't post pictures of themselves much, but I'm preeeetty sure they're actually a really small minority. As far as I can tell it's just skinny awkward liberal IT guys like me. **BREAKING:** The hacker Four "hundred pound" Chan and white supremacist Pepe the Frog have declared meme warfare against Square Enix. Pft my boobs are much bigger.  You mean sign an online petition? M'Lawsuit *Slams fedora on the ground*

THIS IS AN OUTRAGE! Love seeing redditors talk shit and stereotype about other redditors. How can you have a superiority complex over a group that you're a part of? Wouldn't surprise me if Nomura (basically Square Enix's iconic character designer) only made the central characters, and others did the rest.  It would explain why most people look kinda normal, and some are just classic Final Fantasy.  [spot the protagonist](http://i.imgur.com/7WOfZ9F.jpg) The greatest contrast for me was Cindy and Cid's design. Cindy looks completely ridiculous while, for once, Cid actually doesn't. but that's like Japan dude...

Most people seem super normal and then you run into the super weird fashion people Exactly! the group feel like it traveled from another universe. Even the car, the other cars look nothing like it. I feel like when they scraped FF versus into FFXV they just took the main characters and put them in a game they already were working on for something else. 
 think its because they have a really damn good CGI system that can make things like skin look pretty real but then make their characters super japanese and over the top looking. most games with access to those kinds of graphics try to go for realism Stretch marks? Maybe it L's my phone screen but I see tears of joy after being released from 10yrs of  development Pretty sure it's sweat. That area is pretty hot in the game, with the characters commenting on it Looks like sunscreen streaks to me That's exactly what I thought!

I assumed the sudden on-set of fattening was a result of the game's events, chaos or w/e (still haven't got my copy :( )

...but then I noticed he's a damned tourist!

:/ I love the his lazy right eye as well. Someone somewhere worked hours to design this guy and I bet looking at him makes them proud. needs more belts
 Not FF fashion, that's the way Asians do it. Small electronics like point and shoot cameras, phones, they have it around their neck like an ID card. A lot of exchange students still do it when you spot them walking around campus. It's also because Asian places are a lot more high tech where ID and purchases are all done through the phone. Believe it or not the US is actually ancient when it comes to mobile. Mmmm... *eye candy.* >We are not just eye candy for Japanese schoolgirls to objectify!

[Actually...](https://i.redd.it/zldsan2mcq0x.jpg) That's actually just what Japan thinks Americans look like.

The Noctis Boy Band is what they envision themselves as. When you go to Akihabara, you'll see them.  In the maid cafe's loading up on cookies and ice-cream.

Just don't ask ^why ^^I ^^^was ^^^^there I've never played Final Fantasy, but I live in Japan, and this is a pretty good representation of American tourists tbh.  I thought that was the premise of the game "Jpop boy band visits Midwestern United States and things get wacky because of global warming" He's a fuckin elephant, isn't he?! I mean, it's accurate. That's how everyone views them because it's pretty much always accurate, unless they're the anorexic kind.  Pretty sure Japan's views are pretty spot-on this time around. From my last trip to Aki there's no shortage of natives and tourists that look like this. It's a toss up. To be honest it's been a while since I saw Kingsglaive and having not yet played XV I legitimately thought this WAS Libertus.  10/10 Most underrated comment. Good luck. Lol "tomorrow" If you're really motivated to change then good on you man! Don't give up! It's going to be a difficult process, but if you're truly determined, you WILL see the changes.

Best of luck! I hope to see before and after pics one day on here that shows how awesome you've become! If you keep it up, you can look like Prompto, he started off as big as this npc, and now he's one of the skinny main dudes by running everyday. He wants you to take pictures of landmarks. He's a side quest npc He wants nudes. Google hat kein chill... ROFL I reversed image searched it myself and got "girl"
http://i.imgur.com/TLqlPqJ.png rekt Well.....well......well......he.....he......is a fat ass. Someone else said it's probably sweat since he's in a particular hot area Not really. People seem to forget that pretty much everything in FF games are recurring themes.

For Meteor in particular:

>The recurring ability.

>The plot device and spell from Final Fantasy IV and its sequels.

>The vehicle from Final Fantasy V.

>The plot device from Final Fantasy VII.

>The plot device from Final Fantasy XIV.

>The battle theme of Nael Van Darnus from Final Fantasy XIV.

>The track from Final Fantasy XIV. What's that shirt say? Looks like "live fat breathe meteor". [removed] Technically a reference to the fact the town itself is powered by an "active" Meteor. I think it refers to the meteor in XV. Looks like he's in Lestallum which would make sense.  Dude... In game I say I do, but then I end up staying in a caravan because it's usually close to me...  I've been playing it pretty hardcore since launch and I can say I want nothing more than to go on a road trip with my bros now.  That's what I thought too. 
 The individual games are all totally unrelated.  FF7 has trains, bike and mako reactor.
FF8 has cars and flyings universities.

FF15 is not the first FF to be in a somewhat modern settings, except that's still fantasy, just not a medieval one 
 Yeah, the main FF games each have their own continuity and setting. FF13 also blended fantasy and sci-fi elements, but in addition to that FF15 seems to model itself after the real world more closely then any previous game in the series. The setting changed from European-style castles and medieval towns to open roads and broad landscapes reminiscent of North America, [as one review discusses](http://www.avclub.com/review/final-fantasy-xv-remembers-past-it-belongs-present-246627) Watch Kingsglaive and it'll really help you understand what this series is about. A lot of magic and tech meshing, to make very interesting ideas. Yeah, they mix it up. Each game is it's own self contained story in it's own setting. There are recurring characters and themes, as well as game play elements, but they are not sequels in the traditional sense.  I miss the fantasy setting, or even the fantasy setting with steam-punk thrown in. Now its just futuristic and I hate it because FF usually set the trend for the rest of the rpgs that come out. 1-6, 9, 11, and 14 are traditional High Fantasy.  
7, 8, 12, 13, and now 15 are "Modern" fantasy, with robots and cars and lots of sci-fi stuff.

10 was an odd case 'cause it was set in a world with potential for high tech stuff, but a malevolent god-thing would come around to destroy shit like crazy if technology got too advanced. Yeah, and it's every single time. You can swing around enormous swords and axes but handling the gas is just too much for Noctis. She'd probably need a few more implants to match him. He was an excellent number one. came to see if anyone mentioned Hurley Modern, more grounded settings started happening with 7.

In fact, since 7, FF9 is the only non-MMO final fantasy to be traditional high fantasy-- and that was a PS1 game. FFVI : Steampunk settings with Magitek Armors, Mechanical Sand Castle, Chainsaw and Bowgun.

FFVII : Dystopian Cyberpunk settings mixed with Fantasy element. You have Trains, Robots, Evil Corporate, Machine Gun, Mobile phone etc.

FFVIII : The closest to XV in term of settings aestethic, mixes modern settings (Cars, Trains, Robots, Machine Gun, Gas Station)with Fantasy settings.

FFX : Zanarkand is literally very advanced in term of technology with Mech, High rise building, big sports stadium and Pop Concert.

So to answer your questions, since FFVI All the games are unrelated. The meshing of magic and reality has been a part of the games for ages and this one does it really well  I'm very early in but yes, I am digging it so far. absolutely  Just curious- you feel this way about all final fantasy, all/most jrpgs, or JUST ff15? what ? you not a fan of copious amounts of teen angst ?  
You never saw Sasuke and thought : Yeah, I want this guy to be the next Final Fantasy MC? Personally I don't want my royal prince player character to look remotely like a overweight balding dude.

Also the character designs in this are probably the most toned down I've seen in Final Fantasy games. The main protagonists just look like a bunch of ultra-modern rich kids from the big city... which they are. You're just jealous you can't pull off those rad threads.

Ohh, the glasses guy I bet he is the sensitive one, what a hunk.

Seriously, they are over the top, but I am not gonna let it bother me. Who cares if they look silly. IDK, maybe I have watched too much anime, it really doesn't bother me that much. I got used to it within like 5 minutes of playing. 

That said, you do you, I am not gonna tell you what to play or how to feel, I just disagree that they look "horrible". The style is just different from what you consider normal.  You must not like anime. Are you upset that they look like anime characters?   You can change each of their outfits in the game right away. These are just the default ones they give you. You're not willing to play a 50 hour RPG simply because of how a character looks? That is truly the most ridiculous thing here. Some of the art is like... truly shocking. Sometimes you can tell it's not real because it looks TOO good.  tell that to /r/stuffers google "feeder fetish" Maybe for *you* Not with *that* attitude, it isn't! That's why it's the _final_ fantasy. **II** meta **IV** me. Wouldn't XXL and XXX be the same one? THE ROMAN NUMERALS MASON, WHAT DO THEY MEAN?  4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Winning lotto numbers. Can somebody explain why this comment is so good? The numbers... "Awwwwww mannnnn" /r/justneckbeardthings *FEDORA INTENSIFIES* High blood pressure... *fedora tipping intensifies*

EDIT: fuck it, I don't care if someone below me said it first. I'm keeping it And then we will be flooded with Sexy versions that look nothing like the person but show boob. Isn't this hugo from lost? [You rang?](https://i.imgur.com/HFNwnVi.png)  Thank you for this. Nomura initially designed the whole game but they scrapped all that. It's possible he designed this guy too but I doubt it your probably right Isn't it a core principle of animation to make all aspects conform stylistically? Like for a cartoon, there would be a lead animator, and then a bunch of secondary animators that are trained to follow the lead animator's style. I'd assume the same for AAA games tbh. With japanese games/anime it's almost always the one that looks the most like a freak What the fuck is up with that guy's hair??? This shit looks awful I feel like this should be a subreddit.  I thought 14 Cid looked alright Cindy has the worst case of "sexy hot female character in a JRPG" i have ever seen. Not that I'm complaining, just that the contrast between her and everyone else is kind of absurd. Imagine if you were watching Inception and one of the supporting characters was always wearing sexy lingerie for no apparent reason.

Edit: FYI I am not offended. She's still hot as fuck. I don't know about you but this is how my auto mechanic routinely dresses. The fact that he's a 300-lb male makes it a little strange, though. Is this ff15 cid? [deleted] Psh, has that southern accent and that Dixie Chick thing going on. So good.  Isn't that kind of the point though? I'm not too far into it so if I'm wrong just tell me, but it seems like you are "royalty" driving around with the "working class."

If the Queen of England started driving around my small Iowa town, she would look way out of place as well.  Struggle was real.  and they are fucking wearing black leather lol I swear to god Tetsuya Namora's muse is a leather belt. Not that I'm complaining. Mhmm... candy. Mmm. Beer. As the Onion reported:

#[Asian Teen Has Sweaty Middle-Aged-Man Fetish](http://www.theonion.com/article/asian-teen-has-sweaty-middle-aged-man-fetish-2649)

>AOMORI, JAPAN—At first glance, 17-year-old Misaki Nakajima seems like any other shy and submissive Japanese schoolgirl. She loves shopping, text messaging, and the color pink. But beneath her wholesome exterior lies a wicked secret: Misaki Nakajima is consumed by sexual fantasies involving sweaty, middle-aged American men.
The shy Japanese nymph enjoys fantasizing about fat fortysomethings with excessive neck and back hair.

>"I can't explain it," said Nakajima, dressed in a pleated miniskirt and pure white knee socks. "There's just something about American men who are at least twice my age and nearly three times my body weight that totally drives me wild."

>... why I'm in Japan right now. When my sister came to visit we went to a maid cafe just to say we went. It was awful. You could almost see the despair dripping out of the walls. Would not recommended. On the plus side it's nice to glance around and think "man...I'm the hottest white dude here by far" *Why were you there?* Fat dude here, who just got back from trip to Tokyo. Can confirm.  I just looked up these cafés and... uhhh wow. I just watched Steins;Gate. Don't remind me 😢 I imagine there are some of [these guys](https://youtu.be/_mkiGMtbrPM?t=230) walking around with their waifus.

At 3:50 in case time link doesn't work. Can't miss him. Im going to regret this...ELI5 maid cafe? No fanny pack Especially on running in the desert with leather on.  Naw, this NPC's acting is believable. Couldn't be Libertus.  I saw Kingsglaive *yesterday* and I thought this was Libertus. I could definitely believe he would let himself go after that. shit. ok, TOMORROW I swear And he pays big bucks  ~~Oh god, Nael. Stupid fight nearly broke our raid group...~~

It's fun to see those themes. Like a Where's Waldo. I dunno, the meteor itself is somewhat reminiscent of the FFVII logo meteor. Live. Eat. Breathe. Meteor.  "Live fat. Breathe meteor."

Mantra of an obese stoner? Not really sure, all I saw was "Meteor" and I got super excited thinking it was a FF7 nod. booo  they were all meat eaters Dude > flyings universities

This was the most ridiculous thing I've ever experienced in a Final Fantasy game, a flying school, because flying airships are too mainstream.  9 had flying ships made of wood. Man I want to play these for the first time again FF1 has modernized tech as well in the Sky Fortress. FF4 had tanks and technology in Babel Tower and space flight. This just looks modern by setting standards. It's as much of a staple of the series as the series itself. im sorry but the more realistic look of the ff15 world ends up making the jrpg as fuck main character stick out like sore thumbs  6 Is traditional High Fantasy? I wouldn't call Magitek Mecha-style robot vehicles traditional...  I wouldn't count FF7 exclusively as modern, it's more like a hybrid of settings/themes like FF6 was. It definitely had modern tech in it, but it combined medieval with modern more than anything. I mean, take out Midgard alone and it's extremely close to FF6 in terms of what's in the world. Oh what I wouldn't give for another FF in the  veign of 10. 6 is straight Victorian steampunk. I agree with this. FF7 is the first FF that looks similar to our reality. You have similarly looking buildings while FF6 is more medieval/steampunk-ish. FF7 also had cars and even highways. Hmmm.. Now I need to play that game again. Similar, but still fantasy mixed with sci-fi, pretty far removed from our reality.

I was asking because I haven't followed the games recently and I was wondering if they have been converging on modern real-life-like worlds. FF9 isn't really traditionally high-fantasy. It was steampunk with muppets.

There were castles, sure, but they were Steampunk castles like Edgar Figaro's castle in FF6. Lindbulm was like a "good guy" version of Empire Geshtahl.

Castle Alexandria seemed to purposely keep itself low-technology, but the Queen's Airforce was steam-powered airships, later had Magitech when she made the deal with the "devil" (Kuja). X is more traditional in it's fantasy setting (more so than 7 and 8) though. Each character has a traditional role (warrior, black mage, summoner, thief, sniper, etc) and because of Sin and the religion of Yu Yevon, the world is technologically stunted...it doesn't feel weird that the characters use weapons like swords and stuff over guns like in the other games like 7, 8, and 15 where there is more of technological boom.  It has. I've played them up to X-2 (never finished that one, got kinda annoyed at the end)

It's just that I find the more modern "reality" really interesting. Think back to 7, it was an older image of the future mixed with some of the past, 8 was pretty much a fantasy past with a little space tossed in, but I don't recall any of them looking as modern as the picture here. To be fair though, if you're playing on the PS4, his hair looks amazingly soft. As a former teenager, I am offended by this statement.

^^^^^^/s Yeah I'm not sure how these guys look ridiculous compared to old Final Fantasy games. Their hair is stylized but their clothes are pretty damn normal. Tank tops. Shirt and jeans. Not too out there.  well if they looked ugly and inbred it would be more realistic for a prince  None of the characters in any Final Fantasy look "normal" though. If anything these look closer to "normal" or what we could see today in real life than anything they've had recently in their other games. That might be the problem with it.  Depends on the anime.  It's something that matters to me, yes. If I'm playing 50+ hour game and hate how the characters look every single one of those hours, yeah that's gonna be a deciding factor into whether or not I'll be buying it, regardless of whatever else is good or bad about the game. Not sure how that's ridiculous.  Yeah, FFXV is stunningly pretty. I can hardly believe how damn good that game looks. r/ofcoursethatsathing Wow.... Some go from perfect to very unhealthy. What a weird fetish. For some reason it seems like it is all women there. I know there's a kink for everything I guess I'm just surprised that there are no men posting photos. Whyyyyyy That's nothing compared to r/immobile Big Guy? Final Fatnasty.  It's what you fantasize about after you've run out of other fantasies FIND JACK! I thought those were Hurley's shirt sizes. There is a character in the show "Lost" named Hurley who wins the lottery with the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Those numbers are important during pretty much the entirety of the series so it's a reference that everyone gets. GrandTh3ftCompliment thought it was clever (although I don't know why it deserves gold but who knows, people are retarded) to replace the numbers by roman numerals because this is a final fantasy related thread and final fantasy use roman numerals to number their game. Now you can laugh at this epic joke. Wh4t num8ers?  15 there someth1ng 6othering you?  I don't see the big deal.  2 3ach their own I guess...  42 Remember Mason! Vorkuta! That is who I picture as the ultimate neckbeard. He also reminds me of the guy from lost disappointed that it actually exists  So much hate and negativity. I couldn't read it anymore. So depressing from the guys who claim not to be. Ahh ,  my least favorite but the most common cosplay - the unnecessary boob My first thought Commas man, they're your friend. Jesus they might as well have just gone with it and made the changes into the next game. I love how in animeland you can apparently walk around with a gigantic weapon and nobody bats an eyelash. http://snafu-comics.com/swmcomic/yugioh/ I know, right? Who even does a chili bowl? As someone who hasn't really played ff, are all the games connected? >Imagine if you were watching Inception and one of the supporting characters was always wearing sexy lingerie

Michael Caine yes please > Not that I'm complaining

/r/playitfortheplot I'm 35 hours into the game and still, every time I see Cidney I always exclaim "Jesus Christ" and stare at her boobs. It really doesn't help that the intro to her theme song almost sounds like a porno riff. [Nothing to say about the main characters tho ?](http://images.eurogamer.net/2013/articles/1/7/8/9/6/0/9/square-enix-explains-why-final-fantasy-15s-main-characters-all-wear-black-1445607026072.jpg/EG11/thumbnail/1200x630/format/jpg/1789609.jpg) The funny thing is, in many games there are lots of "sexy hot male character" tropes. Comic books too. People have been complaining for years about oversexualized female body types and stuff. Meanwhile the men are all beefcakes wearing skin-tight ball-hugging materials.

"Oh no a female character in Final Fantasy XV is wearing sexy clothes and showing cleavage" -- says the people playing a party of 4 guys, one of whom is ripped and wears no shirt the entire game. Seriously! Mechanics don't wear protective clothing because of style, they do it to prevent themselves from being cut by sharp metal edges or burned by hot oil. 

It would have been far more interesting if you had met her as a bit of a tomboy, dirty and fully clothed and thought nothing of it, only to see her later off-duty and being surprised by how she looks cleaned up.  Bruv. Have you even been to Lestallum?

Let me just say a few words:

Prostitutes. Everywhere. All in bikinis and a jumper. It's ... It's so amazing. Daughter There's still a Cid in FFXV, so in Japan it's Cid and Cidney.

Similar to in FFV, when Cid had a grandson, Mid.

I'm not sure why they changed Cidney to Cindy in the US/EU. Cidney (Sidney) is a common enough English female name. They comment on that too. They were bitching about it in the game and said, "Well you are wearing a jacket." I took their jackets off and they're still complaining! Mmm.... eyes  http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/c/2/gfs_50140_2_3.jpg Sigh... A few years ago I thought girls would like me in just a few more years. Now it seems I have to wait for another 15. OK but see if you've ever read any NTR doujinshi.... kek I wonder if the person who wrote that knows that that's an actual fetish in Japan, look up bara yaoi or better yet don't why not? For karma. She's a bit of a karmawhore My wife and her sister can be total weebos sometimes... So the only thing worse is when your wife wants to go.  Then she thinks it's cute, so we have to go again with her sister.

I don't know which is more depressing the guys in trenchcoats that finally made the pilgrimage, the girls working there, or every time I got the bill and it was 10,000 Yen more than I wanted to spend on a coke. lol the one eye'd king! He was one of the maids. Some things are better left unknown... Yeah, wow.  Closer to the world of warcraft then the what the fuck am I doing with my life.  But it's certainly got both aspects mixed in there, along with sweat and tears. Not as much as I regret being there. twice.  It's a bunch of post high school girls who immediately regret not studying hard enough for university that dress up in classical french maid outfits (not the sexy ones you may have in mind) and wear cat ears, and sing really bad AKB47 muzak and mew mew for you to buy coke floats for 1500 Yen.  It's like one of those 1950's themed cafe's that charges too much for something I'm just not nostalgic about as I don't have any connection to it. I wanted to like him so badly.
I wanted to believe... He was like Seth Rogen with less vocal range... Which Seth doesn't have a lot to begin with. I'll never forget when he learns of that one person's  death and wants to yell but it comes out as a question.

"She's dead Libertus."

"My ASS!?!" I don't think I understand Final Fantasy. I haven't played since VII and it seems a little different... I like big bucks and I cannot lie Be alive, enjoy Bios' pleasures.

now take a fat ogre shit and let it drop harder than the one from 65kk years  ago Saying it out loud it sounds like meatier It's a reference to an in game meteor that he treats as a tourist attraction It's a pun. The term "flying university" is a real thing. It's uncommon these days but a century and a half ago it was an underground group of intellectuals who lectured and taught people who wouldn't otherwise be allowed to learn (like women and minorities) in an actual university. They call it flying because it was illegal so it would move all around the country to avoid the authorities catching on.


But is it LITERALLY a flying school or are you making a joke? I'm not a fan of JRPGs and anime stuff so I've never played FF in my life. @Rwby Don't forget the airships of 4. Final Fantasy X-2 exists Not really. XIII was weird magic sci-fi as well, and XIV is fairly close to probably either 6 or 9, would be the closest I could place it. XV is the only one that's more grounded in reality. Amazingly soft and aliased to hell and back if it's in front of anything but more hair. teen angst is fun to think about when you're not a teen. if it's not then you must still live a drama filled lifestyle Meanwhile you have someone like Tidus with his asymmetrical outfit, Lulu with her skirt made of belts, and let's not forget Cait Sith a goddamn magical cat riding on the back of a giant stuffed animal.  >Final ***Fantasy*** r/whyisthatathing r/subteddithashtags I mean meh, it's one of the tamer ones. After a while nothing surprises you. You become numb. I haven't felt phased by a quirky fetish since the dick-neck one. 

For me eventually it stops being weird and starts becoming fascinating. I just feel so compelled to figure out why these attractions come about in certain people. Everyone usually just says "lol weird" and moves on but I want answers. Why do these fantasies emerge inside people's brains? What evolutionary purpose do these serve? And why the hell do you people keep linking those subreddits? Well it's like gonewild, some men do post but they tend to get downvoted because the fan base are heterosexual men.  I assume the core base of stuffers is also heterosexual men.

I think that's how it's meant to be. Idk English is stupid. Dude, he's been in a comma for 3 years; be more sensitive why don't ya. In Japan: 

*"Oh, they must be cosplayers!"* No. At least story-wise they aren't.

There are items, monsters, weapons and other things with the same names, likenesses throughout the franchise though. Cid is a recurring character in name only for the most part. The Cid character is also usually some kind of mechanic. No, but some names and archetypes are reused across games. Nearly every final fantasy game has a guy named Cid, and many of the summons are named the same across games.  No, just Cid and chocobos are the main things that are in all of them. Not too much connection outside of that.  No. They just share similarities.  Like the enemies are the same (always cactaur, tonberry, etc.) and there's always a character named Cid. Nope, not at all. Just have characters named Sid or Cid that have to do with airships or machinery. Chocobos and Moogles pop up in every world too. Only the ones that are direct sequels/prequels like FF VII: Crisis Core, FF X-2 or XIII-2. Otherwise, most are independent stories based in different time periods/worlds/universes.  generally no, but there are recurring elements that connect them, and there are a few games that take place in a single universe.

Generally, all games share the same monsters, Guardians, and rules.  Those monsters and guardians may vary in appearance, they are still the same at their core.  A Flan is recognizable as a Flan, Shiva is always a woman made of ice, spells and items share names across games, etc.

There is always a Biggs and a Wedge, and there is always a Cid, but none of these characters are ever the same.

The universe that some of the games share is called Ivalice.  Final Fantasy 12 and all of the Tactics games take place on Ivalice, but at such different times in Ivalice' history that they generally don't share storylines.   The biggest constant in Final Fantasy games that take place on Ivalice is the presence of "Judges".  Judges are basically mounted knights that enforce the law and preside over fights to enforce arbitrary rules for the sake of gaminess.   "No using this school of magic", "no using this particular item", "no healing", etc.


I recommend the Tactics series, btw.  There's not a single bad one and the mechanics are way different from what you might expect from the rest of the series.  It's a shame there are so few because they really are the best. Normally they are not connected at all. Totally different universes.  Not at all. Each main line FF game is a completely unique and seperate world. However they all re-use a fair number of the same names for side characters / summons / places / weapons. Nope. But they do appear in a crossover game of sorts (FF Dissidia) sorry if the spelling is off. 


Where all the franchise's good guys team up to fight all the franchise's bad guys. 


Cid just happens to be a reoccurring character in the sense that there will always be a character in each FF names Cid. They are not the same people.  They reuse names and designs a lot, so they all share a sort of mythos. None of the stories have ever linked themselves with another. So while different from other franchise games, it's not a complete unicorn. Aside from character and monster references, no, with obvious exceptions of X-2 and XIII-2 being direct sequels, as well as some universes being the same- I think it's Tactics and XII that both use Ivalice as their world. You stare at the one disappointing thing about her.

No jiggle physics. Even _Lightning_ had jiggle physics. Yup I said the exact same thing when she turned around to face you. They look like a boy band from the mid 1990s.  needs more jpeg WAKE ME UP > Seriously! Mechanics don't wear protective clothing because of style, they do it to prevent themselves from being cut by sharp metal edges or burned by hot oil. 

My guess is, that's the only reason she has a jacket at all.

I'd have gone with unzipped coveralls + bikini if I was the character designer... But coveralls get warm in a place like Leide, so honestly I can see where she's coming from.

Also, this is a game world where machine guns exist, but the PCs all use melee weapons and pistols. And Cindy's a good enough mechanic to revert a custom luxury sedan from "crumpled dollar bill" status to brand new in minutes, so maybe she's just too skilled to get cut, like a Lethani master. *grand*daughter Shit. This is my favorite comment that makes me want to pick up the game... I took all of their jackets off and they stopped complaining, but then nighttime came and they started sneezing and shivering. Now I've got to put their jackets back on. Curse you immersion!

The especially weird part is that Gladio is actually wearing less when he has his jacket on, as he inexplicably removes his vest to show off the ol' washboard abs. it's the pants. their balls are gonna be on fire. *grant us eyes, grant us eyes. Plant eyes on our brains to cleanse our beastly idiocy.

Doesn't seem to imply any of that. It's not even related except that it's about men and sex.  But it's funny >and it was 10,000 Yen more than I wanted to spend on a coke.

You weren't at a maid cafe...actual maid cafes are no different in price to a normal cafe, about 1000 yen for a cake + drink.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Just a bit.

I'm really liking XV for the most part though. And that's coming from a person who's favorite FF is VII and X as a close second. I have no idea either this is literally my first Final Fantasy game but I fucking love it Up until this one it was pretty much more of the same aesthetic, just applied to different types of fantasy settings. This time they cycled around to urban (rural?) fantasy/magical realism based on familiar stuff like American road trip theming. 

I like it. It's kind of like Stephen King's Dark Tower in how it blends fantasy with modern without making a big deal out of it. Google Balamb Garden. Yeah, it flies; it's your first airship. You get a spaceship shortly thereafter. The Balamb Garden theme is actually one of my favorite pieces of music from VIII, and VIII has the best soundtrack after XIII imo. They're not really universities. They are militarised training facilities for mercenaries. But yes, they literally fly. It's not so ridiculous in the game. They're airships. Hovering is a more accurate term. [Here, a cut scene of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFOgm-_FSuk) It is literal Cait Sith was like an animatronic not actually a magical cat.  > And why the hell do you people keep linking those subreddits?

That one's the easiest to answer! You get to see people's shocked reactions, **and** get karma! I checked the sidebar instead of checking out a bunch of posts. Men have their own apparently... 

r/stuffersmale    All you had to do was follow the damn train! Not Penny's boat :'( No, no, no. How about a tree fidy Hold on my PTSD is kicking in from when I was 12.... This isn't even his final form. You're getting downvoted for saying it's funny. The other guy is getting downvoted for saying it isn't funny. 

I don't know how I'm supposed to side with the hivemind on this one. 

Edit: that changed quickly. Looks like we're for it boys!  alot of the posts there are stupid. they post obvious troll posts from twitter or whatever, and they are so clueless that they think its serious. 90% of the posts are like that. Good god Reddit gets weird at times. #LET THE TENDIES HIT THE FLOOOOOOOR I ... I don't think I'm the same. How long was I in there? They, uh, really like their tendies. This is god damn amazing. We must go deeper

/r/neckbeardnests Or a failed mega man boss. Your face is stupid I've been in a colon  Or Robin Williams (FFVIII) My pet bird is named after Cid Highwind. He's kind of a dick but secretly a sweetheart, same as his namesake.  So kind of like Legend of Zelda? Or a gal named Cid Don't forget Biggs and Wedge.   Even then, it's not the same Cid each time. Although the character is usually some kind of engineer. More like there is a charactet named Cid in all games. They are not the same. In 8 Cid was Robin Williams and in 9 he was a cricket. Also crystals in some shape or another. Gilgamesh was in several of the games too. Moooooooooooogles. So I can jump in with this new one? Well, for the most part. A few of the FF universes have been reused for a multiple games, but each game in the main sequence (i.e. a numbered game) has a unique setting. For example, the world of Ivalice was initially used for Final Fantasy Tactics in 1997, but was later used as the setting for Final Fantasy XII. Didn't one of the designers for FFX imply that it could be a distant-future story set in the same universe as FF7? Or like a jpop boy band from the mid 2010s. Honestly one of my favorite things about the game. They're anime N-Sync Japan didn't let go of that ideal. South Korea too for that matter. *sex slave* You won't regret it. I've played for 26 hours and I'm still in the first region. I've only done 3 main quests. There's... So much... Content... Stop running around goddammit! A hunter is a hunter even in a dream.. Now I'm waking up, I'll forget everything! MAJESTIC It wasn't till the last words that I realized it was bloodborne related so for the first part I just started singing it in my head Worth it. They melt in your mouth! Yeah.  Did they order just a coke? were we there for 20 minutes? sigh. no no no no. I've heard great things about it, but as the previous comment states, it is very different. After finding another person with the same taste in FF games that enjoys it I think I'll give it a shot. Oh so there hasn't been a gradual change? That makes more sense. I was really confused how it could go from what I remember to this. And it's controlled by a joystick twice the size of a man. Pinnacle of engineering Oh yeah. He was actually a SHINRA employee or something, right? Its been so long.  If I remember correctly according to canon he is a semi-sentient stuffed toy that was bought to life with an odd magic power that only Reeve has and despite being remote controlled has a personality distinct from Reeve.

You're full of shit Or a banana suit (FFVI) No, the worlds are different completely.  Hardly any same names for cities and most other characters.   Pretty much (recurring character names/item names/monsters etc) except not every game follows the same plot beats like Zelda, nor are they set in the same world each time.  Isn't she technically not Cid though? Since there's a mechanic character actually named Cid? HOW CAN YOU FORGET THE [CACTUARS](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qhvyW5NLZHA/maxresdefault.jpg)? > Biggs and Wedge

like from Star Wars? Absolutely! Each title is designed for new players to be able to jump into it easily. Other way around. If you play X-2, there's an Al-Bhed character named Shinra who says he's theorized a way to use the energy from the farplane. People theorize that this is the founder of Shinra Corp, since mako energy seems to be equivalent to farplane energy. Basically, X comes a looooooooooong time before VII. >mid 2010  

So... now? N-Sync for Edgelords. South Korean bands also dress quite hip-hop, urban  *motorcade* A hunter is a hunter even in a fantasy... My favorite is X and VII is a close second and I love XV. Seriously; this isn't even a matter of trying XV, it's a matter of playing XV. 

I do recomend to watch the anime episodes (6 episodes from 4-17 min long) and the Kingsglave movie before playing the game tho. Not unless 11 or 14 (the MMOs) had this sort of stuff. I didn't play those. 

But even VII had commuter trains and casinos. I've just never seen it be quite this real-world but it doesn't really feel out of line to me. 

The bigger surprise to me was the gameplay. I don't track prerelease hype and didn't realize it was an open-world action brawler.  Well, it was was designed by a giant psychopathic yellow blob dude who spends all his time in the basement. Yep you got it. There's even a scene where they let Cait Sith die in order to get something and then a few minutes later a replica Cait Sith shows up  Cait Sith was actually Reeve, one of the Turks thrown in prison for treason. Separate, but equal. Making America Great Again! See you in another FF brotha' I CAN'T GET THESE FUCKING NUMBERS OUT OF MY HEAD. [deleted] all i know is my gut says, maybe > FTFY m'senpai

#BELONGS IN THA TRASH

#HAWHAWHAWHAW The game is growing like never before. We're a few days short of the new free DLC, which brings 2 new operators and a new map (17th Nov.). A few weeks after that we'll get the next content patch with another new map. I play on PC and the community is definitely large enough and growing.  The subreddit makes it sound like the pc base is pretty bumping.We have higher than normal player numbers right now Just played it all weekend, and wait time for every game was less than a minute. The devs have done a great job at keeping it updated and interesting This game will have a large community for a while. It's one of the few newer games out that is very competitive and focuses on team work.   I never wait more than 15 seconds to find a game on weekends, also on PC This past week they recorded higher players on steam than ever before, more people play now than at launch I'm told, so yeah  I played during the free weekend and the only reason why I'm on reddit is because it just ended. But yeah I'd say every lobby was very active,  probably DUE to the free weekend but I saw a lot of players with fully customized classes and weapons so I assume they aren't new. Whenever I get money to buy this game I certainly will r/rainbow6 welcomes you. Get back into it soon man, Season 4 is about to drop.  Doesn't take too long to find a match, subreddit is pretty alive still. Compared to most games, community is hardly toxic. Devs are coming out with a whole lot of content this next DLC (this Thursday? I think) and of course the game is still fun.



If your on the fence of buying it, year 2 was confirmed today. Another whole year of free dlc.  Just got back into it after a month off. Definitely still active. Lots of new players and one of the sale weekends a while back brought over a lot of "fucked your mother" shitheads, but aside from that it's still decent Sorry, which game is this? It definitely still has a playerbase but I hear PS4 is where it's at these days  Huge uptick in the player base this weekend with the free weekend and sale on steam Large with so many hackers that they openly brag on the subreddit.

The game is only growing even though it's been out for just over a year. Free DLC has kept the game alive with a loyal fan base. Everyone on there is really nice too. Well, mostly everyone.  R6 Siege Rainbow 6 Siege. Destructible environment filled situations of 5v5 warfare with strategic elements involving attackers playing against defenders. Pretty cool game that sounds like it's going to have a second season of free dlc for the game Free weekend on PC and 25$ on sale.

Just Cause 6 There was a video of someone smashing down a window barricade to flank an opponent, and finds a breaching charge attached on the other side of the barricade.

The half-smashed window barricade and the player got blown away. Based on the way the game is going, it'll probably be an buyable skin before long, don't worry.  Fucking awful.

Whats this got to do with drawing a face in a game? Noooooo "Simmons, I want you to poison Grif's next meal..." Them dirty blues Would be more like "What in Sam's hell is that?" *DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE VIRGIN MARY* Read it in the voice of the soldier on toy story, probably very similar You reddit?

I came here looking for this What game is this? Steam stats say over 10k players a day, and that doesn't take into account the people not playing through Steam. I just started playing and looking for fun people to play with. Anyone in this thread hit me up! I tried to get into it because it looks so awesome but the fact that everyone already k ows the maps and the best way to fuck you up made me quit, i didn't had the strenght to be a target practice for 20 hours straight while being a pain in my team mate's arses. Personally it's one of my favorite games. I just can't play it with Friends because fucking uplay  I actually started playing a couple weeks ago. I find this could easily be one of my go to games. Its fun to play and its always challenging. I'm so glad that there is actually a community that plays rather than dying out after a couple months. What kept it growing is the amazing support Ubisoft is giving on this game - the developers are really active on the subreddit - they are really changing their ways with this game! Recommended buy for anyone that plays CS:GO and is in-need of a better game. There's a free weekend going on, little bitch! ITS HUGE how is the anti-cheat now? Well, because of the free weekend.  I wish they the new players access to some free operators just for the weekend, especially for defense. Overall didn't mind playing with some noobies. Oh, I've been using r/RainbowSixSiege all of this time Rainbow Six: Siege If the servers weren't constantly down on PS4 it'd be great When's the last time you honestly played it because I see very few hackers {-}7 What does this mean?  ALL HAIL LORD CHANKA My guess is that it had to do with how much damage the wall could take before being destroyed. Get out. > Everyone on there is really nice too.

[Not sure if serious](http://i.imgur.com/kaZlhW3.png) Honestly this is the thing driving me nuts about Titanfall 2. In Titanfall 1 all the CoD players with their ggez left about a week in. Then it was great. Titanfall 2 has way too many shitty people on it. So serious question, is it worth buying? I've been looking for a new Xbox One game for awhile but haven't committed because I don't want to waste the money. Just really looking for a good multiplayer that won't get boring after two months. How's the situation on hackers? Last time I considered buying it, I read there's no AC in place meaning it's a total shit fest. By Free DLC do you mean the new characters that cost a shit load of in game currency to buy? Wish i redeemed that instead of assassin's creed sigh. Less than a year, it'll be a year on December 1st. {-}7 Would I like it if I like CS:GO? Aww, no link to the video? Rip. The "{-}" stands for our Lord, Tachanka. The 7 is his arm, saluting us.

{-}7 ALL HAIL LORD CHANKA **{-}7** Honestly Idk how that typo happened but screw it Ayy! Cake bros! Happy cakeday to you too lol I know. I wouldn't have noticed mine if I hadn't visited my profile page on mine. They should really just send an automated message or something. what I've actually never seen this game, nor have many other in the thread. R6 filled a void in my gaming life that I've trying to fill for years. It's without a doubt my favorite FPS since COD 4.  Except for me, the game is too much wait and not enough playing, guns can kill in 1 to 2 hits as well which is annoying since it's just whoever shoots first. Ah I was referencing a stupid buzzfeed video that got picked on, check this playlist out :) 

https://youtu.be/ujQDpISEOz4

Basically some feminist on buzzfeed said that video games appealed to the male fantasy and people started remixing it with retarded game moments it's hilarious  Or just go through the teleporter. Nobody knows how that thing works. "I just wish that Grif was dead." "Oh I'd do it, too." ...why did people downvote this? When I say go Ba bum badalada dum da. Da da da ba ba dum da lala lala. HEY Oh god what did i start here. i always thought that... thing's name was "the cheat" ?

Darude: Sandstorm 

I'm shocked you didn't know that.  Yeah, I think there are more players on UPlay than on Steam, but sadly we have no stats for that.  Play terrorist hunt for a while to learn maps. Then do multiplayer. Why can't you play with your friends? UPlay and Steam can play together, all Steam does is launch the game (and UPlay). My kdr has never been soo good. =) YUGE* it works really well, haven't seen any hackers since.  Used to be shit some 6 months ago(?), but now they're running FairFight and BattlEye. So i'd say it's pretty good. After the Free Weekend before the Launch od S3, R6S registered more players than at launch day. These FWs always grow the community exponentially. Even before the free weekend, actually. I did pretty good for a noobie, I held my weight nicely when I learned how to actually play. I got to level 10 in the 4 and a half hours I got the chance to play it and I unlocked a few defense operators as well. Personally I like playing as Castle because I really like fortifying everything Thanks! I have to try connecting a few times to get in, but after that its great. Hosts leaving games on the other hand... Yeah that was a good reason to downvote me  {-}7 All hail Lord Chanka!

(He's a broken and mostly useless operator you can play as who has a deployable turret.) Nope, the guy who broke the wall down is the Operator Sledge. He has a sledgehammer (hence his name) that allows him to destroy any breakable barrier in one go. 

He still would have broken the wall without the nose. Seriously... most people are nice, at least on PC. Maybe because it's a communication based game. No really. It relies heavily on good communication due to cameras and other surveillanve tec. This means you need at least some people skills to play.  :-( You sort of have to. No one wants a shitty teammate who talks shit while losing it for the team every round. These people typically get kicked out by the team. Everyone is nice but not so much like "hey you are awesome" more so like "hey watch your right flank and I will get your left side." It's all about communicating and working together. You don't have to work together but it's the easiest way to win. 

Also things like team killing can happen. So people call out when they toss explosives or spray through walls.  I shot a teammate because he jumped through a window without warning and was met with shouts of "OH MY GOD FUCKING KIDS ON THIS GAME". Try GTA: online. 

Jezz, the fan base is cancer :( I haven't noticed any try hards, just edgy usernames in my experience. Loving tf2 It will get better. Find a Network of people you either know or know are mature adults and just join up with them.  I've only been playing ttf2 for a few days now. We were playing the last titan standing mode. First round this guy was bitching us out in chat that we needed to stick together. Next round we were more grouped but them he was bitching that we were crowding him too much and that's why he died. Some people are just assholes. 

I'm not great at the game but finally getting your titan and running around piloting is just too much fun and it feels so cool.  Die hard FPS player here. This is the best one I've ever owned. I bought it on a whim last November and literally haven't played another game since. Buy it.  Yes. 600 hours+ and still have a ton of fun. Seige is one of the best multiplayer FPS games going On the plus side:
it's my favorite fps I've ever played, the gameplay you won't find anywhere else but siege, and the developer listens to and communicates with its community actively. 

On the negative: 
It's been plagued by netcode and hit reg issues since launch, and the developer is struggling to fix it. They have perpetually said they have been working on it since the game came out. To their credit, they've released patches that have improved it, but in a game where a single headshot from any gun can kill, having good netcode is critical. 

HOWEVER: the actual GAME is easily one of the very best I've ever played. Original gameplay, and unique ways to approach a situation. You need good teamwork and good communication to pull off a win.

Conclusion: Regardless of its issues, it is a stellar game. There's a good reason that the community is bigger than it was at launch a year later. 

(Hail Chanka!) I haven't played it for a long time, but I thought it was one of the best FPS games I'd played in ages.  There are 0 on console and from what I hear,  Battle Eye removed 99.9% of hackers on pc. The community is getting huge. I saw that (even before the free weekend) that there were more players on R6:Siege than Infinite Warfare according  to steam. Basically non-existent on console. I'm not too sure about the situation on PC though. Ubisoft has been hard at work to make sure everything is fair.  They added a new anticheat system a couple months back and the game is finally playable again. I have seen cheaters in the last months but they are few and far between.  I've been playing this non stop for around 2 months now on PC. Haven't encountered a single hacker. Close to nonexistent with the addition on battleye. You might get someone using private hacks but that's pretty rare  By a shit load of currency, do you mean the easily acquired currency that's a better option than making your pay $5 for?  You're correct. I remember playing in October or November, but i guess that was just the open/closed betas It's similar but different. Game flow is a little more smooth (imo), but it lacks the depth of CSGO's considering there's no real economy to speak of. 

That said the guns feel great, and the operators are reasonably well balanced.

If you like the holding angles/taking/retaking aspects of CSGO then you'd probably like it. It's very different from CS GO. A lot slower pace and more tactics involced. But it's a very good game once you get used to the gun mechanics and operator strats.

Edit: The sound system they use in this game is very different from your typical shooter. I hate it, it gets me killed more time then it should. My biggest gripe with the game. Some people like the sound system they use.  You'll love it It was one of the rainbow six videos on Node's channel, that's all I remember. wait question, is your name a play on mike pence? i am wondering since your name is mike pants, which sounds like pence And I've been on mobile all day, which doesn't even show the cake. :( QUOTE I'LL FROWN DOWN COMMA AND WAIT FOR THE END END QUOTE It's definitely a game that requires a lot of patience That's why you always shoot first Something something covered in black stuff Well it's fine, unless you teleport bread.

FTFY This is so bad and retarded that I upvoted.  Ok seriously why are you multiplaying 6 times minus 2?

Wouldn't it already be Rainbow Six if you just had the rainbow and the 6 balls? We can only get into a lobby together through uplay. Uplay sucks at letting us connect. We've had about a week of joining to "session does not exist" then the person goes offline, unfriend...re friend and then nothing changes. Love it.  And really, that's all that matters in the end. Why did people upvote that comment of mine? lol  wow, good news. {-}7 >useless

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Gotcha. It was just my best guess. Thank you for the information! Emphasis on most.

First few hours of free weekend were nice, then I ran into a bad bunch.

These people were clearly experienced veterans that constantly made a beeline at us whether we were defending, or attacking. One of them actually ran around outside where the game will warn you that the enemy is detecting you, and show the enemy team where you are at. Thing is, he didn't give a damn. We all made our way to him and he killed all five of us with clean headshots.

After dominating us for five matches, eventually they admitted to us that they were exploiting us(you gain a significantly higher renown boost for a total 3-0 victory) and left us feeling bitter and angry. One of them had the audacity to spam "BUY THE GAME!" before they left. Like hell am I going to buy the damn game after this happened in **casual** matchmaking. Is there no matchmaking algorithm or anything? Why the hell would the game think setting up back to back rematches is a great idea, when the two teams are no where near each other in skill level? [deleted] Depends on the game. Like I play overwatch on PC and sometimes I get great teammates but also I get a lot of assholes or people who just like to yell and spout memes. I notice it happens more when I fall into the lower ranks because I am on a losing streaks, so maybe it's just that.

But yeah I notice some games have better communities than others Played it on PC. Played mostly single player missions to get practice, finally went online and played a match where I sucked, and the entire team was so mean to me that I quit and refunded the game... And I had bought the golden edition thing. Then again, I have anxiety and am easily discouraged.  >People skills

>Reddit

Pick one Yeah and when you get random assholes on your team who kill you or flood the coms with shit you lose. The game is fantastic but lets not pretend that the community is perfect. Sometimes I like to turn on voice chat in GTA:O to hear all the ridiculous shit that gets said and sometimes it's genuinely fucking hilarious. And then I hear an adult russian man screaming at an 11 year old boy and like 7 different people constantly calling each other noobs and I remember why I turn voice chat off and don't turn it back on.

GTA:O seriously has the worst community I have ever seen, and that's coming from someone who played League and actively plays Dota. It just seems to attract the biggest assholes for some reason. And they're not even intelligent assholes who actually roast you or eloquently explain why you're shit, they literally just spout noob repeatedly over voice chat. How do you say a word so often without it instantly losing any meaning to you? Seriously I only play GTA with like 3 of my friends and I'm just miserable if I play alone. 

Unless there are like Level 20 people I can kill easily lol >tf2

Wrong game. I too love Team Fortress 2 That's great to hear! The last FPS that I played non stop was either Black Ops 1/2, or Halo Reach so that's really refreshing to hear. Thank you! I recently bought this game but I just can't seem to get into it. I love FPS like csgo and battlefield so this game seemed perfect for me. Perhaps it's how short the matches can be or I've thought perhaps the gunplay is more akin to battlefield, but it feels like csgo. I don't know I really want to love this game, is there a particular mindset I need or any advice for getting into it? Awesome! I'll be looking into it in the coming weeks, thank you!
 Just wanted to say I picked it up tonight. Thank you for the recommendation! I can't wait to see how it is. That isn't exactly high praise.  > Infinite Warfare

I mean, we'd be praising them even more if they managed to get a negative playercount. PC Gamer by heart :(

Thanks for the info though. Arent they worth 25000 or something ridiculous? I've never hae more than 3k I wouldn't call it more tactical than CSGO imo. Wow,I really like the system type used, its one of the best things in the game for me. But you need to use a good headphone. I can understand from where the sound is coming perfectly.. Well, I personally don't like sitting around waiting but I can imagine other people like the immersion. Is that it? You're scared of a little black stuff? "I've done nothing but teleport bread for three days." "Wait, Simmons? How do you know that song?" GO! Throw it at him, not me! Jooiooiioiorbb Now that you mention it, yes, the Coatch uses some... peculiar pronunciations. ethantwerking.jpg Who's that Seems like a trend to call anyone who doesn't like something a keemstar fan, no matter fucking what. So what? You can't handle the fact Alex is a stupid &#42;i&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;? :)

How neat is that! #**Happy fourth cake day!**
Today is your fourth “cake day,” meaning that you have “been” a Redditor for four years.

Congratulations, my friend! You win… nothing! But do have a good day. I think you can find that one on Google Playstore Genius  {-}7 Some of the top players (platinum/diamond rank) have long since set up "smurf" accounts to play on instead of their main login. This is to both save their high rank from potential losses (ensuring they get a special reward for finishing the season as a top rank) and to have fun with low level newbies instead of playing other pros all the time.

Although I'm sure it's just to be show off fuckers sometimes too.

EDIT: Should add that the matchmaking is indeed a pile of shit sometimes and you get entirely unbalanced teams. 

Despite the above issues, I haven't been as obsessive about a game as I am about this one since Sonic 3 on the megadrive. Highly recommend. If you want to get good here's a few tips... Don't run, wait. Play as a team and use your mics. Aim your fucking gun. Like use your gun!!! I watch so many players running around and never fucking using their sights, then they try and throw a nitro cell or some shit. Play smart and get your gun up and wait and noobs will run right into your sights.  I'm certain rematches are voted on, you can always just back when you get rekt'd.  There is ranked where it's actually pretty even but in causal I don't think there is.  > These people were clearly experienced veterans that constantly made a beeline at us whether we were defending, or attacking. One of them actually ran around outside where the game will warn you that the enemy is detecting you, and show the enemy team where you are at. Thing is, he didn't give a damn.

That's probably because that's a very valid strategy... As a veteran myself... you don't get higher renown for stomps. It's based on your score, meaning that longer (closer) matches net more renown.

Sucks that he was stomping you guys, but as it was a clearly unbalanced matchup at least you got out quickly. Just got plat 1 and can confirm it get worse at the top. People take this game REALLY seriously and if you fuck up you will be told about it.  I can barely crack silver... Alot of 30sec potatoe jokes at first loading screen.  TTF2 works a little better for titanfall Not anymore  Just make sure you buy a decent headset for it. Sound is EVERYTHING in this game It's the most strategic shooter I've ever played. Communication and teamwork mean everything in this game (between coordinating breaches or combining reinforcements). If you haven't had a decent team, you'll have trouble having fun. It also heavily relies on map knowledge - if the objective is here, what are likely paths attackers will take that let me sneak up on them? What walls or floors can I shoot through to get an edge on the defenders? Knowing that makes a huge difference. And lastly, the operator you choose will vastly determine your own style of play within the team. If you are feeling particularly wild and want to rush in, you'd take Ash or Sledge. More of a support player looking for that perfect shot down a single hall? Post up with Glaz. 

It's so multidimensional that no match is ever exactly the same, so once you see how *you choose* to play the game, and familiarize yourself with it, it will become immensely more enjoyable. 

Stick with it!  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Head on over to r/Rainbow6 to learn more. The new free dlc is coming out Thursday, so you joined at the perfect time!

You can go to r/R6Steams to find a group, or you can go to https://siegrs.gg I know what you mean, but for a fps that's been out for almost a year to have more players than a brand new cod has never happened that I'm aware of. There are no hackers anymore. They released Battleye anitcheat and there are almost no hackers left. Battleye ensures there are almost no hackers on PC. Personally never seen one. Then you probably don't play enough or joined in late. You get a few 100 every ranked match. If you're new then it'll be a lot harder, but you usually have more than enough time to get 25k between seasons.  I would The sound bounces everywhere, even if the guy is in the next room. This is the only game which makes it a necessity to wear headphones. I'm pretty sure the guys that designed the sound system probably took a long time to create, but I don't like it. Would prefer something more simpler like any shooter out in the market.   "VERE HAVE YOU BEEN ZENDING IT?"  Ugh, let's try something else... ugh Some guy he made a video saying how shit he was or something. But I'm with you, this guys videos arent funny/good to me at all either. Because fuck keemstar! (Who is keemstar?)

Edit: no, really, who is keemstar? Spotted the keemstar fan Why shouldn't he? Did  he  signed  a contract  saying he  has no  right to do videos  on CS Gambling? I'm pretty sure it's his own channel . Spotted the CSGO gambling addict. That's his shtick, he reacts to stuff (milks it when he can), gets views which means money.  Well if you think that way, you can always not watch his videos. He is always well informed and backs his shit up with proper sources and proof. The only way you could be mad at him, is when you side with the people who he calls out on doing shady shit. And boy does he do it well!



He's a master in fucking people up that do shady stuff, and I love that. There is probably a lot you didn't notice.  3. I win good feelin's, and that's pretty okay. Thanks :) Holy shit the rip-offs of games on the Google play store kill me. {-}7 I don't get the reasoning for ranking systems that give a reward based on end of season rank but don't have a decay to discourage smurfs.  literally anything is a "very valid strategy" against free weekenders. lmfao. this one is just particularly douchey vs newbies.  I know it sucks to hear, but it's not your team. I was stuck in bronze for months until I changed my playstyle and started getting 3+ kills per round then just went straight to gold 1 and now it looks like I've hit my plateau. Just saying, unless you're undoubtedly the best on your team everygame, you're probably the reason you're stuck in bronze. or TiF2 or TFa2 kek

People will still be playing TF2 when titan fall is sitting in the $5 bargain bin.

It's engrained in our souls. Wanted to thank you properly! I just picked it up today and it's installing now. Can't wait to enjoy this :D Thanks for the advice! I'll make sure to give it another chance tonight.  Oh holy crap, thank you again for that! I appreciate all the info and will do!!! "I TELEPORTED BREEEAADD" Now watch and learn, here's the deal Look at this net. His sketches are hit and miss but his videos about morality and transparency (youtube heroes, Joey salads, zarna) are all pretty entertaining and in my opinion he usually takes a moral high ground. I don't get how you could claim they aren't at least quality videos. Sure, some of the stuff he has done hasn't been the best, but the guy is practically the saint of Youtube. He started an entire movement to protect fair use rights of all youtubers and helped create a fund specifically for legal battles that other content creators are having to go through, and not even a week ago he helped raise over $140,000 for a guy who was going through really hard times after going viral for being accused of "sexually assaulting" a woman by saying his name was Hugh Mungus. i like him better than just about any other youtube except maybe electroboom... except i hate them all. i fucking hate youtubers and just the whole shitty forced "youtube personality" most of them have. also i hate jump cuts. He is a guy who makes low quality content that is usually wrong and never apologizes for it.  Nope, I don't gamble. I can tell he milks it. He milks everything he can, he's money hungry but good at hiding it. Yeah, this show is insane. There's already so much stuff I noticed on the second watch I had no idea was there the first time. I need to watch it again. No problem. Is the google play store worse or is the Apple App Store worse? I believe Rocket League just introduced a decay for this specific reason. I achieved a decent rank at the beginning of the season across all four modes and then switched to doubles exclusively. After a while my rank was reset in all modes but doubles.  I know it's not my team(always). My head shots suck  Yup, no problem. Everyone gets the new map + updates for free on the 17th, season pass owners get the new operators that same day. For everyone else you will be able to buy the dlc operators for 25k renown (in game currency) starting on the 24th. You slip and slide on this BANANA PEEL! Emphasis on usually

Edit: never question reddits idols, understood. Because it's a matter of opinion and I just don't. never heard of him till today but Fuck That Guy The first step is admitting it. That's a good question, it depends in what way. I overall prefer Google and Android, but if we're talking spam games it's gonna be worse on Google play store cause apple tends to be pretty nazi on what apps they let in. Pretty horrific on both ends tho lmao. Yes. WHAT ARE YOU DOING seems like they're Le Triggered amirite  His content is supposed to be journalistic, or at least news, so it's kind of bad when he's wrong. He's also instigated racism, and accused an old man of being a pedophile and made him cry on camera because he rallied his subs to berate him. I think he also did something about being a dick to a literally retarded youtuber, or that might also have been leafy. Yeah because I'm gonna admit something I don't do. Yes, I am not alone.  Amazing. I shook my head for the entire thing! This should be some kind of achievement.  Do you work at polygon? It's important to note for non-players that this  is actually even *worse* than it looks, as this game (Rainbow Six) is normally extremely "high-lethality" compared to most shooters.  i.e. weapon damage is very high compared to health. Most times you kill someone with one headshot, with a *really* sloppy kill taking maybe three or four body shots.  Ash (player) *should* have killed Echo (enemy) before her feet hit the ground coming in that window.  Failing that, before he got up from behind the desk for sure.

Running around each other like that almost never happens in Siege, if either of the players is any good, even *before* considering the missed melee attacks. The CIA got you pushing too many pencils?  I'm not quite sure what's worse, your aim or the enemy's complete lack of awareness of his surroundings. 

"*I hear gunshots, someone is shooting at me! Judging by how loud it is, they must be close! Better investigate!*" And the game is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. Retire? I'm amazed you had a career in the first place. Well, at least you know you have a career waiting as a stormtrooper... Do you play with a track ball? Blind VS Deaf

Round 1

Fight It was first posted on /r/Rainbow6 by u/Oshwitz. You're really generous with those warning shots man Look Son, this is why you play shooters on PC.

On a more "serious" note, this is hilarious. I don't even play this game, yet you found footage of my gameplay.

Time anomalies confirmed. When you give the controller to your younger sibling and he just starts pressing buttons.  "Lag"  It makes me happy to see R6:Siege hitting the front page. One of the best shooters in years.  Hello Sir.
I am a recruiter for the Empire's Stormtrooper Academy.
We have evidence that suggests that you can't hit people for shit.
This is a quality that all of our elite graduates possess.
We would like you to join us, and together we can fail at killing protagonists together. 
Please Enlist Today! I wish someone missed me that much.  Rebirth of a stormtrooper As the saying goes, that was like watching two mentally disabled people try to figure out how to fuck. This was perfect. It's 4 am and I'm in the airport waiting for my flight, this is exactly what I needed in my life You missed your calling as a Stormtrooper. Cue console bashing.  Actually what silver in csgo looks like Wow.  That was so bad.  I hope he was the last one and other people were watching and screaming.  This is how I've felt on BF1 :( Trained at the storm trooper academy, I see. My face hurts from cringing. That sweeping aim just has to be console/controller I mean, it'd have been easier to kill him than dance around like that.  This is what I imagine it would look like to use a PowerGlove for an fps. As an aging gamer, I can confirm that the struggle is real.

I'm in my mid-30's, and I'm starting to notice that my reaction time and steadiness is starting to suffer while playing MP FPS games. That, and my eyes have gotten so bad in recent years (even with glasses) that I just can't see movement as well as I could.

It sucks, but at least we still have SP games. Is someone from Polygon playing first person shooters again? Turn down your sensitivity chief.  Those knifes should have hit. Time to get a PC. Are you me? This is exactly how I play FPS games that are PvP. 

BTW, what game is this? POTG
 What was this guy's connection? That seems a little ridiculous to not have had any hit markers or anything for you.  Were you recording my own gameplay? This is me playing every first person shooter ever.
 Good to see DarksydePhil still going strong. Hey, we all gotta start somewhere. Console players in a nutshell. Me with a controller right here. Oh yea ! I agree. Time to retire from first person shooters.  Brave of you to show us this. But I was entertained so have my like sir i felt the vessels in my heart constricting In Siege you're better off reloading you and your entire team's primary and secondary weapons before relying on the knife. Time to rage uninstall. You know, it's rude to tell people to uninstall the game, but this is a new level of bad. He's too tanky Polygon plays R6 Siege This just makes me proud if my ability as a gamer. It gives it a feeling that it's more of a skill than just the ability to move the sticks or point a mouse. Me playing Overwatch as Sombra. Happens to me all the time Give up man,. Just give up hahha  This made me mad https://account.xbox.com/en-us/gameclip/54e9e30e-e026-41ec-a8fa-5b6071b3b3a5?gamerTag=gyrocarbine&scid=d2a649c9-5d53-4b5c-8c62-89d87d074cf6
I feel your pain. I did this last night. I think the knife should have killed with the first swipe. At least in COD you could've lunged from two rooms away and got that knife kill.  Yeah, games like RS6 aren't for you. 

Also shows why console aiming is way worse than M/K, although this is pretty shit even for console. I thought this was how everyone on consoles play like. I think it's time to move to pc wtf is that aim It's honestly hard for me to look at shooters being played with a controller or on console.  Way too clunky to do anything.  Just a mess. This is me in bf1 Problems right there, its on console What happened to Aim-Assist????? I thought console shooters have Aim Assist.... No my man, it's time to get a PC.  Perfect illustration of why I will only play FPS's on PC. This is me playing any FPS on a console  Them console snipes This is exactly what happens when I use a controller after acclimated myself to using a keyboard and mouse for shooters. Console players lol  I swear it's easier to kill people in real life than it is in video games. try using a mouse.  pretty clear "oversticking" on the secondary, over left then over right.
  
mouse solves that.  Unless you were using a mouse in which case your screwed. ITT people who don't play this game. This actually happens sometimes. Sometimes hit detection breaks for only one player.  Im yelling "just fucking aim!" This entire gif, knowing id probably do the same that's how I feel in every fps. Omg this hurts so much to watch hahaha
But I've done worse :( Looks like me playing fps-games on console PC vs Console Playing shooters with controller, there you go This is reassuring. Thanks for posting.  Polygon hasn't played six siege since the [E3 demo.](https://youtu.be/6wlvYh0h63k?t=2m15s) Maybe if you weren't hindered by a controller you'd be able to kill someone... Dude halo 6 looks kind of legit... Good time to retire, I hear storm troopers are hiring  Is this the new COD? It looks like it came out 5 years ago.  This is me when I go from PC fps to console. Okay Jesus fucking Christ console aiming I couldn't be this bad at Siege even if I tried really really hard. That shit takes some effort.  [deleted] My shit teammates keeping me bronze bro This is how I generally feel playing a console shooter I think I would break everything close to me if that happen to me Turn down your sensitivity. Take it from somebody who generally uses 9600 DPI then puts it down to 800 for only the one game.

Edit: Just realized it's console, assumed it was PC. Still may want to check out your sensitivity settings though. Story of my entire FPG career. X-Box record that! Time to retire your console.  Which console is this? Console gaming This looks like a console player PoV What game?  This shit happens to me all the time. Some games I have the straightest aim in the world, other games I'll come up behind someone and turn into Michael j fox and can't hold my gun steady then I miss all my shots and get turned on.  this is me playing a shooter on console This was a repost from r/rainbow6 without credit given to he original poster, here is the original post: http://reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/5ecmwq/i_think_its_time_to_retire/ Did OP use to be a storm trooper? you got an anti-aimbot mod equipt..? When a CoD immigrant tries rb6

>Why don't my melees lunge?  Why don't my bullets magnetize?   That might be the single worst display of accuracy I have ever seen, even for console. Definitely time to retire that gamepad and switch to keyboard & mouse.

:D You've found a brother in me too Yea. This is how I play most of the time. I can go 0-30 on any FPS and then all of a sudden have run of 7-8 kills without even getting spotted.  I know right, i watched thinking, hmm did i accidentally record myself playing an FPS.... Man don't worry I feel your pain. Same here, I'll empty an entire gun at someone at point blank and then get one shotted in return. Same here bro.  I don't remember doing this, but I am pretty sure that is me playing in the video.  Indeed you are not. We should all band  together and...well... sorta suck at the shooty games I guess? Let's not talk about my AK spray in CSGO You are not. I don't think I've ever missed that many knife attempts since most games basically lock it on, but the missed close range shots is me more than I'd like to admit. I'd suggest using shotguns or LMGs and spraying. It's frowned upon I think but you gotta do what you can That's me about every time I play and it pisses me off to no end. Seriously. I'm  more impressed that someone could be this bad.

Edit: Everyone keeps chalking it up to the controller which I could see for a novice, but it's not an intrinsic characteristic of the controller to make you bad. I've played on both formats and they're both easy enough to adapt to. I've seen killers on consoles. Blaming the the controller for lack of control is a bit disingenuous. The other player is just as bad. It's basically how I would play if you give me a controller and take away my mouse.

Seriously, dunno what's wrong with me. I do this all the time.  What's the big deal? I mean, shaking your head isn't *that* big of an achievement. I could probably do it for hours. Well, everybody knows that you can't move and aim at the same time. /s  I hate watching previews or review footage where the person doing the demo clearly doesn't know what they're doing. I'm not saying I'm the best, but seriously, it's a terrible idea to have someone who's never played a game before show off your new product.  What kind of question is that? uninstall.exe Is this game any fun to play alone? 
I'm thinking it's not, and that's what kept me from buying thus far As someone who used to play the older games, *that was Rainbow Six?!* I thought it was CoD based on how long they lasted, and even then I was all "huh, that's pretty awful". Or it's lag com... nvm it's skill > Most times you kill someone with one headshot

Isn't that how that usually works? Take it easy on yourself Dutch.  you son oF A BITCH!  *Guile's theme playing in the background* !

^^^what ^^^was ^^^that?  **!** Stormtrooper Edition For every Harlem globetrotter, there's a Washington general.  I don't get this. OP was happy to mock himself, why would you then mock him further?  I've already been in contact! Contrary to popular belief, trackballs are amazing for FPS games (once you get used to it)

Source: Played CSS with a trackball for 6 years and killed butt. Worse, that's a controller. Hey trackballs are awesome and they served me just fine in TF2. Vote to kick u/Oshwitz

1/3 Peel back the veil of autoaim, peer beneath and you'll find most console shooter footage probably looks like this.

Seriously, I can only imagine that even the best console fps players gameplay with no autoaim wouldn't look too far removed from what we see here.

Edit: Seems my comment has riled up a few anecdotal analogue aim aggressors and people who think they know better - but really they just don't read what they're responding to properly. Keep it up lads, you're making my boring workday a helluva lot more amusing. But i'm this bad with a keyboard and mouse, too!

 Im glad I could assist in your boredom  Did you crash? Silvers don't deserve that kind of insult. Cmon they're far better than this This is some copper 1 shit. Well maybe silver on console.  https://account.xbox.com/en-us/gameclip/54e9e30e-e026-41ec-a8fa-5b6071b3b3a5?gamerTag=gyrocarbine&scid=d2a649c9-5d53-4b5c-8c62-89d87d074cf6

Relevant Shake it off Battlecat. I got a cramp in my neck from shaking my head so much. Came here to say the same thing.  He is over-swinging on everything.
 Seriously, those knife attacks were fine. Im wondering why they didn't register. Or a [XIM](http://xim4.com/). Everyones ping was between 60-80

source video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1lTWxpT6A Stolen post but Thanks! You bet me to it Where are all of you fuckers when I play? I get headshot from a mile out while in a jeep Hey, it's me, your brother  what game? We should start a club. Or support group... Username checks out.  /r/me_irl Heeeeeeey, brother.   *You've got a friend in mee....* hey its me ur brother Did he at least wear a condom?  And this is how we get storm troopers Hello brother, it's me, ur brother Phrasing.  That's what my sister-in-law once said. Your brother likes to duck dudes too? Man if I find my brother in some dude one more time... I know, right? On BF 1 I usually suck ass, but when I'm on a roll I easily top the score board for that particular round - next round? To the gutters again. It's weird.  Yeah in bf4 I would top the leader boards with flash and like a 20/30 kill death ratio. Bf1 8 kills 30 deaths fuck all flags... As someone who has played this game a lot... I can attest that it's not OP's fault. This happens a lotttt. Where it seems like knifes refuse to hit, bullets miss even when shot inside the hitboxes, and then the enemy turns around and one shots you without effort.  I don't know why, but I have been playing video games (admittedly somewhat casually) for 25 years, but I am fucking abysmal at them. I only play them on easy mode. My friend wanted to play Contra with me recently and he's like "don't worry if you're not great, I can carry you" and I immediately died like 5 times in the first room.

This is what it looks like when I try to play FPS with other people. He isn't bad - sometimes your aim just goes to shit.  As my father won't stop saying: It's a poor craftsman that blames his tools. Isn't this how playing with a controller typically looks?
 Which makes it worse in every way.
 Nothing's wrong with you.

Mouse is just an objectively better controller for FPS games. Unless you move to aim At war either you aim or you shoot. I will be hated but fuck it..
Yeah, on consoles. same rules apply to the bathroom Giant Bomb had a Gears 4 Horde game play, they streamed from the one guy who didnt know what he was doing, it was infuriating.  Someone (unknown) from Polygon was really bad at playing DOOM in a video they made.  Not the "haha u newb git gud" bad like some reporters claimed people were being, but like, never played an FPS before and generally had no idea that you could move and aim at the same time bad.  This looked especially odd in a fast paced brutal action game like DOOM and was Polygon's only preview video of DOOM at the time.  Would be like if you had a car reporter previewing a new mclaren and they drove it at 30mph slamming the brakes every few feet. Referencing their Doom gameplay footage where the dude playing sucks horribly? Too bad for him it's a console. He'll have to live like this forever. You can always solo queue if you want, but it can be annoying playing with randos in such a communication-focused game Not right now, but finding a team isnt hard and most of the Reddit community is very welcoming, what platform are you on? Solo can be a bit hit and miss. Actually what would be worse is learning maps when solo. You don't have friends learning nice kill spots or places to break a hole in a wall to peak out - and passing that information to you. 

Despite that - this is one of the best shooters I have played in years. BF1, Titanfall2, Overwatch, all sit on my shelf - this one gets more play time than the rest combined.

It is also pretty cheap now. Next decent sale you could probably snag it for $20. I'd say give it a shot. 120+h here playing alone. Tons of fun in ranked and casual The game is most fun with friends playing with you, but if your just playing casual it can still be a ton of fun by yourself but it gets old a little quicker when your alone. I played solo for a few months with no problem.  The only irritating part is when your other team mates are in a party so they can't hear you and vice versa.  Now most of the time I only play it with 1 friend.  Definitely better with friends/communication, but still fun solo. Depends on how friendly you are. If you can make friends quickly while chatting online then yeah it's a great game. However, if you're shy and don't like to communicate I wouldn't recommend it.  Yes I think it is. Playing by self and being communicative with team members is pretty fun. You keep team mates from game to game so if you find people who are good, add them. Keep doing this and adding people who are good. Eventually youll have a bunch of people who are good to play with on your friends list and you have a makeshift clan essentially. I'm a R6 player from the Vegas game.  Loved it and logged countless hours playing both alone and with my mates online.  Had high hopes for the new one and was very disappointed.  Playing offline alone is so limited.   And the skill level of the game has gone way up.  I queue up with myself on xb1, it's not as bad as it seems. Also I noticed whenever I have a mic plugged in I get put in lobbies with people that have mics more consistently. I don't know if that's a coincidence or a feature but it's pretty great! It really is. I thought the same way and I was hesitant before buying the game, but now it's my favorite FPS game of all time. Although if you are on xbox and decide to buy the game, I can help get you familiar with the mechanics. Terrorist hunt is pretty good with other people.  Like any other team based competitive game, you have three options:

1. Get enough friends to buy in so you can play with at least a majority of known skill. So in a 5v5 game, you'll want at least two friends with you. This can be a great way to do it if all you care about is casual fun. Would not recommend competitive unless your friends have the same mindset about getting good as you do. 

2. Join a community with an active player base and play with tj. They will be better players usually because they care enough to seek out other players and thus probably have a more team oriented mindset. There may vets in the community who can accelerate your own progress as well. This is my preferred method because my friends give 0 cares about being good. 

3. Solo until you're good enough/ranked high enough that people play as a team by default. That's how they got that high ranked in the first place. Least preferred method as unless you really love the game, this will feel like and be a grind. I did this in RL and got to superstar. Now when I solo there is 90% chance everyone knows how to play at a high level and as a team. But this took 800 hours. And the first 600 were absolutely awful as far as being competitive goes. But I loved the game and the idea of being good at it so I pushed through.  If you have a mic and some of your team does as well it can be a lot of fun for solo. If you find people with a mic you can usually add them and queue together. 

If you want to play solo without a mic you probably won't have that great of a time.  I just got it like 3 days ago and I'm having fun. It's really intense though so for me I can't play it a lot at a time. It's fun playing alone as well. I still play alone even after having it for about 7 months. I play with people I meet in a match for a couple hours and then play with them later on but I don't stop myself from playing just because no one else is online. 

Make sure you have a decent headset. Used to play with my surround sound only and it was rough.  A headset makes a huge difference.  

Also use a mic whenever you play. 

I play on ps4 and about to on PC.  PM if you're interested in playing and I'd have no problem helping you out. 

Edit: don't buy the starter edition on pc because it takes forever to unlock normal operators.  I play it solo all the time. Still super fun and you can always meet players in game. Get it! The real test is learning the maps. After that it's pretty enjoyable solo. A lot of people saying that it's not fun to play alone, but I disagree. I picked up this game a few months ago and have been having a blast by myself. Only very recently have I convinced a couple of friends to get it as well. I'm on PC, so I don't know what the communication dynamic is like on console, but I find that most other people in my games not only hear callouts and communication, but many respond with voice as well.

I absolutely can't recommend this game enough to people who like strategic, methodical games, FPS games, or team-based objective games. The environment is so dynamic and destructible that there's never a shortage of ways to open up a room. I play PC and I love it. I haven't enjoyed an FPS since Halo 3 (admittedly, I haven't played BF). I've heard some horror stories about console (community apparently is very toxic) but the PC version is great. Hackers are completely gone, no really horrible bugs, content every couple months, great strategy, feels very smooth.

People will complain about how you just can't queue with less than 5 (full party), but it's not true. Sure, you'll lose a few more games than if you were stacked, but it's not that bad. You can legitimately carry if you're good enough and it can be fun even without making friends. PC version has a fantastic community and it's very easy to find a group.

Tl;dr PC version is great. Console may not be.

EDIT: Don't play casual more than you have to. It's full of dickheads and tryhards and trolls. If you're really wanting to be competitive, play Ranked. Doesn't matter if you lose, the ranking system is fairly forgiving. Alone, not really. You could find people from solo queue or join the subreddit, but it's always better to have friends that you're familiar to talk with. I have a friend that only solo queues but he's a beast and gets MVP every game. He thinks it's the best shooter he's ever played. I play it when I go to his house and it's highly rewarding.  I get a lot of enjoyment out of it, even alone. every character has their own specific niche and everyone acts on their character's niche so things usually function. there's a button that lets you place a 3 second waypoint where you're aiming that can substitute *a lot* of communication.

 frustration will almost always come down to how much you can trust your teammates to kill the bad guy before the bad guy kills them. I play this game by myself 95% of the time. It's still my favorite shooter. As long as YOU have a mic you can help your team. Most of the time when people see you have a mic they'll turn theirs on. I've made a ton of friends from solo queue. Don't he afraid, it's a hell of a game.  It depends what you want from the game. It's not a casual game. People get really intense online, which happens in a lot of games. However, siege especially. So, playing with friends tends make the experience better. You can't fuck around in this game like a COD or battlefield game. People will get pissed and kick you. I play alone all the time. 'tis nice. I almost always played this game solo and I'm satisfied with the  ~110h experience My personal experience: not at all. I got it free, but I don't play it. Many people in the solo queue don't communicate at all, but will team kill you if they feel you did something wrong.  They normally last about until 3-5 shots, this is the worst shooting by both parties ive seen since I started playing the game, which I have had since release Yeah--that's why this particular play is *so* terrible that it's frontpage-worthy.  As you correctly point out, it's highly abnormal for Rainbow Six gunfights to look like this, and it's only possible because both players in this clip are jaw-droppingly bad. I had to watch it a second time to see that he missed literally every shot. Thought the same  This is probably the longest 'fight' in Rainbow Six Siege history. Most fights are over in a few shots. Not, "most times, a headshot is a kill," but rather "most combats are resolved by a single quick headshot."  What you got against bitches?  Your comment starts off normal enough, then you just yell "F A BITCH"... **SHOTS FIRED** Hahaha That's a cool thing of you to say I never would've thought.. A pro LoL player used a trackball. 2/3 Which is actually pretty interesting IMO. Because what separates good console players from bad becomes team tactics and game knowledge over twitch reactions and aim precision. It's a lot harder to God clutch a game on console by doing your best aimbot impression, so in some ways the better team wins more often.  It's a lot harder to be precise with sticks (especially with a used controller) than a mouse though, which creates the need for auto aim. Well, no. There was a modifier in one of the Halo games, maybe CE Anniversary, which disabled auto-aim assist, with the message, "trust me, you'll miss it when it's gone." 

I did NOT miss it when it was gone. My gun stopped being sticky (auto-tracking) and the bullets actually went where I told them to. I feel like every game should have that option. I do not claim that I am the best FPS player in the world, but after that experience I have come to hold a high dislike of auto-aim assist in FPS games. Ever seen cs console footage ? Once upon a time, there was a CSGO video posted of console "pro" players. Since the CSGO console game doesn't really have aim assist, it proved your point 100%. They looked like Silver PC players (our lowest rank) and these were "professionals". Except this game doesn't use any aim assist for multiplayer, and this is considered bad by console standards too  So what? Its not like youre a lesser human bc youre not as experienced with fps's in combination with kb+mouse. No worries. Multiple times Am silver, can confirm it's this bad. Not playing probably, I am so bad at mp shooters it was pointless to keep buying them Well we're all on the same team usually :/ I managed to get killed even with the game turned off. AHAHHAHAHA!!! I LOVE IT They're playing a different game. No vehicles in R6 I always wanted to serve Are we still doing phrasing? It used to give me false hope that I was good but just needed practice...that was CS 1.6 This is me. Put me in a tank I usually do pretty good. On foot? Lol. On some maps, I can't miss. Other maps I can't get a tangible effort going at all - Ballroom blitz, I'm lookin at you, you piece of shit.  lucky. I go like 1:6 or 8 and then all of sudden become FPSJesus and go 15:2 or better for a day. welcome to the wonderful world of lag compensation. Or as I call it - multiplayer mode.  Never have issues in campaign, but in mp, shotguns one shot me if an enemy does it, but even 3 shells aren't enough to kill enemies. The problem wasn't the hit boxes here Except in this gif you can see him clearly missing his shots and being too far away every single time he knifes None of that was on target and none of that was lag. I agree that all of those things happen. But they didn't happen to OP.  OP was so bad that he actually managed to miss every last bullet and knife attack.  Playing a game a lot doesn't automatically translate into getting good at it.. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Except this guy is clearly shooting at fucking furniture. Yes, OP should have got the kill during one of those many knife attempts..sometimes the game fucks up and does stupid shit like this There's no shame in playing games in a easier mode, heck I do it and I haven't played nearly as long as you.

I'd rather play through right to the end of a game and experience the story than ragequit halfway in and not get my monies worth- except for the DS series and Bloodborne obviously To be fair, you were playing Contra. I played Madden religiously as a kid (02-07). But I never learned the strategy of good defensive alignments or audibles. I just played for fun. Played online and lost 73-0. That's after probably thousands of hours as a child I mean I agree about mice being better, but that was still some of the worst controller aiming I've ever seen. Crosshair placement was awful. Dude was going for knee shots.

Changing peripherals doesn't change basic fps mechanics.  Everyone keeps saying that but I can't play for shit with kb and mouse, I am relatively good with a controller. For the function that the mouse assumes on a PC rig, I agree with you. I can't handle the keyboard through. Feels so awkward and cumbersome. But what if I aim to move? I put my girlfriend on Farcry 3 on PS3, and that's exactly how she aimed. She couldn't get the hang of using both sticks at once, so would run backwards / strafe left and right until she was aiming at the guy she wanted to shoot. She got surprisingly good at it after a while... I always find it funny when I see gameplay on a console. You can tell right away because the cross hair never moves smoothly, it's always in a fixed position and then moves suddenly up or down. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3pQ0oO_cDE 

the video speech for itself

edit : [here is the complete video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yYp8ZeQ-I8), even more hilarious > Someone (unknown)

Arthur Gies Except you install most console games nowadays (especially if on xbone) Has ubisoft fixed their terrible servers yet? I played at launch cause I got it with my video card, and like 6 months after launch 1/3 of games would still just fucking fail to load because of their shitty servers.

Game was fun, the infrastructure wasn't there to support it, and they !ade it very clear they don't give a fuck about it anymore PS4, is there a sub or something?  ALL MISSED [well even a wheel can be quite good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl35QCbMi-c) 3/3 u/Oshwitz has been removed from the match I respect COD pros just about as much as any esport pro for their true dedication, but if it's hard to clutch in a system mechanic where twitch reactions and aim precision are non-existent, imagine how hard it is in a game where it isn't.

CS:GO will always get my vote for the most technically demanding video game in areas related to athleticism. MOBAs require a hell of a lot as well don't get me wrong, as well as RTS, but I truly believe the reactions and hand-eye coordination required for top tier CS:GO, in addition to the split second critical decision making that lies just a notch beneath MOBAs, create a truly magnificent competitive environment. Aiming is hard as fuck on a controller even with autoaim. It's better that it's worse. Got it. >Because what separates good console players from bad becomes team tactics and game knowledge over twitch reactions and aim precision.

But that's true on PC as well. Everyone has better reactions and aim so it cancels each other out; being able to do a twitch shot isn't a deciding factor if everyone else can do it too. 

Look at high level Quake 3 games. Everyone can aim about equally, so the games are decided purely by strategy. 

You can't "God clutch" more easily on PC. Better controls means it's easier for you to kill your enemies, but it also means it's easier for them to cut you down. I'd say there's still plenty of room between the skill floor and ceiling for console aiming, but yeah, you're right -- much more reliance on tactics and game sense. It is the same either way, assuming matchmaking matches you with players that are around your skill level. If it is a game that requires skill, then, generally, I would be matched with a bunch of other players that can't turn a corner and instantly headshot everyone. So, it would break down to teamwork. If I were actually good, then theoretically, I would be matched with other players who can headshot you instantly as you turn a corner, and again, it would break down to teamwork.

All autoaim does is (generally) make who ever sees the other player first wins. Because you will aim at the other guy first, then just hold down the trigger and auto aim will take care of the rest. We have those types of games, too... they're called strategy games Most recent games do its just on by default and is a pain to find Halo is made from the ground up for consoles, which is the exception for FPS games. Even so, the way they "solve" the controller issue isn't just in the aiming controls + autoaim; halo is a lot less "sharp" than other shooters and requires less speed and precision.

So when you look at it, halo footage from a skilled person with the autoaim off still looks a lot like this, except with different results and probably a smoother camera. Look at, say, CS:GO footage beside it and any console shooter just looks clumsy, whether they land headshots or not. I believe that's what nige111 is referring to.

Autoaim does suck, by the way. It's basically "well we wanted to make you feel awesome shooting things but we can't figure out a way to do that while also letting you retain control" From what I heard there is still some autoaim on, even when you check this option. Might be wrong though. I started out at Silver 1 and I don't recall people playing THAT bad Same, they look so fun! Till I play them, then it's all a question of "why did I think it would be any different".  I hope you don't mean ANY CoD game when you say "mp shooters". Playing CoD today is like going to Taco Bell. It's the same 7 ingredients in different combinations like 8 different times...

Before I get downvoted let me say I've played every CoD extensively. It used to be literally the only game I played because I thought it was so good. Everything past MW2 is a joke. Same, I only play the campaign in shooters. I wish there were cheaper campaign-only versions of games, or that games had longer campaigns. I don't want to spend more than 30-40 dollars for a short campaign.

Yes, I know the campaign is a huge part of the development cost... I just don't like mp. Try Overwatch! There's a whole bunch of characters that don't even need to aim.  Same here man. Played cod and battlefield hours upon hours daily when I worked a shitty part time job. Back then I had time to get good at the shooters. Just last week I traded in Battlefield 1 because frankly I've got no time to get good at these games when I work 12 hour days while juggling a gf and a social life. It's sad but that's reality. Strictly a single player gamer with the occasional fighting game Maybe it's not you but the games. I used to play (and be really good at) games like Unreal Tournament and Quake but these modern shooter games are bullshit one-shot shows that end before you can react to being shot. Halo (specifically Reach for me) was more of a fair game that allowed a lot of 1v1 situations where you can actually fight it out. Today I've been playing Overwatch and I'm actually pretty good at it while I've tried my hand at Battlefield 1 and it's the same sprint-around-and-get-.2-second-kills-before-you-get-killed-yourself garbage.  These days I mostly play Lego video games and my blood pressure has improved greatly. If you can (have a good PC, Xbox one or PS4) you should play Titanfall 2. Should be on sale this weekend. I'm 33 years old, slow, bad eyesight... I can manage 10-14 kills per game, and calling down a giant fucking mech every 5 minutes is fun as fuck. Plus the single player campaign is way more fun than your standard CoD campaign, or whatever BF is bolting on to shit these days.  You can always switch to pc! The mouse is so much better than a controller! It's not as expensive as people say it is, you get better graphics, no more discs, better fps, and many other benefits! Check out /r/buildapc or /r/buildapcforme!  Thing is it wasn't till I moved to Pc that I got any good. On cod on ps3 I would get 3 and 25 matches with good games being 6 and 18. Seems I do better with mouse and keyboard Seems ironic considering that anything above 50 ping is "laggier" than a 200 ping game 20 years ago Why do we punish people with good internet connections?

I'm around a corner, and your bullet hits me because I'm still on your laggy-ass screen? 

What's the logic behind this?! They reworked shotguns a couple patches ago and basically nerfed them all.  I disagree. Games like this have a significant amount of bullet magnetism and knife lunge magnetism, both of which were failing hard in this clip He didn't miss EVERY bullet, but he only made 2 or 3 hits on target so it was pretty much the same thing as missing every shot. dota 2 player here, can confirm > Dude was going for knee shots.

Dude was attempting to shoot the enemy, wherever he possibly could. 

No amount of crosshair placement was going to help if you can't aim Hey, aiming for the feet is a great tactic. With a rocket launcher :/ If you normally play with a mouse and keyboard it isn't easy to suddenly aim with a controller. This is one of the reasons why I knew pretty soon I will not play with a bow in Dark Souls because it took me forever to align the crosshair over the enemy who was standing still.  I'll grant you it takes practice, but when people with consoles go up against people with PCs in competitive multiplayer, consoles get smoked. That's what he meant by objectively better (proven that there is more precision with mouse+KB combo). I regularly play with my cousin (who plays both console and PC - I am PC-only) and he regularly states that mouse/KB is better. http://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-cross-platform-play-for-overwatch-in-part-becau/1100-6432073/

mouse allows players to spin very quickly, being able to adjust your aim so quickly is a huge advantage in any FPS Lots of console games have "auto-aim" where if you get your reticle "close enough" to the target, it will auto-adjust to be on-target.  These are very small adjustments, so many people don't notice.  This is to make up for the inherent lack of accuracy with a controller relative to a mouse.

Most mouse-based FPS (PC-based), *don't* have this feature.  So unless you are playing PC FPS with a controller, you may not be as good as you think. Lower your mouse sensitivty, thank me later Won't work. I aim to misbehave. Does that count? You'll move but you'll miss your aim I played the first level of the Halo 3 campaign co-op with my gf and she had the exact same problem. It's funny cause I always thought it would be pretty intuitive but I guess it's more of a skill.  Dude I have been playing shooters for ages, using strafe to aim horizontally instead of the view stick is a technique I use very frequently, it's extremely effective.  I'd say that depends on who is playing. I for example, never keep the crosshair still for even a split second, because I'm probably having an epileptic seizure. But the cross hair would be moving smoother on console because the sensitivity is consistent? PC mouse control is visibly more 'jittery' because you can alter the speed at which you move the mouse and make a lot quicker 'snappy' movements. You watch shitty people play Wow. I thought people were being overly critical too, but actually seeing it is just..amazing. Like..I really don't want to make fun of the person at all because I'm legitimately concerned that they might only have one hand. Lol'd @ the disabled comments and rating on the original If you're ever looking for some fun with Polygon, always remember that [they sometimes forget what fun is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UujtfN7hCdo). That got really difficult to watch.

It was like they were using the keyboard to aim and just not using the mouse.  If they were using a controller, it's like their first time. Damn. Not sure why you were downvoted...this is the person. He went on a tirade on Twitter about it, even.

I can understand not wanting to shame some random guy for sucking at a game. However, if you are paid to give your opinion on a game to thousands of people, it's going to be hard to take you seriously if you're reviewing a game that relies so heavily on its gameplay and you look like you've just picked up a controller for the first time in your life. he also did the full doom review for Polgyon. not sure how you can even count his review as creditable after seeing his gameplay though. PS4 as well.  I just started playing again after quitting for that exact reason and the servers are much much better now.  There's still problems with that, it was fixed for the most part, but they just recently (like within the last week) released a patch/new expansion that is causing a lot of trouble across all platforms.  In a new patch last week, they addresed this specific issue.

Now when you shoot people in the head, the actually die, also head hitboxes have been extended over the neck aswell - so it is more consintent to get a headshot and prevents false positive issues, where you think, that you shot someone in the face, but actually hit the neck, since the visuals are same for headshots and 'neckshots'.

Also they announced another year of support and dlc. That game just keeps on growing. :P r/rainbow6  Holy shit 4/3 Cs:go is definitely among the most demanding games, but i still think sc2 beats it in measuring raw skill. They're nuts. Watching CSGO pros make shots can be intense.  That's what makes watching guys like Crimsix so fun. Obviously a CoD god but he's pretty fucking good at CS:GO too when he plays during the CoD "offseason". He's just got natural talent What about the old twitch shooters like Quake? I'd say those take even more skill than cs. > halo is a lot less "sharp"

This may be true for Halo 2+, but Halo on PC proved that it was super sharp. I would go 50-0 on bloodgulch pistoling people across the map. There were people running around who could dominate with the assault rifle (could never figure that out, some bursting mechanic).

Sniping was some of the funniest in any game I've ever played. It felt visceral and on point.  Haha, I actually skip multiplayer now because of this. You either suck really bad and get killed all the time. Or you practice and practice until you get really good at it, but then your teammates suck and they make you lose. The only time I have fun with multiplayer now is when I play with friends. that really hit me where I live This is why I usually play medic-related classes. Though I haven't played TF2 or any MP shooter in years, I think my strange medigun had like 2000+ ubers recorded. Some of the games are different though. Voice communication, tactical approaches and teamwork in games such as  Squad, matchmaking in CS, Arma, or Project Reality really makes the whole experience different. 

Run - gun - die gets boring, whats important if you look for a unique experience is staying away from generic shooters and find games that stand out, they still are out there.  This. Right here. I don't play video games much at all anymore  I'm really, really good at literally every kind of video game except first person shooters. I don't get why I'm not good. I destroy everybody else at every other game, but I just flat out suck at first person shooters. Overwatch is so fun  played the first one, im skeptical the second one would be better, at least i could kill bots in the 1st arent they gone in 2? That's because 20 years ago -everyone- had 200 ping, now you've got people with 10-30 compared to your 50. Motherfucker my ping out here doesn't get lower than 200! The problem is that favor-the-shooter systems like what you are describing ends upp punishing people who are good at dodging and getting out of the way by hitting them after they should be hidden.

But at the same time favor-the-target like the type that the people above were describing ends upp punishing people with good aim by making them miss even though they aimed right.

In the end both systems suck but are still necesay. Its either "WTF I was totaly behind that wall!" or "WTF that headshot was dead on!" So are some people still playing without the patch, or able to over ride it somehow?    This game actually doesn't have much if any magnetism to bullets or knives, other games like COD do have fairly extreme magnetism though It's still not the hit boxes fault he's relying on auto-aim to bail him out.  He's missing plain and simple Games like this...

Meanwhile THIS game doesn't have any magnetism or aim assists. Only thing failing hard in this clip is the player's aim Exactly.  This player is clearly used to the auto-aim stuff so they don't have to aim for themselves.  And when auto-aim fails, it's hilarious to see how bad they really are. The fact that the game gave him points proves it wasn't lag because the first few hits registered, he was just plain old shite It's also easier to control mouse aiming on extremely high look sensitivity than it is on controllers - gives you a definite edge in terms of time to aim By better you mean easier? Ofc mouse accuracy is 10 times higher. Movement might be better with a stick. Aim to move sounds like an early 90's/late 80's hip hop song. He's on console so nothing works ^^^^/s We definitely take for granted how hard it is for newcomers to adjust to two-stick movement. I grew up with no aim, then holding a button to aim but not move, then finally moving and shooting. It was a gradual process. 

I really want to put my 4 year old against my wife and see who can kill who first in Halo, but my kid is starting to understand the camera movement thanks to Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare and Disney Infinity, so he'll probably crush her. I've played FPS games since back in the wolfenstein days. I switched to mouse+kb somewhere around '96-'97. In no fuckin way is aiming with a gamepad intuitive, I can't hit anything ever. I'm lucky I found a girl who can use a controller. She's pretty good at GoW as well.  I think its to do with using both hand to do different things at the same time. Like that thing where you pat your belly and rub your head.

Also I reckon not knowing by muscle memory where all the buttons you need to press are really hurts. Came to say this. It's basically a requirement when you set it to high sensitivity. I think what he means is that it doesn't track the target smoothly - it makes several separate corrections which are smooth movements, but the crosshair is all over the place in relation to the target. https://youtu.be/kINidcO-EC8?t=549            
Look at this. Destiny's kid is just as good as the Polygon guy if not better. And the kid is like 4 years old ... I know people with one hand- or that play with their feet- that play better than this. This was complete and utter trash. Otherwise their feewings would get hurt and we can't have that, it's <CURRENT YEAR>! holy shit...i did not know it was possible to be that big of a pussy. dude is literally hurting and scared for his life because he fired a VR gun Right! Can you imagine a car journalist reviewing a Porsche but complaining they couldn't drive stick or that it was too fast? Apples to apples.  4/3 u/Oshwitz has been banned  Lag?  5⁄3 The two aren't comparable honestly. Two completely different skills that are both ridiculously demanding. One requires a very high sense of memory and thought processes to meticulously pre plan and build an army in the most optimal way while also micromanaging upwards of a hundred units and a dozen or so buildings at once while another requires precision aim and muscle memory to hit flicks onto common and uncommon positions that enemies pop out of all while remembering managing defensive and offensive nade spots and tactics with four other people of varying skill levels Yeah but SC2 is hard to follow for anyone who isn't very well invested in the game as a player, which makes it hard to be viable, in time and age where games like Dota2 and LoL have almost a mainstream appeal.

I'm more of a Dota guy than CS:GO, but I believe that, in the end, games like CS:GO are for e-sport what soccer is to regular sports - I don't know shit about soccer rules but I can watch World Cup and be engaged, and be excited.

I think the same can be said about CS:GO because it's pretty simple to follow. Dota/Lol is a bit harder and SC2? Good God. SC2 pros arn't human. The way they flip across the map and do dozens of things at once. This gets into a whole new ballpark talking about the difference between skill, tactic, and strategy of a game. Skill being your ability to perform a head shot in CS, or your ability to burrow roaches just before they die in SC2. Tactic being the ability to react to the current game situation and adjust how you play over the course of 30 seconds to 5 minutes. And Strategy being, essentially, the meta strategy of the game.

Going to pure skill, I'd say CS is more demanding on skill, but I would say that SC2 would be more of an endurance contest of skill, seeing as the games are much longer and have no defined breaks.  Watching jumping back to back awp no scopes blows my mind. The qualities that make a great FPS player great transcend the input type and once learned I think most top tier FPS pros could migrate systems and stay competitive. A lot of people don't know that halo was a PC game before it was a console game. Sure it came out on consoles first, but it was originally developed as a Mac exclusive (I know, I know - take a minute to let your sides come back down from orbit) until MS bought it to be the OG xbox's poster boy. Yeah, any MP game is a million times better when you play with people you know. I never really could get into destiny until I found out a bunch of people from work play too. Now we're on almost every night.  I have a friend that reminds me how much I suck. i stopped playing with him. Now i suck alone.  Yea I don't have the time to constantly play a game to get better at it, but I still want to play games when I do have time. The issue is that when you're playing online some of these people literally do nothing but play that game everyday, so they're gonna be so much better at it. I remember back at school when we had summer holiday, 6 weeks of nothing but mw2. I fucking rocked at that game. I'm trying to get into black ops 3 at the moment but it's impossible  THIS. Totally agreed  I just started buying multiplayer shooters on console.  Controllers aren't as precise as a M+KB, but I can't be precise with either.  It's like equal opportunity sucking. I wouldn't mind sucking. The problem is how you get treated if you aren't super good. I've been kicked from servers before. I've been harassed because my K/D ratio wasn't high enough.

Everything since the original TFC just kind of sucks to me now, and that was only awesome because you could do things OTHER than just trying to shoot the other guy (scouts nabbing flags, demo guys breaching yards, engis building sentry guns and dispensers, medics medic-ing). Even TFC2 didn't have the same appeal. Did this with battlefield 4. I'm regularly at the top of the board unless its a bad game or I just joined in. Get a good squad together and you feel unstoppable. Hope your housing complex is ok. I have altered the deal, *pray* I do not alter it any further Oh! Yes, absolutely. I recently started playing ARMA 3 & realized "Wow! Every other game sucks in comparison" — sure, arma has it's bugs, but the ability to communicate? Oh so sweet.

Just last night I was in a plane in BF1 & had no ability to tell the guy three feet in front of me that he was shooting the wrong direction. I'd either have to hit a key and start typing (while flying the plane, of course) that he needed to turn around. 

I quit. I just shut the app. down, and went back to ARMA where communication is built into everything. I'll take bugs, tactics and communication over 'run gun die (and frustration)' repeatedly.  > 20 years ago -everyone- had 200 ping

If they were lucky. I remember playing Age with 300-400 pings in early 2000s.  That is really not true, at least   At least say 15 years ago.  I would say the average was low 100s on most servers I played on, and there would be several people in the high double digits.  I was in Northern MN and regularly got 150 in most games from say 1999-2004. The person with the shittier connection should lose. 

The goal is low ping, not high ping. 

This mechanic makes people *want* to have a laggy connection, to the point where they will use "hacks" to juke it in, or purposefully join a worse server.

Which is just fucking stupid. No, I mean shotguns still are effective in close range, and all guns can kill in one shot to the head, in the most recent patch they made damage to the arm and legs equal to the body (as it used to deal like half the damage or so). So all of that makes them still strong weapons, but you don't see too many people using them like the snipers they used to be. 

At the same time every R6 patch breaks something that was fixed three patches ago, I'd call it two steps forward, three steps back type of thing, so it could have been changed unintentionally recently too  lol have you never played a video game before? That's not how it works. You can't just "not play on a patch" Whip out your pistol and shoot at a camera quickly in the distance.

I like Seige but it is very generous and random with aim. Definitely are rewarded for being the first one to pull the trigger regardless of aim. Siege doesn't offer auto-aim in multiplayer  Didn't look like he was missing that badly, seems a few shots that clearly would have hit the guy didn't register, as well as the knife completely failing to function properly. That's consoles for ya! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ When you get used to playing with it, it becomes second nature to allow for its compensations.  It's a hard habit to break, but unfortunately shooters on console are pretty rough without it. It's easier because it gives you a much higher degree of control.. thus, better. [It is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) no /s required! ^^^^^^/s You're doing something right I remember when Halo came out and NOT liking the two stick deal and thinking that golden eye controlled much better. This. When I have offspring I won't be satisfied till they can destroy me in overwatch or something. The two stick nonsense is why I gave up on consoles and game strictly on a PC now. I just... I can't do it, man. Twin stick shooters are terrible for aiming. I can still kind of twitch-aim with M+KB in my old age (30) but I definitely cannot twin-stick aim for my life... Pretty sure I've been doing it since about '96 as well! Yeah, for some people it's easy but I can't hit shit unless it's kb and mouse.  Sounds like you're bad at it Played with mouse and kb forever. I thought the same thing. Now I am so used to the gamepad it's not even that bad. I prefer M+K but I'm also pretty good with a controller. I've been doing both forever though so it's really just natural.  Same. Wolfenstein and Doom were my first. Trying to use controllers makes me want to flip tables. Wow holy shit, Nathan's old enough to play games now? Kids grow up so fast. DAMMIT I DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTHING YOU GUYS CMON  >Yeah but SC2 is hard to follow for anyone who isn't very well invested in the game as a player, which makes it hard to be viable, in time and age where games like Dota2 and LoL have almost a mainstream appeal.

Back when SC2 was really popular people had the exact same thought about Dota 2 and LoL **So what do you do in this game?**

"Well, the primary objective is to destroy the other team's ancient, which is like the center of their base, uh, hang on, they might zoom over it at some point, uh never mind, anyways in order to do that you need to level up your characters by farming those little dudes. No, those ones aren't players. Hold on, I'll show you another player when we see one, oh also you need to get gold to buy items to get stronger as well, and then you have to take out the towers before you can get to the main base but you need to wait for your own creep wave before you hit the towers, oh yeah creeps are those little guys I was talking about before, and sometimes you have to kill your own creeps because it keeps the other team from getting gold, and also you want to ward and maybe get some farm before you full push into hey are you asleep?"

**So what do you do in this game?**

"Shoot that guy." Did you see Snax (I think) land three no scopes on Godsend to clutch the round a little while back? Fucking crazy.  > it was originally developed as a Mac exclusive

This shouldn't surprise anyone who knows history. Bungie's games to that point had always been developed for Mac, though Marathon 2 was ported to Windows. great game but the business model ruined it for me... i stopped after that piece of shit expansion, the one where we got an arena instead of a raid

i could not justify buying the entire game and all the expansions again so i wouldnt miss out on emotes... they expected us to throw our money at the tv

https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/132927166 GameStop took my copy of Destiny for $2.00. > now i suck alone.

really? PM me. What do you play? I'm on a 360 sucking hard all day. Could use some company.... 
Seriously, I love to play Black Ops 2 but I am terrible. 2/3's of it is knowing the maps, and the normal camping spots / kill zones. Once you get that down, reaction time becomes less of a factor. I tend to do something I like to call "fishing". I'll shoot through the walls, intermittently, where I know snipers / corner campers are likely to be and look for hit markers. Then I usually end up with a positive k/d .  I don't mean any offense, but it could also be that you're older now and your reaction time isn't as sharp as it used to be. I know that I'm not as quick as I used to be 10 years ago. Annnnd that's why I play borderlands.  thanks, famala high latency isnt much of a problem in Age, compared to any FPS at least.

I remember playing wow with 300 - 400ms (from Argentina to NA servers) and it was fine I used to raid in wow with 1200ms ping. Granted it was vanilla, so I didn't have to do much as a druid Absolutely. The good ol' days of high pings! Both methods reward and punish people who lag.

In fts it's easier to hit people because they are moving more predicatbly on your screen.

But in fft its harder to hit people that are lagging because if you aim and shoot were thay are on your screen (as a person without lag) they wont get hit because they arent actually there. Every gun being a 1 shot to the head has bugged me since this game's release. If I am wearing a military grade helmet, why can a bullet from a silenced 9mm pistol that was fired through a wall and traveled 100 meters before that kill me in 1 shot? Or maybe the camera hitbox is just bigger so it's easier to hit from distance? Exactly Rb6 on consoles don't have auto aim Yeah gamepads are not a good fit for fps. Damnit you!  /sigh...I should have known better Yes! He's back! Got me. I can't believe I fell for it My older brother wouldnt even try to new two stick movement of halo, he was stuck in the goldeneye mindset. Thats when i knew that he would forever be left behind and die with the old ways...

Still has never learned to use them. C button movement, inverted stick aim. I owned my circle of friends at goldeneye.

Wasn't too hard to make the switch after playing like that for so long. Non sense? Weird how its just second nature at this point  "Twin stick shooters" =/= first person shooters controlled with a gamepad.  
Twin stick shooters are top down arcade style games.  http://store.steampowered.com/tag/en/Twin%20Stick%20Shooter/ The only reason it works so well for a lot of people is the aim assistance in some games to compensate for acceleration.  Try playing PC with a gamepad vs its console counterparts and you'll notice the difference. I tend to get along fine with both M/KB and controller but the one thing I've found is sniping, I can't hit a damn thing on controller and used to get crushed in Halo whenever my buddy grabbed the sniper but put me on mouse and I'm fairly equal to most people. Point at him. Point at him and laugh. It's really easy to be bad at something that is handicapped in the first place The only reason it's not bad is because console games have extreme levels of aim assist.  I guess I just never got into it. I stopped playing consoles seriously after the SNES. You want to go flip tables anyway? Sounds fun.  Maybe that is the problem >DAMMIT I DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTHING YOU GUYS CMON 

And there's your problem... For AFK and grieving.  Well, maybe, I didn't follow e-scene back then so can't argue on that point, but the main point I have is that CS:GO is the game that is the most readable for an outsider. I just got sick of the grinding. Bungle swears up and down that "it's not an MMO!". Oh really? Then why am I spending all my time running in circles collecting resources to upgrade one stat on my weapon that will be obsolete by the time I collect all the necessary bits? Why is it then? A Sort-of Massively Multiplayer Online First-Person Shooter? An ASOMMOFPS? I ain't got time for that. My Steam library is calling. Then the one after it was the price of a full game. Fuck that. And now everybody is rolling in micro transactions. The taken King changed the game completely. To me, the game is a solid grade A game now. The only complaints are skilled base matchmaking and seasonal events being about microtransactions I still have an original xbone copy. I don't not intend to upgrade to new version. Sad for me. I wasted money on a game that has the world's worst video game model. I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to play CoD with you, /u/space_reaper yeah, cum over bro Yea I was thinking that, but still I'm only 23 so not exactly old. Must be all the weed I smoked in my college years  > favela

FTFY Yep. In vanilla I played on oceanic servers because I didn't know any better and I regularly had 500+ping and it didn't bother me a bit Most of the time I played wow I played with 1000-1500ms and always tried to pvp [Is it anything like this?](http://i.imgur.com/A7WnIiH.png) > But in fft its harder to hit people that are lagging because if you aim and shoot were thay are on your screen (as a person without lag) they wont get hit because they arent actually there.

If they're the one lagging, they should still be in your crosshairs even if they think they moved out. In a game where you get killed all the damn time, you should *never* die to someone because *they* were lagging. If one person is lagging and everyone else is fine, that person should be missing their shots and dying when they get to cover, not anybody else. Is that why they can't hit anything? I find your lack of aiming disturbing... Huh, didn't know that! Thanks for the education. Seige doesn't have aim assist. I can't I'm using a controller :( [:D](http://i40.tinypic.com/2yz084j.gif) well of course. But I went from: "fuck this I will never play a fps with a gamepad" to "I am having fun, it's not that bad". The reason it's "not an MMO" is because it has servers with a max of 12 people who are matchmade under the hood in instances. There's zero player economics, zero competition for resources and it's not an open world. It's not even the same type of game.

Even Battlefield has over five times as many people in a game. Just because Destiny has a terrible grind/RPG elements does not make it massively online.  And then when you do upgrade it and unlock it, they nerf it to hell in the next patch and make it useless. Looking at your suros regime and hawkmoon.... 

I love that game but its been so misshandled its hilarious.  That full price expansion totally changed the game though. Way less grind, actual story, a REALLY fun raid. The microtransactions are only for skins and emotes which is exactly how microtransactions should be in games. Might suck his dick though  I smoked a lot of weed in highschool and I seriously think I fucked up the development of my brain.  I'm 23 too and took a break from cod through college. Was having some trouble getting back into BO3 this year but once I got back into it I realized my reaction times were better than they ever were...it's just the steep learning curve and maps and general twitchiness you have to get used to again. But now I'm better than ever. Are you on PS4? there's always one of you🐛 The only time latency was an issue on wow was during PVP. Having some dude circle you while you're lagging makes them pretty damn hard to hit. Haha, no you didn't. There weren't actual oceanic servers until like, 2014.  Yeah. Contrary to popular belief it's possible to acknowledge that a mouse is superior for aiming and still enjoy console shooters. I can't play Destiny the same way I play Overwatch on PC but I still had fun with it. Chimps are smart as fuck but at the end of the day they still gotta wear diapers. Plus I heard they can lose their temper and beat the shit out of you with their super monkey strength That moment when a chimanzee can play on the Vive but you are to poor to afford one. Kinda ballzy letting a chimp play a smashing game next to your tv isn't it? Man, can you imagine trying to change a chimpanzee's diaper? Where does one acquire a chimpanzee tho? Most of the time I don't put on a diaper when I play on the Vive. Interesting that he seems to have better spacial awareness and balance than any human I've seen wearing a VR headset Isn't this how The Lawnmower Man starts? This makes me want to go play Bloons Tower Defense I dunno man. This just looks like it could end up very, very badly. Are you TRYING to create the Planet of the Apes? That monkey is going bananas. I'm more interesting in the fact that Monkey has the situational awareness to realize there's a screen on his face creating artificial imagery that he can manipulate. How does he understand the concept but not my mom... Interesting facts: 


1. This chimpanzee's name is sugreeva ( watermark in gif ). 

Here is his Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sugrivathechimp/ 

2. They ( FL Myrtle ) have one more chimp  named: Vali 

3. Vali and sugreeva both name are from Indian mythology. Both of them were superpowerful. Vali had the superpower to absorb half of the strength of his enemy.  Sugreeva was Vali's bro but because of some confusion both became rivals. Sugreeva defeated Vali in the end ( by cheat though ). 

 First, I am fucking terrified of chimps in houses, in a zoo or sanctuary not that bad but a chimp in a house scares the shit out of me.

Second, this doesn't seem like a good idea because what happens when he decides he wants to play it but you left the zombie game in....

Edit: a word This new FunHaus video is great! Does anyone else find it creepy how *human* monkeys and apes are?  Like it's unsettling.  They are practically people. Why are there so many paintings of Hindu gods on the walls? If his name is Caesar please stop training him. When he masters swords we're fucked Dude wtf. I know the Vive is expensive, but the price is going to be astronomical once I adopt a chimp to complete the setup.  Set him up in VR porn for science  Now just put it on a dog and put it in a world with squirrels. This seems like a really bad idea. Anyone else notice how he kept his hand on the headset the whole time - leads me to believe he was aware this reality wasn't real but it was a willing choice to let it exist. Haven't people learned that chimps should not be pets? They will get big and they will bite your face off. Original https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/5dxr72/chimp_testing_out_vr/ This is a really religious (Hindu) household that has a chimp in diapers playing in VR, probably confused by the change in its reality - having a good time nevertheless, while on a leash!
I am not sure how I feel about any of this.. This guy can afford a chimp and a VR setup, he's winning at life.  Great. Even a chimp got to use VR before me. Isn't this how Planet of the Apes started? 

How long till that Chimp reprograms those bubbles into humans? Just as a caution, it's questionable whether or not this is good for the chimpanzee. The place this was filmed at, Myrtle Beach Safari | TIGERS, has a questionable history. [It was investigated by the USDA **23** times between April 2013 and June 2016](http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/%2032143305/myrtle-beach-animal-%20exhibit-under-federal-%20investigation). PETA has called it a ["Highway Hellhole"](http://www.peta.org/living/entertainment/deadly-destinations/) and encourages people to avoid it. [The Humane Society](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2015/01/ok-va-exotics-investigation-012215.html) did an investigation where they note:

> T.I.G.E.R.S. is a substandard facility that breeds, trades and exhibits big cats and other exotic animals, and has built a **large and very profitable business by charging the public exorbitant prices for tours and photos with young animals**. When one of the investigators accompanied the owner of Tiger Safari to T.I.G.E.R.S., she received a behind-the-scenes tour where **she witnessed dozens of adult tigers crammed into cement horse stalls in a darkened barn.**

The point I'm trying to make is; this may not be healthy for the chimpanzee and we shouldn't assume the people in the video know what they are doing. Sorry, chimps aren't pets and they will eat your face Do you want Lawnmower Man to happen?, this is how you get Lawnmower Man to happen. Finally we know what Sean Murray as been up to. #Stop monkeying around!!

 it always amazes me how much chimpanzees and orangutans are like us. you have to be a real monster to harm animals like them These guys got a fucking VR headset AND a monkey. They know how to party VR, chimp, Hindu velvet paintings, and some dude in camp pants?  This is one of the most random assortments of things I've ever seen. Can we not teach chimps to stab objects with swords? Yeah... that would be great... Poor chimp.  A fucking chimp got to play with VR before I did... Why is it I can train my cat to use a litter box but chimps have to ware diapers?  how is it still tracking with the chimp covering like 10 sensors
 DID YOU PEOPLE LEARN NOTHING FROM "Ape Escape"??????? When will you learn???? Animal testing Who has a pet monkey all willy nilly like that? Is that laxmi and saraswathi I see there  Great ... now even a monkey has had a VR experience that I have never had.  That is sick Now try taking it away from him. They'll pull your dick off like it was a piece of melted cheese hanging off your tuna melt. It's easier to imagine when you see [how ripped](https://youtu.be/_MiL8xylgbM) they are under that hair.  Hello! Thank you for subscribing to Chimp facts!

Did you know.... An aggressive Chimpanzee will bite or tear off a prey or an aggressors digits, genitalia, and eyes first to disable them for the kill? SSsscary! This has happened to [many people NSFL] (http://www.nydailynews.com/news/man-lost-face-05-mauling-hell-new-chimpanzee-victim-article-1.364450). Don't pretend they are pets and you'll be alright.

Have a nice day! > beat the shit out of you with their super monkey strength

I saw a few films about that. Scary shit. James Franco was in one. There was a video by someone semi famous I remember..he was talking about the time a friends chimp attacked him and it messed him up.  He ended up pile driving the chimp on its skull before it submitted.  Then it was on the couch eating cereal > Chimps are smart as fuck but at the end of the day they still gotta wear diapers

Same goes for Stephen Hawking but I don't see you dismissing him with that same statement. Ape Yeah, they can be pretty dangerous

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_(chimpanzee) If it is a female chimp the chances of this is low. If it is male things like that can happen It'll be socially screwed and left rocking back and forth in a sanctuary somewhere one day when this idiot realises an adult chimp is something that might just kill you. They also tend to be loud and they like to mess things up. This is a very young chimpanzee. You can tell by its white face and hands. As they get older the white turns darker They also sent a chimp to space

tfw when you're just a poor human You can play on a Vive too. They have demos set up everywhere. 

I'm willing to bet that chimpanzee doesn't own that Vive. Dude it only costs about 1 refrigirator  I know right, chimpanzees have gone up in price at Wal-Mart. I said this in a previous comment. But, I'm a beyond broke college student, as in I'm 21 now and I've had to work since I was 15, broke college student, and I was able to get one. It's just all about managing money and making sacrifices. For 8 months I didn't go out or do anything that cost money, and I switched to a corn dog only diet, so food was only $6 a week. And, eventually I was able to save up for it.

**Edit:** since everyone is so set on being an asshole and trying to make some point that just because I made major sacrifices, including with my nutrition as most people would never do that (nor do I suggest doing it, I was only eating ~1200-1400 calories a day) So, you can argue all you want that I'm not broke. At this point I don't give a shit, you're all just being assholes. I had been wanting a VR headset since I was a Sophomore/Junior in high school when I first heard about them (~6 years ago), and once I finally found out I could potentially afford one, I made some major fucking sacrifices to afford to have my dream. I worked my ass off to get my PC and the headset, and I sacrificed so much to afford these. You can all be assholes all you want, but when you only make less than ~$2,000 a year, then yeah, I'm broke.

And, here, because this is relevant in explaining that further:
http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5dz0ci/_/da8qw9l

It was my dream to own this headset, and I'm not going to let y'all assholes make me feel like shit for it. Fuck y'all.

**Edit #2:** I never told anyone to do this, I was just saying that you could be poor at a certain standard of living, but there are probably sacrifices you can make. Like not going to the movies. Not buying a video game. Using coupons. And, then save that extra money you don't spend. That's what I did and that's all I'm saying. I'm not telling anyone to do this. I was just making conversation, but then everyone decided to be an asshole. But, I'm happy and enjoying my life right now. And, I don't need any assholes on the Internet to tell me otherwise. I'm done arguing or explaining myself. 

I'm sorry for even commenting in the first place...  If you can afford a Chimp pet, I don't think you really care that much. [I'm an "intelligent" human that smashed his 70 inch tv playing the vive....](http://imgur.com/ROkV7Fe) Not when you are so rich you don't even think about the existence of money. Yes. It seems crazy that I can get my cats to shit in a box but you can't teach a chimpanzee to it would be fucking garbage. 

Like some sort of super-smart, strong-enough-to-fuck-you-up toddler. 

Normally, when you're dealing with someone who's wearing a diaper, they're weaker than you AND willing to have a diaper on em.

I've got no fucking clue bout a chimpanzee. 

Would they like the diaper?

Would they like the diaper to fucking much? 

THERE IS NO GOOD MONKEY/DIAPER SCENARIO.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWo-2BtBc7s *poop joke* The same people who can afford a Vive

Edit: twas a joke guys You have to pre-order the game. I will wear my monkey outfit if I get to play on a vive.  Looking at the decorations in the room....an oil rich region. One where everyone has a sports car and a real cheetah as an accessory to that car. Pre-order bonus. Unless you're in for the long haul. Yeah, why would you need diaper when you have socks. Maybe it wasn't his first time with it on. When he immediately reaches out for the controller and how he knows to hold it on his face indicate that. Most of the uneasy people vids are from their first time trying it.  The thing was reaching for the remote like, "oh yeah! VR time. gimme dat remote. time to pop some god damned balloons" Interesting point. All other people I usually see take time to even move from one spot.  First thing I thought of too.   First a chimpanzee, then a ruggedly handsome autistic guy... It's only a matter of time before [this happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NblUhm2Hd3Y) Can you explain this joke? Holy shit this is literally the futurized version of Bloons... I was thinking, "who would give a chimpanzee a sword?" It already is. He's going ape shit!  I'm NOT a monkey inb4 a world of monkeys controlling robots via Virtual reality. Imagine a VR game like grand theft auto and a monkey controlling the character. At first the monkey will run around punching people and hitting cars with his hands, but give them a few months, and they will begin to get in cars and drive around, give them a few years and they will understand how to evade the police. And finally we can train them to go bowling with Roman. I'm pretty sure he doesn't know that I was wondering about this as well. Obviously the monkey comprehends the virtual world and how to interact with it. But does it implicitly understand that it is virtual? Can the monkey differentiate between the virtual world and the real world? Psychologically very, very interesting imho. Even though the monkey has zero understanding of technology, somehow it understands the basic concept. Your mom is great at a lot of other things. How do you know if that monkey understands your mom or not?  dude, yes! the house is also covered with paintings and idols of Hindu gods and goddesses.  > ( by cheat though )  

That is the layman's perspective, if one doesn't read the history completely.  
Sugriva takes Rama's help, who shoots Vali from a hidden place while Surgiva & Vali are fighting.  
Vali, just like everyone else, questions the ethics of this (it is the mark of a warrior to fight face-to-face, not from behind) while he lies dying.  

After Rama answers each of his questions, he is completely satisfied at his comeuppance (Vali had kidnapped Sugriva's wife, along with other atrocities, for a minor mistake Surgiva did), and hands guardianship of his own son to Rama & Sugriva, before dying peacefully. >First, I am fucking terrified of chimps in houses, in a zoo or sanctuary that that bad but a chimp in a house scares the shit out of me.


This chimp is very young, and not really that dangerous. He won't be as strong as a man yet, and would be controllable.


You're right though that, sooner or later, that chimp is going to get too big and strong for a human to handle. Which is true of most exotic animals, and is a major reason why keeping them as pets if a fucking *stupid* idea.



That's not even considering all the major psychological problems that are likely going to follow that chimp for the rest of his life, long after his "owner" has to give him up to a sanctuary (or worse, a zoo) because he can't control him any more. Good luck on getting that Chimpanzee to navigate explorer.exe to the disk. Some people forget that we are just another animal. We share a lot of genes with anything from banana to apache helicopter. Humans are one of the seven species of the Great Apes family.  We share a common ancestor with a chimp and it's our closest related cousin. I believe our DNA matches up at 99% too Well, there's not really a whole lot to separate us other than our knowledge of complex tools, many 'human' concepts can be taught to monkeys and apes, they can learn sign language and understand the concept of currency, if taught they can do most of the things we can, though not *quite* to the same level we can.  

Though, considering evolution, there's entirely the possibility that in the future monkeys and apes could be at the level we currently are, without the whole Planet of the Apes thing. It's probably more about how ape-like we are. It's brilliant. It's not creepy, it's comforting to know that science is correct about evolution and the proof is here in this gif They get worn and scuffed if you put them on the floor. The chimp is named after one of the Hindu monkey gods as well: Sugriva.  Curious , I was thinking the same thing.  The guy who runs the place is very very into Hindu culture. He even changed his name to reflect it (or maybe it was his given name, I don't remember).  First you gotta make a chimp porno..... It's a chimp at a sanctuary, someone figured that out because of the watermark original? you do know thats gallowboob right?  This is in the US, and the family is just very into Hinduism. They run a wildlife park.  Hard to tell if it's safe or not without doing it. Says a chimpless pet owner Probably the same reason we can teach six year olds the difference between where/were/wear/ware, but we can't teach you.
 So elegant. Throw it in the tall grass never to be seen again [deleted] Pull it off and throw it in the tall grass never to be seen again. r/nocontext Wow they're basically Orcs This is the first time I've seen something like that, and all I have to say is What The Fuck...

Not only are the muscular as hell, but each pound of muscle on a chimp provides quite a bit more strength than each pound of muscle in a human.

Really gives you perspective. It's like retard strength x10. That looks frightening. Imagine falling into that pit. No harambes there. I don't understand how anyone can deny humans are related to these guys. I don't want to turn this into any sort of a debate (but this is Reddit, I'm preaching the choir I'm sure), but they're almost disturbingly human. Now I miss Harambe again.

Denied him entry? Wtf? >The locally famous chimp allegedly bit a woman who stuck her finger in his cage in 1999 and had to be removed to an animal sanctuary

WTF? Why do people think it's okay to put their fingers in a chimp cage? And then why do they decide to move him to an animal sanctuary?

Those animals are smart as hell and obviously bonded with the family. That's like pulling a child out of its family's home and moving it into an orphanage. Fucked up, all because some bitch thought she could put her finger in the cage and couldn't deal with the consequence.

 "I remember hearing someone say, 'Might as well just take him to the coroner's office,'"

Oh, fuck that. I wonder if the owners of this chimp with the HTC Vive think theirs is incapable of such rage. Chimps belong in the wild, not a fucking living room. >He said his New Year's resolution was to stop crying and get out of the house every week.

/r/meirl Bonobo's FTW.  They'll just have sex with you if issues arise. Oh fuck STOP.  In this world gone mad, we won't spank the monkey- the monkey will spank us.

This chimp is from the Myrtle Beach Safari...  Turns out it is a sanctuary. [removed] They took our jerbs Nope, the monkey bought it himself, [he got a summer job to afford it.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeSQ5Rv7eH8) The closest to a 'demo' I have is a place where you have to pay 5€ then you're allowed to play a Vive game for 2-5 minutes, which is kind of bullshit. It's 150km away from me too.

The closest to a real 'demo' that is free and longer than 2-5 minutes is in Stockholm.. (I live in Estonia) >They have demos set up everywhere.

Doctor: it seems like most of your problems stem from an all corndog diet for eight straight months when you were younger.

Srry_: *stares out the window fondly.*

 If you have $2000 worth of gaming equipment, you're not "beyond broke". Priorities, I guess. But why? Yeah games are fun, but there's a fuck ton more to life than them. I couldn't imagine saying no to doing stuff with friends because I was saving for a VR headset... OK, I can get that bit. But you shouldn't sacrifice eating nutritiously for the sake of a game. If you've bought a wild animal, I don't think you're smart enough for care. Wait, a pet? You're telling me this guy is not a researcher, just stupid enough to keep one in his house? >Vive  
>70 inch TV

Hey it's me ur brother Username checks out  "I don't know what it is, but I'm pretty sure I've got a lot of it." thanks me too I don't think the issue is training one to shit in a box, it's training them not to throw said shit around after they shit in it.  Why would a chimpanzee go through the effort of shitting in a box when it could just shit on the floor and humans would clean up after it? I think that's easy to explain. Cats naturally dig their poop into the ground. Chimps shit where they please and do with it as they please. Also chimps have huge egos. Imagine the most egomaniacal human you know and multiply by 10.  What if the diaper is full of diamonds, and the monkey is actually a **sexy lady**? Ah, so about like changing a human baby's diaper. Jeeeeeez she reeeaaaaally didn't want that nappy on, did she?   I bought a Vive. Best gaming peripheral ever. I wanted VR since the 80s so I wasn't waiting any longer. Gotta treat yo self once in a while. 

I know they cost a lot now (especially when you take the cost of a high end PC into account) but in a few years time (4 at the most) the costs on both side will have dropped significantly whilst the tech will continue to improve just like it has with all other popular tech. 

It'll be as popular as any other gaming format soon enough. 

Edited: too many monkey jokes.  Dude they're like $800.  A basic refrigerator cost more than that. It's the only way to play in VR Those are definitely Hindu deities. So India maybe?  little known fact that all arab oil sheikhs are hindu  SAO got a lot more creepy all of a sudden. Not to mention animals don't really worry about breaking shit around them.  yea theres another video posted yesterday of the same chimp using it Let's be honest, we are all the guys who would rather sit and play. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawnmower_Man_(film) The same people who give knives to crabs. [or an AK-47](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GhxqIITtTtU) Good thing they got that diaper on him.  Hey! It's me your monkey. she's really great at knitting actually. she makes awesome apple pie and sucks a mean dick. Speak for yourself. Us banana people don't affiliate with those "Apache helicopter" special snowflakes Its also possible for cats and dogs to achieve sapience of that level with enough time and adaptation. The probability however is very, very low. We are *literally* apes. Not ape-like. We *are* apes. It has nothing to do with creationism.  The creepiness is that we have a bunch of furry, super strong five-year-olds running around our rain forests, and sometimes we capture them, put them in diapers, and place them in boxes for our bare-skinned five-year-olds to look at. Find a Bonobo documentary and its all good. that's where I saw it and nothing popped up on reverse searches. Someone already linked that its from Myrtle Beach Safari. I have no idea what a gallowboob is but it doesn't sound like a good time. Bravo. That's what you get for sticking your banana in a chimpanzee's tuna melt I suppose You mean *eloquent*.  That big bright red booty Mo monkey pussy for me! Ima stay home with chimchim > they naturally attack your face, digits and genitals first

That's the part that I think is scary, a person will beat you but probably won't kill without good reason, an ape will cause permanent debilitating damage. It's probably reasonable to assume humans were as instinctively barbaric at some point as well. So they're exactly like humans only stronger. I want you look at Bonobos it'd scary how close they are to humans I saw a bunch just lying down and it looked like one of them was telling the others a joke.  Fuck that. I'll throw a left hook and a straight right at that mother fucker if he comes at me. That chimp will do nuttin' My god, you're right Shit that's terrifying. Now we just need to paint them green and give them guns. ME GO FACE? 

YUP Uruk-hai* A majority of animals look pretty horrifying without hair Yep. That's enough Reddit for today. I think because of genetis, chimps won't get much bigger than they already are.

Muscle is very expensive when it comes to survival, it takes calories to sustain, but muscle, in regards to a chimp is also required for survival. Therefore, the baseline they have is near to their genetic max already.

Human brains takes up a lot more calories than a chimp (25% vs 8%). Our genetics dictates that muscle is not needed for survival since we can make tools and don't need strength to survive, which is why our muscular baseline is not quite as high. Instead, more calories is used to fuel our very expensive brains.

Now, put us in a gym with a caloric surplus, and the body will give the OK to build muscle.

Do the same to a chimp and??? It'd be interesting, but I don't think they'd get bigger. I hear they're prime m8s You've been on Reddit for two years now. Let's be honest, you've long given up expecting anything whatsoever.  Well, technically you saw ape nuts. The day isn't over though.  It's not the muscles themselves so much as the way their nervous system works.

Human beings have a lot of fine muscle control (which is why we can do things like brain surgery or other delicate work) and this means that we don't engage all of our muscles **to the max** when we move our bodies. 

Chimps on the other hand, don't have this fine degree of control, so their movements engage more muscles all the time (as a side note, it's also very energy inefficient, but then again they're lower down the evolutionary scale than we are).

If you ever lift weights, or weight train, a lot of your "gainz" actually don't come from just building more muscle mass, but also neurological training - literally training your body to engage more muscles and shift/move the weight better when you engage. An average person can usually increase how much weight they can lift by 50% to 100% within 2-3 months from starting from scratch and that doesn't mean they doubled their muscle, just that they mostly trained their bodies to use the muscles they **do have**. Makes sense. They're probably around 10x more retarded. Wait a second... how do you know a retard's strength x10 that of a human. Have you fought with a retard that was 10 times your strength or have you fought with 10 retards at once? I can tell you that a retard's strength is 10.786 times that of a human.

It means you will die here, get your ass to a trauma center.  That's more WTF than what the chimps did. The only thing I can think of that might make it justifiable (maybe) would be if the first two hospitals simply didn't have the appropriate facilities or staffing. They do mention that he was taken by a trauma center. But even then... it's understandable tho, he was bleeding all over their clean floor.  
 Presumably didn't want the death to count against their stats

Edit: this is a gaming joke See: Harambe YOU ARE THE ONES WHO ARE THE BALL LICKERS! Actual story begins at [0:52](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=udGAapx7Gok&t=52s)—quite a lengthy intro! Nice!

Not even. I have no idea where I would go for that. That actually made me laugh out loud. Glad someone else gave you gold for that, you deserved it hahaha.  If it's taken him years of sacrifices to save up that $2k, then yes, he could easily be broke an have that. It's all about priorities and sacrifices.  I mean, I bought my computer off of Craigslist for $400. And, I needed a powerful computer for my major, since I'm in computer science and was wanting to specialize in video game design. And, at that time I was working full time, and after 2 months of saving and eating only at my dorm buffet ($150 a year) I was able to afford it. So, again. Still beyond broke, but I just didn't do shit and saved up money. 

We can argue this all day, but think about it. I'm a college kid on financial aid and scholarship, so I don't have to feed a family or anything like that, and $20 not spent, is $20 saved. And, do that enough and next thing you know you got a nice PC, that you watched Craigslist for weeks for, and a nice VR headset.

I live in France a we got a pretty good refrigerator and it cost 300 euros A refrigerator is a necessary appliance for modern, 1st-world society that lasts 15+ years. A Vive is a luxury entertainment device that will be obsolete in the next 5 years.

Not everyone can afford a Vive, that shit is pricey. Like 3 months of car payments+insurance pricey.  A basic refrigerator is 3-600$.  I got my fridge for like NZ100.  It's a Kelvinator.  Probably older than I am. Super basic, does a great job.  CHECKMATE.


Seriously though who spends US800 on a "basic" fridge?   I don't know where you get your chimps, but in Toronto they *start* at $950. Where do you buy your refregirators?? I got mine for 250 and even that felt expensive You forgot the 1500$ computer  Refrigerator is also a critical appliance in most homes.  Wut? My fridge/freezer cost me like, £200, as opposed to the £700 price tag for the Vive... Yeah but you pretty much need a fridge. Plus you gotta factor in the expensive graphics card you'll need to run it. And the games cost money.  \+ PC cost It's an animal sanctuary in myrtle beach.

same with us You missed your chance to say "an ape will go apeshit". When we organized LARP events, we stopped giving full costumes with masks to our "actors". The players would go crazy and hit only the hands, crotch and face. Usually, they would hit the arms and legs when fighting humans.

> But the "five times" figure was refuted 20 years after Bauman's experiments. In 1943, Glen Finch of the Yale primate laboratory rigged an apparatus to test the arm strength of eight captive chimpanzees. An adult male chimp, he found, pulled about the same weight as an adult man. Once he'd corrected the measurement for their smaller body sizes, chimpanzees did turn out to be stronger than humans—but not by a factor of five or anything close to it. Well, their threshold for what wouod be the human equivalent of "snapping" is far lower to non-existent. The difference here is gigantic, actually, because animals don't waste time realizing a threat.

One has to put into consideration that most people (in the western world at least) are quite... let's say soft ... which can be a huge disadvantage when shit hits the fan. People usually don't go all-in, because they don't want to hurt someone due to the unnatural fear of physical pain, which means someone who lacks this fear will have a huge advantage over most people, no matter the situation.
 You can reason with a human, but a chimp.... ERE WE GO BOYZ!
 RED, GOES FASTA! I think you mean give them the blood of a demon. [Like bears](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/04/article-1225042-0711BCAC000005DC-579_634x428.jpg), which you could be forgiven for mistaking for a chupacabra or something if you ran into one at night. Sounds right but I don't know enough about chimps to disagree  if im understanding this correctly, THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GET SMARTER! Put one on a high dose of testosterone and hgh and igf-1 as well as a very big caloric surplus and I'm sure they will get crazy hooge and unbelievably strong. But of course this is highly dangerous for the chimp and its handlers, as well as extremely unethical. Sounds like the words of someone who doesn't even fucking lift brah. Yeah, you're right... Aye, that's what I meant with more strength pound for pound. They have greater access to it! > but then again they're lower down the evolutionary scale than we are

No they aren't. they are simply a different branch along the evolutionary timeline. The traits that the chimps evolution favored were muscle and environmental versatility. They evolved to live in the wild, we evolved to live in a society where we push nature away, instead of live alongside it, like chimps.

If a chimp, and yourself we both cast out naked in the middle of wilderness, I guarantee that the chimp would last longer than you. Making you the less fit one for that environment.
and from an outside observer, that would make the chimp look "more evolved" > ... lower down the evolutionary scale than we are.

I just want to point out real quick that this is a misleading way to phrase this. Chimps, along with all other currently living organisms on earth have evolved for the same time as us. There's also no single metric for progress or success in evolution.

The reason I take this up is that many people who don't  believe in evolution seem to share a misunderstanding that the theory of evolution suggests that Man has evolved *from* chimpanzees, who evolved from some other currently living  ape, and that so it goes, from most complex animal to the simplest one.

Chimps don't have worse fine motor skills than us because they're behind us, they just specialized in other stuff (like ripping the balls of the other animals). > but then again they're lower down the evolutionary scale than we are.

It's a very human-centric view to think that we're more evolved than another animal. Evolution pushes organisms towards being good at living (and reproducing) in whatever environment they happen to find themselves in. Intelligence and fine motor control are certainly useful evolutionary strategies, but really any trait that keeps you from being dead is a valid strategy. There isn't a perfect form that all life is evolving towards. I heard somewhere it had to do with the structure of their muscle fibers? Something like the longer the muscle fibers are the less controll but more power they have? Maybe opposite? Hmm idk looking up apes and monkeys for the rest of the night! Which is why we have the occasional "man on pcp lifts car" story. You sure are  the fuck? http://i.imgur.com/bFu75.gif oh my god it happened >hollocaust

really? Is this an elaborate reference to how nazis used humans in their horrifically unethical experiments? Because if so that's amazing. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Do they help him get to a trauma center? Like with an ambulance and stuff? all bout that k/d baby Born too late to explore the world.

Born too early to explore the Universe.

Born just in time to explore dank memes.   Strange, innit? Lol I found a "demo" at one of the malls and it was like 10 dollars for 10 minutes. Hell no Good for you man, you're right. You have to do something for yourself sometimes. I'm happy you finally have the newest game. I know it feels unbelievable to get a cool new thing when you grow up without much.  Sweet, I have both of those things! I like that I'm not the only one who inferred he was talking about a chimpanzee as a gaming peripheral instead of the Vive.  >3 Apes.  Ah, the ol' reddit peripharoo. Exactly. I've had a rift dev kit 1 and 2 and made a conscious decision to not buy a consumer rift or vive until there are a good amount of triple A games that interest me. That may take a while.  Isn't that how everyone measures their luxury items?  By my count a Vive is about 0.75 RFG. Which isn't all that bad, considering a used older car is about 2.3 RFG. My hypothetical fiance's ring must cost two refrigerators and a dishwasher, because I hypothetically love her and she likes nice things. What I want to know is the cost in blocks of cheese. My last one hour "date" cost 1/4th of a refrigerator. I measure things in Hot N Readies.

Like oh fuck, that Vive costs 160 HNR ...and not a single lentil to be found. Sshhhh! Don't let them know! 2 years* I'm sure they said the same thing once about the nintendo---or the xbox----or just about every successful consumer electronic that is now mainstream.

The "VIVE" likely won't be around forever in it's first gen form (Well, second gen currently) but i'm willing to be it's not going to fade that quickly as a brand. Also, it has propelled VR much further than literally any other consumer-ready product on the market...so I think VR is something you're going to see blow up more and more, so long as big companies continue to stand behind it.
 Honestly I'd rather own a 12 year old car than have to deal with 12 year payments. Saves on insurance and monthly expenses.

Yeah, gotta save up for awhile. But it's very possible. I wish my car payment was that cheap  thats like a whole 12 months of insurance for a stupid 20 year old male

source:am one

edit:who also happens to own a vive...


 I could *swing* that. VR ready computer is around 750$ already nice find! Lol.  Can people just not see that watermark on the video? It's not really a sanctuary, since they do a shitton of breeding, but it functions as a zoo or wildlife park.  One of those bulls gracefully knicked it. That was fucking neat. I feel like actual china shops are a lot more packed than that and generally have roofs which might affect the behavior of the bulls What does this prove, that bulls avoid large obstacles? I would never have guessed.

They should have done it properly and stuck an angry bull in [something like this](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4125/5009722599_329a620f26_b.jpg). Careful, banana people can get nuclear. Speak for yourself.  My buddy Frank is an ape and he calls me beautiful.   > We are hairless apes. 

I guess my back didn't get the memo. people eat apes? FUCK I read that as you would have the same erection. I'd have the same erection Yeah but unless you're a muscle man you couldn't casually pull off a guy's dick. Trust me, it's harder then you'd think.

Edit: lol at downvotes, why would you even bother? Dare I say /r/evenwithcontext !

(should i actually post there?) You can keep fuckin these people if you want. More. Monkey. Pussy. For me! Im hooking up with an orangutan next week. Why would you peel a monkey? This. An unarmed human male fighting for his life is a MONUMENTAL threat. Even with no training, humans can do pretty insane damage with their fists and feet, not to mention biting. Human bites are absolutely nightmarish. Our bite force is among the strongest in the whole animal kingdom, especially when compared to the size of our teeth. We can *easily* eviscerate big chunks of flesh and do permanent damage with a bite.

In hand-to-hand combat, most soldiers are trained to kill with what amounts to a two-strike procedure. One move to get the opponent onto the ground, then another move (be it an elbow, a weapon blow, or a boot to the neck). This can seem exaggerated when you see people training or sparring, but that's only because the adrenaline isn't flowing to its fullest extent. In the real, actual fight-or-else-your-opponenent-WILL-KILL-YOU scenario, an average human male WILL be capable of killing just like that. That's actually really interesting. What were the costumes of?  Sure, but that's still a far cry from the Chimps. Unless you are using your hands, nails, and teeth to rip off his genitals, bite off his fingers, and tear out his eyes and nose you aren't quite as bad. We will punch until we feel safe, they will rip and tear until their opponent stops moving. Retard Strength=10x stronger than average male.

Primate= 10-20x stronger than average male

Retarded Primate= Incredible fucking Hulk I guess you're new here. Welcome to the internet. I used to work retail and I have to respectfully disagree. Sometimes I wonder though... Eh, 50/50 Idk about that. Have you been paying attention to humanity this year? Hey now. Chimps didn't elect Donald Trump. Sweet. I'm gonna go find a chimp that's just under half my size and kick the shit out of it. That should keep them in line for a bit. Have you tried reasoning with some people? WAAAAAAGH!!! I think they look more like Warhammer orcs than Warcraft orcs.  I'd rather have both though. Honestly, I'd say that the bear seems less intimidating without fur. It kind of looks lost and confused. Looks like a kangaroo and an elephant had a baby. Thats no bear son, that's a yaoguai There is a disappointingly small number of pictures of other hairless animals.  I had seen the chimps and bear, really wanted to see a hairless tiger or wolf. Neither do I. I'm just a layman who's thought about this too much. Might be very very wrong. If chimps in a gym makes them smarter, do chimps in a school get fucking jacked?
 You forgot the 3 scoops of mutant whey. Gotta leave chimpmanity behind  Then make them fuck a grapefruit.  Don't forget the gnar pump Human with or without survival training? >Evolution pushes organisms towards being good at living (and reproducing) in whatever environment they happen to find themselves in

So, basically adapt to reproduce and keep the species alive? Well, we could wipe out all chimps, but they could not wipe us out. Does this not mean we have superior survival capabilities? > It's a very human-centric view to think that we're more evolved than another animal.

I know, it's species-ist of me. I fully expect the Social Justice Primates to call me out on Twitter for my hate speech.
 Thank you for subscribing to God facts!!! Hollo, it's me I'm sure they would if they had one.  Not all hospitals have a dispatch.  Also for all we know they might have stopped at an outpatient clinic or an urgent care center.   Thank you. And, it really does. It's also such a great feeling putting in all that hard work, like actually working and making sacrifices, and getting something I'd only dreamed of having, because of that hard work. It's so satisfying. 

On a side note, it's so awesome to have my friends skeptic of the VIVE, and then I'll have them come over to try it for a couple of hours and once they get out, they're always like, "Wow. It's dark outside now? How long-- Oh, 3 hours. Holy shit." it just makes it worth that much more to see something I worked for making people so happy. If you have a friend, or a Windows Store (I know they have them there at least, not sure where else,) then you need to go try the VIVE. Videos don't do it justice, you have to experience it if you can. Hell, I'd be more than happy to let you try mine, on the weird chance you lived/were going to be in Texas! 

Sorry for the wall of text haha. But, thank you for your kind words.  Then what do you feed the apes? I am not sure if we are going to have a lot of triple A games. They tend to cost a lot to develop and the small fraction of consumers who owns/will own a VR headset, not to mention Vive  will not generate enough profit. This is why Facebook buying oculus made so much sense, they are the ones who can benefit the most with casual, social type games which cost very little to make. At most I think what we are going to see is racing games and other stationary games where they can make it for both VR and non VR . For me its the measurement of bananas.
 I personally own 8 refrigerators so far.. >I hypothetically love her

Damn, that's cold. > My hypothetical fiance's ring

Is the fiance hypothetical or is the ring hypothetical? What kind of cheese? Give or take, around 266 blocks of cheese before tax. 800 bucks is basically low end on the high priced refrigerator scale. It's easy to get a fridge for less than 400, though most are "apartment" sized. 

I'm in Japan right now. The AirBnB literally has a fridge the size of my spare beer fridge.  Yup, that's my experience too. Never had a refrigerator last more than 2 It's all a trade off. The 12 year old car will have no warranty and most likely lots of problems. Parts and labor adds up. Sometimes buying new is cheaper. Damn how much is your car payment?! I pay $300 a month and I thought that was high lol.  It's literally in the title of the imgur link you posted... No. No, I could not. I did try though. I think the major part of the experiment was just to show that Bulls aren't careless and won't just walk into the shelves because they're overly massive and have no control over themselves (how we think they are). Yup, I tell every hooker if they can rip my dick off with their bare hands I'd pay them a million dollars. Haven't had to pay any hooker for their services to this day. Some dude should donate their body to medical science and, if he dies when he's still young and healthy with intact genitals, we should hook their cadaver up to a stress-testing machine and find out exactly how much force it takes. Sometimes my roommate will casually show me how far he can pull his... Daquq did I just read? That's all I fuck is chimps and orangutanssssss That's all I fuck just chimps and orangutans. This is so true and nice to see on here. Most men on reddit probably haven't pushed their body to see what they're actually capable of (I really recommend it, that Socrates quote "it is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable" comes to mind).

Human males are capable of being *really* deadly in a number of ways without any weapons. Even in professional MMA fights you occasionally see someone's skull get crushed by a knee by accident. Or look at a typical submission - if they were fighting to the death their opponent would either be dead or have something broken. Well humans are a threat when we have a weapon but unarmed we're not that dangerous to other big mammals really.  There was a story about this MMA fighter who got attacked by a juvenile chimp... This dude could barely keep a baby chimp at bay and he's in the top 1 percent of humans in hand to hand combat.  We are without a doubt the most dangerous and deadly animal on the planet but it is because of our huge brains, creativity, and grasping hands. I hate to be that guy but quick FYI; while I agree with everything you said, eviscerate means to disembowel, the word you're looking for is gouge. While I agree that people have strong bites, I don't think we're capable of disembowelment from a single bite (although that would be a sight to see...) God you made me think of the scene in Saving Private Ryan where the Jewish guy is in hand to hand with the German and he bites his hand and blood comes pouring out. Makes me fucking cringe Uh a chimp could kick a humans ass any day of the week. Humans cant do much when their eyeballs are being eaten. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t1DG-37QhM8 Our bite force is 120 psi, that's nowhere near the strongest, lions are 600, crocodiles are 2,500. This is the secret to the Saiyan's power. As a human being, I have to agree too > It kind of looks lost and confused. 

Me too, thanks.  Which ought to make it more terrifying if it becomes aggressive. Imagine that thing just roaring, its face turning into angry expression, and starts running towards you to mall you to death. elarooooooooooo Be the change you want to see in the world.

Battery powered hair clippers and a ghillie suit aren't all that expensive. Just be good at grappling. I mean im sure they could feed them steroids and shit too. Prejudice aside, it's also an unscientific view. There is no thing as an evolutionary scale or an evolutionary level. Every species is equally as "evolved" as every other one, in that there is no quantifiable metric for evolution at all. It describes a continuous process, not a degree of progress. It's not un PC, it's actually wrong I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet Cmon now, i doubt someone who keeps a chimp as a pet would be so stupid as to not head stright for a trauma center after suffering trauma Vives, duh. i have found the chimpanzee I do the Jack In the Box Taco method.  No, that's for size, not cost. What would a banana cost, 10 dollars?!  Look at the guy with his fancy 8 refrigerators in his lamorghini book shelf.  Colder than a refrigerator  Hypothetically speaking, why would you buy an engagement ring for someone you didn't love? Hypothetically. Like the two refrigerator the ring is worth Cold as the other side of the refrigerator. A fancy cheese So? In Europe $ 300 will get you a A+ brand family-of-6-sized fridge. What the? I've had the same fridge for over 10 years now and the one before that I had for 20 years and it still worked. I only got a newer one because I wanted a bigger size.
 ok, 12 years might be a little much, but a new car is never going to be cheaper than a used car. I've got a 2003 hyundai elentra, no problems so far, and it's been a 12 year old car for like 2 years! That's silly and depends on brand.  12 year old Jeep?  Maybe.  I have two 28 year old Toyotas and a 29 year old schoolbus and the cost breaks down as follows.

88 Pickup purchased in 2012 $1200, Over the past 4 years I've probably put about 800 into misc maintenance (new tires, oil change, etc.)  

88 Corolla purchased last year for $1,000 I have yet to put any money into this aside from title transfers.  

Both have been driven daily for the past year by my wife and I.  Both combine cost about $3,000 including all parts and maintenance.  

My schoolbus is a different story, that has cost about $6,000 total so far.

Regardless for $9k over 4 years I have 3 vehicles, a pickup, economy car and a schoolbus.  I believe that is about half the cost of a lower end new car.    
 Neighbour of mine paid about $750 per month on his (at the time) brand new G37. Including insurance he paid around a grand a month  And you got an inch or two extra now too bro.  Well then you'd still have _2Million left.  That's called wanking, mate https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=P21-iJk4qQc Here you go. This is exactly the type of stuff I was thinking about, when I was restraining myself from typing a giant wall of text. XD 

I think another prime example is to be found in the known activities of WW2 era spec-ops servicemen. Guys in the commandos/SAS/OSS/non-crappy-resistance-units were capable of killing sentries with terrifying speed and efficiency. It's the single most realistic thing about any war movie, as long as they don't go in for that weird two-hands-on-the-head-neck-snap move that I don't think is a real thing anywhere.

Prison fights are another instance where we can see how quickly a male human can kill another male human. In a high-security prison, you'll have mere seconds before people are on you, tazing you or shooting you or clubbing you...and yet prison murders are not at all uncommon. Fuck yeah. This is why I love going to the gym in short fuckin shorts, loading up 450, and squatting to depth until my nugs pop out. I scream and stare at my veiny quads as I arise from my 3 feet below parallel squat and bust a nut all over the mirror  For real. For 99% of us, our mind is the greatest limiter, only allowing us paltry displays of our awesome power. For people who learn to work through the mental blocks, their body is capable of unbelievable strengths.

After listening to a Navy Seal describe how our mind constantly prevents us from achieving, I've begun working through my own mental blocks while working out and it's a truly awesome display of power. My mantra becomes, "My body will fail before my mind does". You can keep going until your body breaks down, so you have to be really in tune with yourself as to avoid injury. Did you just.... Agree to disagree?

*Puts on sunglasses while won't get fooled again plays* TIL a bare bear kind of looks lost and confused. My mom tried to mall me to death when I was a kid. We were there for hours. I survived though so it can't be that bad. True. With gear they'd definitly get bigger, no doubt. Well considering we are able to debate these things with people across the planet instantaneously using electrical signals, and chimps are kept in cages and throw shit at each other, I think we are a bit higher up on the scale (if there was one). 1) He was at a wildlife refuge when he was attacked. 

2) He no longer owned the chimp. 

3) It wasn't his previously owned chimp that attacked him.  Yeah, but how does one acquire it? Hypothetically, is that chimpanzee going to eat your hypothetical fiancée's face? Chimpancheez Maybe not quite but do Americans have normal fridges or freezers like most do in the UK or do you all go for ice making, water dispensing, juice pumping fully plumbed beasts like we see on the sitcoms? i looked it up. 250 for a A++. If you want a fancy one with A+++ you pay up to 500. Of course there are more expensive ones, but that is true fore everything. I've had 4 rental properties, moved out of 3 because a new fridge broke within 2 years, landlord refused to replace for 2 properties, my current lease they replaced it without a problem. Manufacturer's often build to the lowest level they can to ensure it barely makes the warranty period, and rely on people not keeping the paperwork to claim a replacement. Stores sell warranties relying on people not to be aware they already have one and they're entitled to it anyway. My fridge went out recently and I replaced it. The repairman I talked to said that they're lasting about 10 years a piece now. He wasn't wrong the fridge he was replacing was 11 years old and then my sisters went out recently and was 9 years old.  Sometimes. Sometimes not. Pretty good read on it here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/25a0if/article_of_the_week_the_market_for_lemons_akerlof/
Though modern efforts to track problematic cars are changing this with things like CarFax and such. That's false. My old Chevy that I bought to save money has cost me more than my new Acura would've cost me in one year.  I have a 16year old that I anticipate is going to last me 5 more years. just have to take care of it and change the oil and not neglect maintenance :D 2000 Acura with 150k miles on it. I think I'm going to get tired of it and want something nicer before it actually dies on me Lol, 12 years is too old? Jeez. We still driving Jap imports from the late 80s down here in Kiwiland! Damn.. I'd never have a payment like that. I always had something to trade in plus I'd save up a down payment to bring it down quite a bit.  Yep, it's now 3 inches long. Thanks for the reference! I think realizing just how easy it is, physically, to take a life is important too.  If you're in New York walking down a crowded street any person who felt like it could shank you, end your life right there without so much as an explanation.  

That little old lady down the street? She could pull out a revolver and cap your ass tomorrow.

That old man you gave the finger for driving 20 in a 30? He could swerve over and put you in the wall.

The little girl next door could set your house on fire while you sleep.

That sort of power really shows you the fragility of life and the futility of paranoia Depends on what you clsssify as neck snap. If it's the old "tiny twitch and dead" then yeah, it's unrealistic. If, however, it's a proper twist diagonally up and back, then it's definitely a thing. Where do you get your drugs from because I want some of that shit.  I like the part where you busted a nut OINK.  We're smarter, yes, but we're both equally evolved. Phrasing the question in terms of the degree of evolution is a misstatement. Sell your refrigerator Be a person that can afford a Vive.  FULL CIRCLE :D One does not simply...

 aquire a chimpanzee  No, only her ring  Literally. Those are normal fridges here. Do y'all just have a box with ice in it? Yeah my fridge was 2k and that was an open box special how? Thought you were describing your kid for a second there.... In America, all you need to do to buy expensive shit is to plunge yourself into debt and have someone tell you that you totally should. And 1/4 inch around. Well that's why, they can't get a good grip on it.  No problem! People don't realize that anyone with a knife can kill you. Like anyone. it takes barely any force to break human skin and even children can push with enough force to sink a sharp knife into your stomach, thigh, neck. Without medical attention these places are death sentences. I fuckin love all y'all that's what i have with just trays, no ice maker.

am american Probably repairs. Depending on how old the Chevy was, fuel costs could be significant as well. I had a similar situation with my old truck, it kept breaking and the monthly cost of my payment, fuel, maintenance, and credit card bills (for the repairs) cost more than my new truck's monthly payments. My new truck's warranty has all maintenance covered, so effectively my only bills are fuel and car payment, which are still about 200 a month less than the total I spent on the old truck. If only he knew you were trying to snipe with a pistol  This happens so much the times I do go medic it's annoying.

Pro tip to medics - use the club melee weapon (iirc) to break wood and wired fence for these situations! It also looks like your bludgeoning your teammate to death on his screen. Bonus points! That escalated quickly. First he tries to heal the box, then he obliterates it. DON'T YOU DIE ON ME DAMNIT Hacksaw Ridge (2016) "Dear god, help me get one more." You mean, the only medic in Battlefield 1                                                                                                                         
                                                  

edit: they revive you as much as the support guys are giving you munition "Don't die on my you son of a bitch, fucking god damn boxes move out of the cocksucking way!" I guess you can say....

the game had bad hitboxes. [Credit for this gif goes to /u/Mister_Heated over at /r/Battlefield_One](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/5bd1rz/the_most_dedicated_medic_ever/) the youtube controls trigger me so much I've died so many times trying to save some one who would rather respawn ASAP.  I like how you screen-recorded a YouTube video rather than just copying the URL and pasting it into Gfycat. Desmond Doss??? Pretty sure Hacksaw Ridge was inspired by this guy [Survive!] (https://media.giphy.com/media/6PfMYkTXxpG2Q/giphy.gif) Hacksaw Ridge looks really good. I got this game so i can finally partake in these memes.  LIVE INSECT!!  "You know, Steve, you could have just pushed it a little to the side."

"THERE WAS NO TIME!!!" I don't get it. Can someone's explain? Shout out to all the supporters who care just a little too much! *support class for life* After all that and the dude doesn't even get a "Thank you"... I would fucking blow you up to save your life!

I love you, man!

I love you too, man! i didn't know Desmond Doss played battlefield In BF3, all I did was run around as a medic. I love that class I want that guy on my team. I swear that 80% of the people who play medics have no idea what they are doing.  And the revived guy did not thank the medic... cruel world Not all heroes wear capes  I can't even get a text back. If you didn't mention that it's a cross post from battlefield, people won't know which game it is from. Why doesn't /r/gaming require the name of the game I don't understand. It's frustrating.  Yeah but when I'm dead and there's a medic 1 m away I never get revived -_- Diagnosis:  The patient was cynical.  Pupils were fixed and dilapidated.  Presenting with acute level 2 deadishness.  

Recommendation:  Two rear administered chest compression belly flops followed by a radical 6.5mm boxectomy.    This. This is the calling of all TRUE medics. Us dedicated few will keep you alive and well. As I said in the battlefield 1 Reddit, PS4 medics don't know how to play this class. Follow this man  god damnit man, the only medics in my games (other than my friends) will literally STAND ON MY DEAD BODY for 5+ seconds shooting at things on a point, instead of reviving me so that I can help. A good medic is hard to find I got the game this morning. I'm happy with the purchase. Video source? I usually have the exact opposite experience. I have a clip where the medic runs right by me. Goes prone, and slowing back crawls over me.... I lost my faith in humanity that day  I've done that before, I think it's a glitch with hitboxes.  Would you say he's..... medic-cated? I'm that Medoc Nothing like the times we had in Karkand in Bf2 for PC before all the crappy expansions came out... You void easily dominate the round in points just bringing people back with the defibrillator and tossing medkits. :p

And the were a couple guys who were just masters, and knew when to quit reviving because a sniper has a dead lock on your corpse. And the others who were just dicks. He clearly forgot the first rule of the Hipo-crate-ic oath is: I shall do no harm (to a crate). Somebody just watched Hacksaw Ridge. I didn't choose the medic life, the medic life chose me. Now let me get my revive!  I had one crawl under a tank one time to pick me up lol You can actually see the desperation in his characters movements.  I don't even think I have the determination to save someone like that in real life Damn, he really wants those points DONT YOU DIE ON ME! Haha that was me, I couldn't believe it actually worked Damn you box!   Damn you straight to he- hey!  There's a guy here!   Up you go,  on your feet!  7/10 not enough kamikaze medic This almost makes up for alllllll the medics that don't revive a few meters from you.   Me dic in a box I thought, when the beta came out, there were complaints that each class character was the same for each of the four classes out of the entire team (e.g. The Indian fighter for Medics when playing as the Brits). I thought EA said that these were just characters they chose for the beta, and upon actual release there will be a more diverse range of characters in each class? BREATHE DAMN IT BREATHE!  Lmao what a box Where is this guy/girl when I need them lol.  All I get is 5 medics nearby and....nope, no revive.  Meanwhile, when I die, I have 3 medics within 20 meters who seem to make an effort to avoid me.  Wow OP. Not even a thankful teabag? Meanwhile 3 medics sitting right next to my dead body won't even look at me :)))) First time seeing a medic doing his job in BF1 PrevWon..............battlefield 2142, go fuck yourself best medic ever
 All that work and dude didn't even thank him Wow, didn't even say thanks. What an absolute legend Jason Statham is The Medic.

Coming soon to a theater near you. I really enjoy playing medic for a change tbh. Nothing I hate more than dying and seeing 3 medics just run past me while waiting for a res.  If I was that medic, that guy would have force respawned, died in that same spot and force respawned again before I even got the third revive attempt off. Gave up playing the medic class as everyone just skips their revive period. With the world so set on tearing itself apart, doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me to want to put a little bit of it back together. *in Australian accent*
"Oh that, that's just Barney. He's fucking legend, the cunt." Thought this was me for a second, but I didn't get sniped at the end. This is why I love video games. Not because of the tech. Because humans play them.  This bug exists since bf3 *slowclap* . Well, fixing things is probably overrated. At least the box was destroyable. This is true teamwork at it's finest! I hate it when a medic will just walk over my body Please God. Help me save one more "must revived this guy! damn boxes!
live man!" YOU ARE GREAT DOCTOR Guaranteed he was doing it for the oder of hippocrates medal DX My friend who plays medic loves to shit on my ratio with bad rezzes This is amazing There's a big difference between a medic and a practicer of the satanic arts that can revive you. I think he just really didn't like that box. I want to be like him when I grow up.  Hacksaw ridge?  Killed by Udontlovemeh. Healed by Yeahheloveyehlots.  Andrew Garfield is clearly dedicated to this role  Not even a thank you? This is badass. It looks more like some kind of game exploit :/ That must be the only medic in the game that actually does his job.  This needs captions!  /u/Quanto21 its not like he would stand to lose his real life.... and yet he risked himself.... utter heroics .... bravo.... bravo.... This must be where the plot from hacksaw ridge came from. "A true story." I thought this was scene from Hacksaw Ridge until he pulled his gun out.  I kept clicking to make the gif Fullscreen because of the YouTube bar. BibleThump  Give him a medal That was me in bf4, whenever i had medic i would actually be a medic and that would be my main goal among others Desmond Doss, is that you? That's a nice YouTube overlay at the start. Please everyone take a lesson from this saint and practice what he preaches. Bless this player.  This new Mel Gibson movie looks intense! We need more of his caliber.  That medic deserves a "Medal of Honor!"
*Wink wink nudge nudge* So many  times I've stood by a medic, begin to get healed... Nothing.
So many times I've died by a medic... No ress.

So many times I've run out of ammo and asked a support for ammo. Nothing.

The worst time was when I did extremely well for our team with Sentry. Ran out of ammo. Ran to our only support in the team.. No ammo. A true team player.  Get that soldier in my squad god dammit!  Darn, hit boxes! I wish I had this game... :( Good on ya So, I've seen a lot of BF1 posts lately...is the game really that good? Bullet-dodging, box-killing medic... you da real MVP. :') That's some Desmond Doss shit right there Wait is it a hitbox issue?? I've been playing since launch and I just assumed my syringe was fucked up. I stab the body a few times and if the fucker doesn't get up, I just bounce. Where do you have to aim to revive??  Video? WHERE WAS THIS GUY WHEN I WAS PLAYING LAST NIGHT?!?!? 😑😑 What a bro  This restored my faith in humanity I've been this drunk...However he pulled it off. OP is the real MVM. Most Valued Medic.
 I'm imagining on a movie the medic would keep putting the syringue while crying "WAKE UP" and then gets shotting and put the syringue one last time, everyone gets happy. Take notes everyone. That's how you Battlefield. He was probably going for the medal with squad revives. I remember when I was doing this medal, I prioritized green skulls over everything else. "NOT ON MY WATCH! BREATHE GOD DAMNIT!" OP, you can copy the YouTube link into Gfycat and go from there, man. This medic is high on his own stash Not all heros wear capes  WHY WON'T YOU UN-DIE!!?  A true hero.  When one of the three stooges gets mad.  This is me all the time. Trying to heal someone stuck in the wall "GOD... DAMN... BOXES!!! I'm trying to save a life here!!!" /r/Battlefield_One *give him an expensive coffin for his dead body* "Medic" more like necromancers HERESAMEDKITPATCHYOURSELFUP
 How come sometimes I see bodies and I can't revive them at all even though the icon is above their heads. There is nothing blocking the syringe in the cases i'm talking about.
 OP TRIPLE dipped! What a great guy You didn't even say thank you after all that? Medic of the year!!! HELP ME LORD GET ONE MORE, JUST ONE MORE

I just left seeing Hacksaw Ridge. Anti-semitic Gibson be damned, it was a good flic.
 [OP is a goat fucker.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/370uvj/found_this_as_a_review_on_tera/crivk2e/) What gun is the medic using? Woh! That was fucking awesome! Props to that dude! I wish people healed others more I'm so tired of just waiting and seeing a medic beside my dead body and not caring. Back in the grave you go! You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Well the Trench gun automatic he had is shit at range. The pistol has a far better chance at that range. Does BF1 have a hardcore mode like CoD4? I found sniping with a pistol pretty easy when it only takes 1 hit to kill a dude. Nah. You're just using the club to do chest compressions.  Club doesn't break wire but other than that good idea Hatchet Never had a problem with obstacles while playing medic. 

However if someone is blown up I feel like the ragdoll sometimes messes up. I don't know if it's fully client sided but sometimes my mates in TeamSpeak are like "I'm right there by the window." and for me they are somewhere else. I then tried running to where the corpse shows up for me and was not able to revive my teammate :( He killed the box to revive it, but this dumb soldier took the revive instead. I'm sad because this only happens rarely. We live in a narcissistic world.

Edit: I bought BF1 today and after all that discussion I'm trying to be the best  dedicated medic this game has ever seen. 

I'm still sad because I rarely see other medic  in this game. Every squad should have one at the least. 

 "Ze healing is not as rewarding as ze demolition." -Demomedic He is the real MVP Anyone else hear the revive sound when it happened in the gif? GET THE FUCK UP DON'T YOU HOLD TO SKIP ON ME DAMMIT I WILL REACH INTO HEAVEN AND YANK YOUR SCREAMING SOUL BACK! HEEBIES DROPPING! CAN YOU WALK?!

THEN FUCKING WALK! Please god, let me get one more.  Just saw it yesterday. It was pretty great. Since it's a true story they had videos of some of the real people at the end talking about the events. I won't tell you who cause spoilers. One of the best movies I've ever seen In my experience the medics in BF1 do a LOT more revives compared to BF4.   I think this is due to players grouping up a lot more compared More like OP is one of those ultra rare players who actually waits for a revive post death. Nothing pisses me off more during rush/operations than players of the attacking team spamming Skip the second they're down. I've only played around 5 hours but from my experience medics are abundant. I only ever play medic in games but I had to play support a couple times cause there was too many medics. I only play medic In bf1 medics have some of the most op guns in the game I love playing medic but I cannot fucking stand the impatient people who deploy asap, even when I'm running through a barrage of fire to revive them.   I stopped reviving because almost every one skips the revive almost immediately Yeah, nah, the problem is people skip revives too rapidly.  I've been standing on someone with my needle out and they still skip.  

Don't get me wrong, I've had a lot of medics not revive me when it's completely safe to do so as well, but it goes both ways. There's actually shitloads. A shocking amount. Way more than 4 Well that took a wrong turn.  http://i.imgur.com/l2RGEgm.gifv Sounds like he had to do a Box Bypass Operation. YEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH /r/hitboxgore ...but why? Why? I can't say that. Not since the accident.  Game name and source? You're a good person OP. If half the OPs on /r/gaming did this... You're really maximizing your karma profit from this post, aren't you? You da real MVP ;) I'm internally oppressed by it It's like I'm back in college! I had 187 revives in my last round. Medic is the best class for me, but I hate it when they just quit! Remind them that you there. Ask them nicely to wait. 

My team won five rounds in a row because the began to wait for me. Suddenly there were more medics. At least two per squad. The enemy was overrun!! You know the flashing revive indicator means they are trying to skip right? Just don't go to help those ones. Well he didnt carry a weapon. But yes. The guy in the clip died. This god of a medic comes around from the great medical abyss to save his life, dodging bullets and artillery fire, to save his unfortunate soul. 

Unfortunately, Dice's bad hitboxes, actual boxes, and server-side lag tried to get in his way, but he said 'fuck boxes'. He shot through the wooden menace to finally rescue his fellow soldier from a cold and lonesome death. Nahh they do they just don't give af about reviving  It's not just PS4.  Only ever get revived by my friends on Xbox one.  "Blueberries" as we like to call them will stand on your corpse and not revive.  Funny I play medic class and put in the effort to revive my squad (random squads not friends) then get told to fuck off with the revives. Makes me want to stand on their dead body's and Tbag the shit out of them. (Or revive them out of spite)  I have the same problem with girls... The only reason I would want him to return from the land of the dead....is so I can send him back MYSELF!

Edit: TIL that you can say a quote from two possible sources and watch people go nuts. I think I found a new hobby.

Edit 2: I had both PotC and RvB in mind. Tho I think the RvB line is slightly different. Anyone know the episode #? http://i.imgur.com/aIaFk.gif Queue the gif of people pushing the dude back under the burning car. Here I go dying again! But only 99.9999% of the shots you take from a mile away with a pistol.  Not yet, but they should be releasing HC soon. Sniping with shotgun slugs is also fun It's just a stylish precordial thump. The least dedicated soldier you'll find. I cant tell if its sarcasm are you talking about in game? because the biggest complaint my friends and i have is that everyone wants to play this like COD and respawns instantly instead of waiting for a revive

meanwhile my dumbass dies because i ran into fire for you. Like its crazy just wait 10 seconds We live in a [chaotic world](http://scrolldownandread.blogspot.com/2016/05/on-chaos-order-and-randomness.html) which aspires for unachievable order. I hate when people don't play their class. As an avid player of the BF series, Project Reality, and the Arma series I'm always the squad medic because I take that shit seriously. My buddies always just leave that spot open for me because they know I'll be on top of it.  I was revived 0 times in the beta. And I played it a LOT.  In a narcissistic what?.....

FINISH THE DAMN . Shrodinger says it happens all the time...and never HEY - YOU - GET ON YOUR FEET!  [DID SOMEONE SAY GET THE FUCK UP!?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi5XrfOJ-MQ) [come on...you gotta get up :(](https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/simba-mufasa-the-lion-king-25952837-800-400.jpg) DONACDUM!

Please god, let me get... let me... let........ LET ME GET ONE MORE, GODDAMMIT! The real story is even more intense. They cut out several more days fighting. Also, he wasn't wounded and removed immediately as depicted, instead he was alone for 5 hours tending himself. Then after being found, crawled off his stretcher so someone else could be evacuated first.

Then, while waiting for evac he was hit by a sniper and his arm suffered a compound fracture. He then fashioned a splint from a nearby rifle and crawled 300 yards to the aid station. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Doss#Medal_of_Honor_citation

I'm guessing they probably cut this all out, much like Col. Claus von Stauffenberg's history in Valkyrie, because nobody would believe one man did it.   Just watched the movie tonight. Figuratively blew me away.  What movie? As a medic my KDR is usually less than ideal because I spend so much time running around reviving. The medal challenges help too. Oh medic medal gotta res 20 people? Suddenly the whole server is just running around reviving. Hilarious Yeah, I wonder if the change in focus has helped a bit. How many BF1 people are actually gamers who came back to BF series or are first entering it because of the return to historical gameplay? I know that I have a group of friends who all jumped into the beta because we loved the idea of a WWI shooter, even if it is a bit anachronistic. The first thing two of my friends said was, "I want to be a medic." They didn't get a lot of kills, but they loved helping out the team.

Maybe new people are bringing in a fresh team-based perspective to the series. I recently had the worst medic in the world on my team. Ran right over my dead body, with absolutely nothing happening around me. That happened a ton of times.

Later, he made up for it though. He and I were in the same squad with another medic, and we just went as a group, healing each other after being killed. Racked up so many kills. i have hundreds of hours on locker - that is absolutely not true. locker if youre in a decent squad you get a revive train going, good fucking luck getting more than 3 revives in bf1 though... Is it also because there seems to be more "on foot" combat? 
  
At least that was my impression from the beta. I feel like in BF4 by the time everyone jumped in a truck, car, tank, helicopter or plane, there were 4-5 guys on foot. 

Only got BF1 last night so haven't had a chance to see what it's like live.  In BF4 I exclusively ran around with the defibs reviving teammates, fixed vehicles when I could too On the flip side when the little "medic radar" thing tells you there's 3 or 4 medics within 10m but then you watch as they all go to 20m and disappear with no revive :(  > More like OP is one of those ultra rare players who actually waits for a revive post death. Nothing pisses me off more during rush/operations than players of the attacking team spamming Skip the second they're down.

I do this sometimes. In all honesty, it's because I walked into an ambush, and no that you'll end up dead too. Can't tell you how many times I was on top of the list even with a negative KD and 20 kills less than second place. People don't understand the power of assists points. They have no idea. Bf1 medics are literally bf4 assault and medic crushed into one. Their weapons are for all intent and purpose assault rifles, they have access to grenade launchers, medkits, revives etc. They are the most flexible combat class, but people still endlessly moan that every medic isn't since charging around to Rez idiots. The "dae medics are all shit" circle jerk is so strong on bf one subreddit. I mean, they have the Mondragon Storm (most of the Storm weapons are OP tho) but what else? Medics also have the ability to heal themselves quickly and easily. Main reason I will never stick with another class. If you're playing alone To Albuquerque? *triple points* Dude..... i just realized you commented on yourself and it all made sense in the end. Goddamn you, OP! Why are you replying to your own comment?! 

Okay everyone, let's show OP what's what around here by......by.....upvoting everything he posts? Clever Bastard! Did you gild yourself too!? what's this from? Make a thread, comment on your thread, then reply to your comment. 

WHAT A MADMAN! I fucking despise double chip dippers. You've been sitting in traffic on your way back from work today just thinking about how to get to the top of the sub today, huh... Well you did it. You did it well. Youre a mad man.... dont change ever  Fucking hilarious ^ First part of getting better is admitting you have a problem... I thought the joke was going to be he was walking through the table like a ghost I... I don't think you're allowed to do this.  Holy fuck I didn't realize OP replied to OP's reply to OP

DRAINTHESWAMP Goddamn OP you're killing it Game name is in the title.

Edit: I guess I'm downvoted for helping the person that asked.  
Edit2: Oh well. You don't get 2 million karma from moseying around  [deleted] Needs the cursor in the middle 187 revives in one round? 

SarcasticOkay.gif How did shooting the boxes revive his teammate? So what game is this? Is it not common for medics to heal people in this game? Or healing you. I've followed dudes around for ages trying to get their attention and they will just fucking stare at you, wondering why your meleeing them. Wish they would just let you take a health pack from a medic like you could in hardline. I don't run through mustard gas and artillery fire to save lives, only to come home and hear this shit. **GODDAMMIT** some of us care LOL really? jesus man, sounds like playing support in dota/league. Damned if you do, damned if you dont. Calm down there Sarge. iunderstoodthatreference.gif Where have I heard that before? "MORE STEAM!" [Here ya go](http://i.imgur.com/NUqY0G3.gif). cue https://imgur.com/r/whitepeoplegifs/SF8MzIP That's my issue! Every damn time I try to heal someone, people "rage spawn" and refuse to be revived. Obviously you don't want to be revived every time. But the amount of time people instantly respawn can be so frustrating. There is nothing worse then running to a body, only to have the person respawn. Completely leaving you with your pants around your knees. 

That said, I also play plenty of games where medics are healing / reviving, and people aren't insta respawning. So it hasn't been as bad as some have said. 

But people rage spawning is def a thing. I've seen that more then Medics refusing to revive or heal. And honestly, due to the kind of limited weapons in this game, it doesn't make sense why someone would pick the Medic class just for the weapon. There are much better weapons in the other classes. I love healing + I'm damn good with the weapons we get. But if I wasn't healing, then I wouldn't be sticking around for the Medic guns alone. So I can't imagine most people picking medic class are doing so purely for weapons.

**Edit:**

To be fair, there are bad medics. One of the worst, is the type that revives just for the points. They don't access the situation and determine whether a revive even makes sense. So they dive in, blindly revive you - only for you to get instantly re-killed.

Or there are medics that lack complete map-awareness, and seem to ignore everyone that needs a revive. So I actually get why some people might have had a bad experience, and said fuck it - I'll just spawn when I want.

My advice is, access your team every match. Within the first 3 min of every match, don't respawn instantly. Wait. And if no medic revives you, or you get shitty revives - then you can start insta-respawning. But at least wait and see. There are a lot of medics that just want to do their jobs. And it's really disheartening when everyone rage spawns and instantly dies out. Well. I don't always want a revive. Fully aware its a ticket lost. Sometimes want to use a different gun, change class, check to see if theres a vehicle I can use, try and take a different objective. 

Sometimes I skip the revive because I know more than the medic does. Die and think wow I should have never have approached from  that way, or seeing a group of 3-4 people when I see the kill cam and know I'll just die again and take out the medic with me. 

The blinking skull is easily a big "get the fuck out of here, this is a terrible spot" symbol. Depends on the medic though. When I play for a few minutes and theres a medic in my squad whose laying down smoke before revives, or waits till its clear. Then I'll wait everytime for the revive. 

The syringe is a tool, theres times when its not the best idea to use it. Throw down medic crates all day erryday though. When its down to 10-15 tickets and you gotta a medic going HAM with the syringe on an objective you have, and the map is clearly showing 3/4 of your team fighting for the other objective. The medic should be moving towards there. Not trying to grind points on an objective that is likely safe.  If you got shot maybe it wasn't a good idea to revive me just so I get shot too. Wish I could give you more than 1 up vote. Sadly it's true! I have died more times trying to revive some one that has raged respawned.  I really prefer the old system where they force you to wait at least until you can spawn again. 

Then again I do understand people wanting to use that time to customise load out or something.  Jesus Christ it's the worst. I love being a medic and reviving my teammates n shit but when there are people 3m away from me who don't wait 5 seconds in an area where there are no enemies and under full cover... WHY We need more acts of "randomness" in bf1. Btw nice read. [deleted] Guys. The thermal drill. Go get it Thought you were gonna link Pharoahe Monch's "Simon Says". [Bringing back the dead](https://youtu.be/EP4xdHryM7U?t=126) YOU! Get back to the fight! 

Dallas has always had more of a leadership personality. Ah yes, my alarm clock. We all came here to have a good time.

How dare you.  If only Simba was a medic Fuck you m8.  My second favorite Disney parent death scene well that took a dark turn real fast No. Get out. Take my upvote and fuck off.[](/wellfuck) Weeee are nacho kind of peeeople.  He can't swear, remember?  5/7 needs more accuracy I have never seen a movie like this before it truly is next level Same thing!  Just a couple hours ago. Hacksaw Ridge with Andrew Garfield. Try killing the dude that killed your dude first THEN worry about your dude, or the dude might just kill your dude again more or worse- you as well, dude.

Trust me I'm a professional. Yeah, that is what the medic does. It is a support class, meaning you support the people who are killing. Your KD means nothing if your team still loses. I main as a medic in Dirty Bomb. If you have a positive K/D as a medic, either your team sucks or you're doing it wrong. Revives are so fast and medics are so squishy that it's almost always better to revive first and let the assault class defend you. It helps that you can charge your defibs (or for my character, the health rail gun) before doing a long or wall jump out from behind cover and landing on the downed player. Two of the medics, mine included, are the fastest characters, which makes that statagy more legit.  Yeah anecdotal experience may vary. I for one have a guy who always goes medic in my group and never does anything. I think I've seen him use a syringe maybe once, but most of the time he gets lost in the action and we do the objectives without him. Not that I'm complaining, I'd rather have him around than not, but you never know what motivates somebody to go medic because sometimes they're not the best. 

It doesn't really effect me though since I play an assassin droid and the engineer repairs me.  This is my first Battlefield game. I was really bad at the last few battlefields so I never really put much time into them. This is the first one ive actually got a lot of hours into and I also started with and mostly play the medic class. Love helping the team out because im not sure how to advance and didn't know the maps. Lately ive been playing with the assault class because I think im getting the hang of stuff. Feeling more comfortable about maps and how things work. Got about 50hrs in the game I bet he didn't have syringes equipped. That'd be a close second on things that drive me up the wall, yup!
I had one shoot from 20m to 0, but turns out he was just bayonet charging across my corpse to get mowed down on the other side of the wall... Or you have them stand like 10m away for 30 seconds and then they die.

Like great fucking job, you didnt do anything helpful the entire time you were near me. BF4 Assault *is* the medic. All the classes are basically the same in BF1! I'd say they get DMRs in a game where medium range isn't well supported (Snipers obviously do medium and long, but support and assault are better close), which makes them good. >Bf1 medics are literally ***bf4 assault and medic crushed into one***

This doesn't even make sense... 

There wasn't an Assault class and a Medic class in BF4. The Assault class **was** the medic. The BF1 Medic is functionally identical to the Assault class from BF4. 

>Their weapons are for all intent and purpose assault rifles, they have access to grenade launchers, medkits, revives

You literally just described the Assault class from BF4. 

They didn't crush two classes into one to make the BF1 Medic. They just renamed Assault to Medic. 

>They are the most flexible combat class, but people still endlessly moan that every medic isn't since charging around to Rez idiots

No, what people get annoyed by is seeing people who are playing medic class and completely ignoring the fact that they have the ability to res people.

 Like the countless times when I get killed by an enemy, a friendly medic kills the guy who killed me, then literally runs right past my corpse, comes within 2 feet, and then sprints away without helping. Like, why the everloving fuck would you not take the 2 seconds to help your ally. That's whats annoying. You don't have to go out of your way to rez people, but at least do it when you can.

You may be playing Medic for the weapons, but at least be a team player when you get the opportunity.  Umm, the assault class in BF4 was the medic. I'm waiting for the renderzooks of biplanes where the medic then dives out heals his teammate mid air and the patient renters the plane to fly it suicide bomber into the objective. All their guns are good for all ranges Something sweeper, forget the first part  It's okay because I have him tagged as goat fucker OP has 2.3 million comment karma, he knows what he's doing! triple dippin Seriously op is the kind of dude that would do this AND gold himself from another account. Im on to you op Holy shit! He mustve been planning for years... Bastard http://www.trendengel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Seinfeld.jpg [The clip from Seinfeld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLOyChP2AWA) big blong theories He's not asking for the source he's saying it like he can't believe it 

Like:  "Wow you actually bought a turtle?" Yes..... Jesus Joseph and doggy style Mary he does have 2 mil karma. What the hell op how did you do that Me too It's not common for a medic to go to such lengths to save someone in games, that's for sure. You can request health and it will put an icon above your head. Sometimes as a medic it's hard to spot that somebody is at low health with the new circular health bar. It was easier in BF4 imo Well you sir are a rare breed.  Most of your brethren don't understand the point of the medic class.  When I play medic I get minimum 10 revives a game.  MINIMUM.  But I hate the weapons on medic in this game so I don't play as one much anymore.  You just got sarged is that not pirates of the Caribbean? .grif? Red vs blue > cue

I appreciate the correction.   Still figuring this game out, do you have to hit a button to "ask" for a revive or can they see that you're dead? The number of times people have skipped with me literally standing over their corpse with my needle out is stupid high.  Uh, a ton of people play medic for their guns. You think their guns are bad, try Support where your LMGs shoot pebbles and you are sniper bait or Assault where you are completely useless until you are 20 feet away on a huge open map and your class role is to suicide into tanks. I usually wait to deploy but I run into a lot of "assault medics" or "sniper medics" who do nothing when they are 2 feet away. Literally I will have like 5 medics within 5-10m of to me not reviving I don't know, I love the semiautomatic rifles. You soundn like the guy who just gets in a plane and takes off If it's down to 10-15 tickets, a few more guys who waited for a revive earlier in the match would've won it.....

Every game I've seen lost by 10 or less was absolutely lost because more guys didn't wait for the medic. :) ON THE GODDAMN GROUND! I knew one day I'd see Payday memes on the front page [Me too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Fy5w2klbg) Brillz remix or the original tho?!  Dank, quality meme. Ed...ward? Right in the feels.  who would deserve the golden medal then? i'm curious and then the person skips revive because i didn't revive them right away. Yeah, I always try to do that. But a lot of the time it's a sniper or something. I remember way back in Battlefield 2 where there was a teammate who got sniped next to a barrier. I went prone next to the barrier to revive him and he got sniped again. This went on for 4-5 times and I racked up a lot of points in revives. Felt bad for the guy but i wanted those points dammit! I switch back on this and reviving right away depending on the team. Meaning even though they see I'm a medic 3m away if I don't instantly revive them the fucks will hold the skip too fast for me to do anything.  And then while you do that they skip the revive  Yep. Assault became medic and engineer became assault for the most part  My mistake. Bf3 and 4 never did it for me compared to bc2 and the others so I never played them much. [deleted] Why's that? For uh, science.  I too have him tagged as goat fucker. i also have him tagged as goat fucker, but i honestly dont know why i do how do you tag people?
 Tagged as goat fucker tagger Yeah same but I can't remember why nothing wrong with being the greatest of all time fucker imo Is OP using a new account?  I distinctly remember having a ronaldoooooo tagged as a goat fucker. He tripple dipped the chip.  thanks thanks liar Lmao, what an interesting example. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNry4PE93Y Isn't the internet an awesome place? Ronny99 is Reddit elite, distant cousin of fellow karma collectors like pepsi and gallowboob, everybody knows that Catzz. thanks I should play this game. I loved being a healer in World of Warcraft. I think that's why  the game should enable mics for shit just like this  How do you like them apples?! And by apples I mean bullets! exactly what i thought, no one else seems to get it. As /u/DeathsIntent96 states it can also be quoting RvB. Both work in  the situation though XD It's griff with 2 fs the 2nd f is very important. what? I thought so too but I put the quote into google and all I got was pirates of the caribbean. Then I put it into the RVB wiki and I got no results.

So I'm not sure. What episode was it from? Medics automatically see that someone can be revived. It's like a skull icon that hovers over your dead body. It has a circle around it, that lets the medic know how much time left they have before reviving can't be done.

If you are in a squad, the skull is green. Everyone else is Blue. So you shouldn't need to tell a medic that you need a revive. If we see the skull icon and it's there for more then 3 seconds, we are thinking: either they are waiting for a revive, or they aren't paying attention. Either way, if a Medic is half way decent, they will go for it.

You see, revives are like crack for us that actually play the class for the class. You want the revive for points, so the second you see a skull icon - you are going to access the situation and then make a run for it (if the revive makes sense). We will drop everything to get it done. Which is why this gif is so funny, because it's totally accurate for a lot of us.

I also believe when you are dead, a little mini icon will pop up and show you the closest medic near you. I forget exactly where it is, and I'm pretty sure it's automatic. But if a medic is near you, it's like a little compass icon that even gives you like the feet distance they are from you. This will let you know if there isn't a medic near by, so you are free to revive early. 

I don't think there is anything you can do to flag a medic down once dead. The Skull icon is automatic. And the compass just lets you know if there is a medic near by, so it's worth waiting.

That said, not all media are good. And it's really something to access each game. Within the first 3 min, don't instant respawn. Wait and see. If after 3 min you have a horrible team with medics, then don't wait and just respawn when you want. That's my best advice. I still think most medics that play the class, play it for the class - because the weapon set doesn't make sense just to play for killing. But there is horrible medics that have no map awareness, and are awful at revives. There are also medics that dive in and revive people without a care in the world - only to get you instantly killed again (so they revive just for the points and don't access the situation and determine whether the revive makes sense).

Edit: 

Not sure what it is on PC, but on console right bumper lets you "call" enemies out. This is where you flag enemies. It's also the button you use as a medic to throw bandages at your team to heal them.

This button also serves as a command. So if you see someone with ammo, hitting the button while your cursor is on them will get your soldier you yell out they need ammo. Same goes for health. If you see a medic, put your cursor over them and press the button and you will yell that you need health (although a good medic should be healing
People constantly already. But sometimes we get distracted). You can't do this while dead, so no asking for revive. But figure this might help you if you didn't know how to ask for healing. Then jumps out bc he wants to snipe from the edge of the map I'd say theres way more variables to this game than "yep just the medic". You've got quite a skill ceiling as far as mechanics go. 

I could easily say you know. A game was lost because people spent too much time grouping up defending a flag that really only needed a support and 2-3 other players. 

I'd say anecdotally, the games I lose tend to be the premade squads / party feature where we have 4 squads of 2 people, forcing more scarce spawn points and people not really taking lanes in groups and trying to rambo it with 2 people. 

Its a convoluted game. Theres no 1 reason people win or lose. Sometimes the other team is just better. 

As far as medics go. Just sometimes step back and don't look at the immediate gain of 1 ticket back and realize its about net gains. That 1 ticket gained sometimes ends up losing 2-3 tickets altogether when you get killed right after the revive, the medic goes down and another medic trying to get both of them. 

And its all cumulative. Its these little things that add up over the match that end up costing a team dozens of tickets quicker than they may have happened.  PATCH YOURSELF UP, SOLDIER! HERE'S A MEDKIT! STOP IT! Howard Stark [the mother from finding nemo ](https://youtu.be/JCdVTlMDTT8)  We don't choose the medic life because it is easy. 
  I know that feel. Nearly done 1000 revives (currently ranked #360 for revives on PC ha!) I dare say a 1/3 of the people i try to revive disappear upon me reaching them. Infuriating.  Throw smoke did you try sniping them with your pistol? Yeah you tell em like it i-.... *looks at username*- [wait wait wait](https://media2.giphy.com/media/YAB2MHMzI26cM/200_s.gif) Just the other day I had a new coworker from Wisconsin say "The whole goat facing the cliff thing is a myth, but if you put water in rubber boots and put their front feet in 'em they'll freeze up and you can do anything. ".............

I'll never look at this guy the same way, and wish I could tag him irl as goat fucker  It's okay, he's a Cubs fan. The goat deserves it. Right? Do I sense some interspecies rivalry going on here?  1. Go to Wales if you want that research

2. Cause someone else tagged him as goat fucker https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/370uvj/found_this_as_a_review_on_tera/crivk2e Reddit Enhancement Suite adds this and other useful features.

I really hate having to be this guy. But my OCD is driving me crazy. It's ASSESS not ACCESS

 Thanks for the reply! I'm guilty of being a pretty terrible medic at the moment, I keep accidentally putting my gas mask on when I mean to do other shit.  Can confirm, am addicted to reviving people like it's crack That icon that shows any medics that are close by is in the bottom left. <3 >You see, revives are like crack for us....

As a hard support in almost every game this is the most true statement I have ever read. Absolutely, there are a million ways to have gotten those crucial few tickets back.  But waiting a few more seconds for a clear revive is about the easiest of them. :) me too thanks Mother? Mother! That was the only good part of that movie emotionally? because you don't *actually* see it. We choose it because we enjoy using the assault rifles in the class. We've all been in the piss, mate. Should I take smoke instead of incendiary? In a game like battlefield, throwing smoke for 1 revive is not really worth it.  In more of a realisting milsim, sure >hold up

#WHOA THERE [Hold up](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/T1kbk) [Presidential pardon.](http://commentphotos.com/gallery/CommentPhotos.com_1392847215.jpg) Ahahaha, I have to remember that one to use the next time I get someone buying into the whole sheep-in-boots thing. For some reason, no matter how little sense the things you're saying make, people believe you when you can provide lots of details. Even if the details are completely nonsensical.

Like somehow a goat can't move if it's wearing boots that happen to be full of ice. Two seconds of rational thought would tell you that it sounds silly that something that can leap up entire cliff faces suddenly can't even move with ice on its toes. But here you are... As someone who has proud Welsh heritage, we're not terribly attracted to goats. We prefer the softer curves of the Welsh mountain sheep. Check your sources please. can confirm. just tagged him as goat fucker.  I have him tagged as Goat Fucker for the exact same reason. I don't even remember the original story. just kidding I figured it out. you're tagged as the guy who helped me figure out tagging
 no it's seinfeld i just checked i think you're mistaken Only redditors deal in absolutes! I don't get it. Thank you for being that guy. 

Seriously I really enjoyed reading this whole thread so the first time I was like 'meh'. Then second post it happened again and it was just too far. :p It's cool. The fact that you are even asking questions, is awesome. I'm not a master medic by any means, but I've been playing the Medic class for the last 5 years (across different games). It's really fulfilling for me. To be honest, I'm not that good at Assault class, or anything that requires kills. I can be decent at it, but I don't have the reflex or the precision, to be great at it. So Medic class has always allowed me to shine.

I think the most important aspect, is having map awareness (where your teammates see it, and where the enemies are at) - and making sure your hang back and take care of them. They are the ones doing the heavy lifting with combat, so you are aiding them. You are an extension of them (as your healing keeps them alive).

Of course, you can play medic aggressive. I can get 7-9 kills a game. But the main focus should always be support. 

Another thing I would say is, be carful not to get tunnel vision. Once you get it down to notice death icons, there is a temptation to sprint to every dead body you see and instant revive them. But sometimes, you don't want to revive. If a dead body is right in the middle of a major gun fight, then diving in to revive - will just get you killed, and will also get the solder you revived killed again. And that doesn't help anyone. 

So always access the situation before deciding to revive. Sometimes you need to use your gun and kill the enemy, before you can dive in and revive someone. And sometimes, it's actually worth taking the risk and diving in (even if the situation is bad) - because in certain situations, you are trying to push the enemy back. And a risky revive can turn the tide around. It's a tricky thing. But practice makes perfect.

I edited my last post, but at the very bottom, I talk about how you can "call out for ammo or health". There is a button that does this. Same button you use to throw health packs out. But you can only use this alive. The old stuff may have had a few more on screen deaths but I feel like portrayal of human emotion has improved over time We choose it because of BC2 glory days mowing down people with LMGs So true, this was the only reason i started maining medic. But after a while i started getting the hang of reviving and healing. Still, the rifles are the most fun. Smoke is fun to play with. Enemies get weird when they are trapped in smoke. Things happen in the smoke. But seriously smoke is awesome. Just create multiple profiles for your Medic according to how you feel like playing. Here's mine, for example:

**Squad Pusher** - All Shoot-and-Move; offensive PTFO squad-centric; aggressive, movement oriented

* M1907 SL Sweeper; Iron-Sighted Rifle of choice
* Pistol of choice
* Bandage Pouch
* Medical Syringe
* Incendiary / Smoke (the former for offense contribution, the latter for Syringe Revival concealment)
* Bladed Melee (fast attacks)

**CLS Defender** - Holding back, fending off the enemies, defensively oriented

* Optical/Telescopic Rifle of Choice
* Pistol of Choice
* Medical Crate
* Rifle Grenade - FRG
* Gas Grenade
* Melee of Choice

**Chokepoint Medic** - When you absolutely cannot give up any ground, and/or you and your squad are clawing forward inch by inch; direct objective oriented

* Iron-Sighted or Optical Rifle of Choice
* Pistol of Choice
* Medical Crate
* Medical Syringe
* Frag Grenade
* Melee of Choice In BF4 I lived by smoke for medic-ing and other non-sniping roles. If they can't see you they can't kill you! :) Also a medic revive was worth a kill, so worth it in the end!   I run smoke on my support, and it's pretty good, but nothing quite matches the joy of seeing you're hitting 4 people with an incendiary.  

Then again, I had a team mate run in front of me as I was throwing my incendiary yesterday, and I burnt myself to death, so swings and round abouts. Smokes are great for reviving people, rushing a point to cap, throwing at tanks aiming for you, blocking a snipers view or just running through an area without getting shot.

Most of the time I miss with regular grenades and you get 2 so it can save your ass more than once in a life Like shootin' fish in a barrel. yeah goats are arab, horses are brazil Well of course, we wouldn't have even wasted our time  tagging a Welshman for fucking a sheep. Instead we got this weirdo here who fancies giving old Billy his Willy.  nah nah nah that's the one that span off cheer no

he is the right one I choose it because I'm incapable of killing more than one person per Match no matter what I try...

That's also why I try to revive without killing the enemy first, I'm hoping who ever I revive saves my sorry ass.  Are BC2 servers still up? Imagine a smoke grenade that kills people in the smoke. Yes please So you've seen Lost too huh? The smoke is so dense in this game it looks like I'm wearing a gray blindfold  My experiences in counter-strike has thought me this as well: take smoke. ***ITS HIGH NOON*** I thought Brazil was asses  I'll bet there's more of us than we think.

Happy Birthday by: Hideo Kojima Man, Konami really messed up treating him like they did.





[Fuck em](http://i.imgur.com/Hyh3veT.gifv) Hideo said they took this picture after they finished shooting the trailer for Death Stranding we saw today... which was way back in summer. Mads has a serious case of Resting Murder Face It must be tough being Mads Mikkelsen. He's probably a really good guy, but he looks so god damn sinister all the time. Even when smiling, Mads looks sinister. The man is insane.

I think this ongoing trailer of his is basically just an excuse for him to bro out with all his favourite actors. Not pictured: Geoff Keighley under the table presenting an extra special award to Kojima  Does kojima ever age Mads has some forearms! "Hey Konami, check me out with my awesome famous actor friends, you jealous?"
-Kojima, probably That's one beautiful 127 year old man Don't eat that cake, Hideo. You don't know what he put in it.. Mads seems like he's cool as shit. I'd eat a cake with him I have high hopes for death stranding. All star cast and god of the gaming community.  I met Mads in LA and he was such a nice guy. 

Currently watching through Hannibal as well. He's one of my favourite sinister villains.  They should've continued the Hannibal series.  Mads is so awesome, I rewatch hannibal every year just because I like him so much You know who'd lose their shit about this picture? /r/Denmark IL KEEP CUMMING Oh my goodness, it's Le Chiffre! Is that Le Chiffre from Casino Royale? What kind of shitty friends make you a birthday cake covered in fondant? I approve of Mads rise to power. May he have a long and terrible reign.

Seriously the guy is crazy talented, and an incredibly nice and humble person (met him at a horror convention, took time with every single person and apologized profusely for taking 5 minutes for a smoke break). I wish he could parlay any new success into getting Hannibal brought back. Wait, so the cake must symbolize the layers of Kojima's mind and the white frosting with one black band indicates his purity with an undercurrent of darkness. 

Notice the six candles? With proper inferences you can deduce it is a metaphor for a "sixth sense" which they both have obtained recently as you can see the fists or "grasping hands" are located parallel to the candles.

What sixth sense? Well thats up for debate but I would infer it represents an allegory for the narrative within Kojima's and now Mads' mind.

EDIT: You get it? Cuz everyone always analyzes the bejesus out of Kojima stuff! Its a joke! Haha. I'm a riot. God the size of that man's fist. Not gaming related but Mads is one of the most underrated actors ever.  That 25-year old on the right is 53.

(The dude in his 30s-40s on the left is 51). Mads Mikkelsen has slowly worked his beautiful self up the ladder to my favorite actors list.  It looks like they went to the Nicholas Winding Refn School of posing for pictures: http://imgur.com/a/NUzhb Which one's which?  Just to remind people how awesome Mads Mikkelsen is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy37ou-cjvI Hideo Kojima + Guillermo del Toro + Mads Mikkelsen + Norman Reedus = Death Stranding Wow sejt !!  I need to know what shirt Mads is wearing, anyone know? Or the one like it that isn't most likely $500  Come a long way from Casino Royale, Mads just seems like the guy that's too cool for school, but ain't no fool You know, I wonder if Mads being in Death Stranding is why Kojima tweeted quite a bit about Mads this summer.  As a gamer (not hardcore but not casual either) and a Hannibal fan. Too much awesome in one pic Kojima reminds me of that Japanese gaming CEO dude in Black Mirror Mads is one of the most under-rated actors ever. 
Check out "the Hunt" on Netflix if you want to cry.  and i mean manly clutch your stomach weeping on the ground cry. Was he the best, or the greatest Bond villain?  I wonder if Mads cooked anything for Hideo's birthday. We are going to know absolutely nothing about this game for so long, but I'm optimistic that Hideo will make something amazing.  This is a great fucking combo. Whatever comes out of this gonna be epic.

u/spez : Best Mikkelsen film you probably haven't watched, Pusher. Do yourself a favor. Mannnnn, i really want Hannibal to come back :( Happy Birthday Jewish? But does he live at the end of the Hunt? Is that Hannibal  If anyone wants to see how good Mads is I HIGHLY recommend watching the Hannibal TV series. His portrayal of Hannibal Lecter surpasses Anthony Hopkins by 10 miles.﻿ /r/madslads Fucking love Mads! (Not pictured: Geoff Keighley crying in a corner) hideo cutejima As a Dane, it's strange to see Mads Mikkelsen explode into the international scene like this. I remember watching him on this crime show - "Rejseholdet" - which was basically the Danish version of CSI. Now he's a villain in Doctor Strange, an Imperial scientist in Star Wars, and apparently some kind of shapeshifting military badass in a Kojima game. Girl nerd's pick for threesome. I am so glad they are working together. I think Mads plays a fantastic villain, and does a great job when he doesn't as well (like in Adams Apples) Hideo Kojima (Hideo Kojima) Hideo "Hideo Kojima" Kojima Translator's note: *Hideo Kojima* means "Hideo Kojima" Reminds me of Mr Bean's Holiday lol Ageing by: Hideo Kojima

Ultimately, this all just humiliated Konami even beyond what they had already done to themselves.

[FUCK KONAMI] (http://i.imgur.com/bVmmXj1.jpg) That  [Snake Eater trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVSRjJL1bv8) in the Fox Engine but for pachinko made me hate Konami.  My understanding is that they're making a ton of money off their pachinko stuff, and are much more profitable as a whole now.  So from a business perspective, they didn't mess up.

Saying this as someone who is insanely sad that the Castlevania IP is basically dead now.  At least we got Bloodstained coming up. Context? ok, that really made me laugh. thanks for that! Look at that smile from Andrew House, pure bliss. MGS 3 Pachinko hurts mang I will never forget the hour long MGS4 cut scenes.  Amazing game for its time, but fuck those cut scenes. pefectly paced cutscenes Can anyone give a real quick synopsis to what Konami did to Hideo?  You're right.

"When we did the shooting for today's teaser back in summer" Isn't Kojima in his fifties? The man looks like he's in his late 20's or 30's.

Maybe he takes the same vampire serum Will Smith does. [deleted] > Mads has a serious case of Sexy Resting Murder Face

FTFY.

 That's a discourteous description, vulgar; your projection only reflects an unspeakable ugliness.  

Please, join me tonight for dinner, I'll edify you with etiquette in order to avoid that ugliness in the future. I feel like he'd make a PERFECT witcher character. He could eat me any day( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  That's just the roles we know him for. He has a few roles as a protagonist and he does them nearly as well.  Well, back home in Denmark, everyone loves the guy. He's hilarious, and played in 2 of my favorite comedies ever (The Green Butchers and Flickering Lights)

Maybe it's just because he mostly plays villains when he's in English speaking roles. I think you misspelled sexy.  Don't quote me on this but I'm pretty sure he was a professional dancer, which is why a lot of his scenes in Hannibal look so gorgeously choreographed  He has Resting Putin Face Danish guy here. I met him a couple of years ago in Copenhagen. Super nice guy, very pleasant to talk to.  I think even more so though than when he's scowling. Got a great sinister face on him. Obligatory Hannibal plug, just finished the third season and it is one of the best shows I have seen. Mads is perfect as Hannibal Lecter. He had that thing down way back when he was just on Danish TV. He is a special looking fucker, but that's probably also a big part of why he is successful internationally now.  [You should have seen him in Pusher](https://www.google.dk/search?q=mads+mikkelsen+pusher&client=safari&rls=en&biw=1264&bih=793&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKstrm89XQAhUpD5oKHRpEApcQ_AUIBigB) https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5g2vbq/hideo_kojima_mads_mikkelsen/dap6pah Award Received by: Hideo Kojima "Geoff, I'm accepting this award tonight in the hope you will stop camping out on my lawn trying to give me awards.

Thanks, came to find out why they were together and it took forever to find a comment mentioning a game. Supposedly there are rumors of netflix wanting to do season 4, but we've been hearing that since season 3... [Relevant SATW](http://satwcomic.com/doctor-strange)  Why? And the bad guy from Doctor Strange, whatever his name was Yes. And the latest villain in Doctor Strange. He has a good face for a villain! White marzipan, friend, white marzipan.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Well he's getting his due recognition as of late. It started well before Hannibal and he's now kicking some serious ass in high budget movies like Dr. Strange, Rogue One and well, we shall see :) A little part of me hopes he sleeps with all the female cast in rogue one.

nothing... Oh god no By Hideo Kojima Sold by Hideo Kojima https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4055/4527498122_7e503a25d3_b.jpg Haha! ...wait... by Hideo Kojima When things went sour between Konami and Hideo during the development of MGSV, Konami removed Hideo's name from the box art.

http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/07/konami-removes-kojimas-name-from-metal-gear-solid-v-box-art/

As a response, Hideo added "credits" to each mission, which meant his name was displayed prominently every time a mission was started.

It was basically a "fuck you" to Konami on his way out the door. Mads Mikkelsen Kojima admits he has faults, he just doesn't care. He makes games he wants to play, that's the secret most successful game developers have. I'm curious how it makes fun of kojima? It looks more like Sony is acting like a cheapskeet by wanting to make low budget and fast developed titles 

Edit:I get it now, thanx for explaining it to me I'm not sure about Western cultures, but generally in Asian cultures, it's considered polite and magnanimous not to burn bridges even when leaving employers. Not defending what Konami did though, fuck em. I'm not sure how many British developers there are, but I'd imagine them tutting quietly under their breath as they angrily sip their tea. What's going on? Konami is releasing an updated version of Snake Eater on an arcade machine?  [You think that's bad? See this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVH5SffJfDI) Oh totally. Konami's made bad artistic decisions but fantastic business ones.  When Kojima left Konami, this was an announcement from Sony together with him, that he will still make games, for Sony. (I think it was at E3? Can't check) Hideo Kojima parted ways with Konami about a year ago and then an [announcement](https://youtu.be/annuTcmB1rw) was made, stating that Kojima Productions would be partnering with Sony.

  53 now.  He's Asian. We do not age between 30-60. Most Asians and black folks age very well.  It's all those Thetans that keep you young. 

Something something volcano something alien souls something L. Ron Hubbard bar bet. Well now you're just pulling random dates out the air! that's just crazy talk, man. I love it. SRMF  http://i.imgur.com/sWXaRoH.gif Eat the rude. Sure I could stand to be edified. Yurd, ma dood? Yea Mads can play both. The Hunt is a good example. Oh man,The Hunt is probably my favourite acting from him aside from Hannibal. Idk, have you seen him in Dr Strange though?  I may be one of the minority in this but I watched the god awful movie Wrath of the Titans (or whatever it was called). It had Mikkelsen as the tough supporting guy which was suspicious of the hero at the beginning but grows fond of him and even sacrifices himself in the end. He was the good guy in it and he was freaking perfect.  Even when he is the "hero" he is creepy af. Like in Vallhala Rising.  Eh, I haven't seen him before today but I agree he does look sinister.  >The Green Butchers

Actually thinking about it, The Green Butchers could be taken as a foreshadowing of his work on Hannibal. Those two movies are always what I recommend to people who want to watch some danish comedy.  I saw a youtube vid of him doing the can-can. He can kick those legs really high. Very sinister :

Not even kidding. Thank you for subscribing to Mads Facts! Did you know that Mads actually starred in a Danish film, in which he plays the role of a butcher, whose store is about to go bankrupt until he starts chopping up people and selling them disguised as marinaded pork?

 It's a shame he was disgustingly wasted as a villain in Dr Strange. What a missed opportunity.  imagery in that show haunts you for a while. I binge watched first season. won't be doing that again. How was season 3? I kinda gave up after the first 3 episodes cause I got really bored, I loved the first 2 seasons. And he's such a great actor. He normally looks like an evil guy, but in The Hunt, he seems such a nice, caring guy. “Du sidder da ikke og stikker dine fissefingre ned i min armagnac!” Award Received by: ~~Hideo Kojima~~ Geoff Keighley It's kinda like seeing that one kid at school hug his mom, then pointing and saying, "Haw Haw he loves his mom!"

Light hearted, childish ribbing. ;) Nah because low hanging gay jokes yield better karma.  He actually did great as host yesterday. What about if he colds 70? What then? But are they sexy? Thank you, this made me laugh Can't wait to pick it up along with the new Tool album.  We can plug it straight into our templejack neuronets! Oh, wow! It's coming out before the next Elder Scrolls? Because Mads Mikkelsen is Danish and we're very proud of him. Mads is Danish. Very famous there. See the comment by /u/phantuba - it explains it very, very well. Bumblebee Cabbagepatch? > [White marzipan](http://files.gamebanana.com/img/ico/sprays/marzipan.png) True, also The Hunt is a modern classic imho.

BEAN Parasite Unit BROTHEEEER!!

*TEDDYYYYY!!* World by Hideo Kojima Holy fuck is this a real label?  - Michael Scott

      By Hideo Kojima Not really true. The game was made to play out like a TV show from the beginning, meaning credits for each episode. It wasn't changed to be a response to the box art fiasco.  I like how you made up a "fact" considering you have literally no idea if that was the reasoning or not. by Hideo Kojima Same goes for books; write the books you'd want to read, with the stories you want to tell, rather than the books you want other people to read, with stories you think they want to be told. Shit, that's what I've always heard as advice in creative endeavors.

Is there a game you want to play that no one is making? Make it.

Is there a book you want to read, but no one is writing it? Write it.

And so on. I've heard that as far back as... Fourth grade or some such, like fourteen years ago. Some secret. You just told everyone! He certainly has a particular artistic vision for his games, probably most evident in Death Stranding and P.T. Im glad though, it feels like he is having fun and exploring how far he can mix art and gaming.

I'm liking it though, I think this type of abstract unreliable narrator horror survivor isn't something we have really seen in gaming. If he has great sound design in game as well, I would be totally immersed.  That's true in theory but you also tend to convince yourself that it's something you would want to play/read/watch after spending so much time on it. It's easy to lose perspective and get stuck up your own ass on things like this.

Kojima is a great developer and he respects the medium more than most but I think he would do well to get some real, no-bullshit peer reviewing and constructive criticism. I'd love to see him go somewhere like Rock Star just to see what sort of crazy shit would happen. It'll never happen and it's most likely a horrible idea from a financial standpoint but holy shit there would be some crazy things going on in that studio.
I'm pretty sure at least one person involved would just completely lose their mind. People forget that some of the worst games (and other creative endeavors) are made that way too - even by really good creators.

George Lucas and the prequels come to mind. He's a very creative soul with some good ideas that just needed some tempering and editing. By the time of the prequels (and maybe Return of the Jedi) nobody could really say no, so he wasn't able to grow as an artist. In the designing world you get to pick 2/3

Low budget.

Quick turn around.

Quality product.

The boss upstairs will always pick the first two with designer almost always fighting for the last one. Been doing this for 10+ years now. It's a shitty game. I mean MGS 5 went massively over budget and took years to make and it still wasn't all the way done. Kojima takes a long time to make games It's because Kojima went way over budget for MGS 5 in both time and money plus the "perfectly-paced cutscene" line is a bit of a joke I imagine because some of them go a bit too long at times. His storylines aren't the most approachable or easily grasped, his cutscenes have been long and absurd, etc. I played the first MGS because of its reputation, but good lord, I had no idea what was happening a good portion of the time. [removed] As someone in the industry, you definitely don't want to burn bridges because chances are you'll end up working with people again from that prior company. It really is a small industry and once you've worked at a large studio, you realize that for every other studio out there, you're working with someone that either used to work there or they know someone that went there.  It's called saving face.  They're cutscenes that play on the screen while playing pachinko. They're releasing a Snake Eater version made with the Fox Engine maxed out for pachinko machines. Pachinko machines are basically very popular in Japan and they're like a slot machine with pinball elements. [This is a really interesting video about pachinko machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2iJLy-1IGg) Wait... What was that?!  Please tell me this is real please tell me this is real oh my god I didn't realize how badly I wanted this until I saw this video

Time to kill myself [Obligatory.](http://www.geekinheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/average_asian_woman_aging.jpg) Hirohiko Araki, the author of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is 56 and he looks like [this](http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/fbc7b366720c2de4d72ac8b0a148c6be1480511389_full.jpg)

[He also dresses better than a lot of his younger contemporaries apparently](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/11/30/perennially-fabulous-hirohiko-araki-wins-best-dresser-award) Then when you go over 60 age hits you like a semi truck. What happens at 60 and a day?  and keanu reeves I think while this is partly true, some of it is because the signs of aging our society looks for are determined by a euro-centric (white) point of view.  I'd be curious if this is still true to someone who grew up in Asia or Africa, where whites are not the majority.  Just a hypothesis, I by no means have data to support this. Hot damn. I'll bring the wine! Damn that movie is good.  Fucking hard to watch though.  Very thought provoking and emotional. The Hunt is a fantastic film. That one is in my queue to watch. You mean almost exclusively Vallhala Rising. In a lot of his Danish language films he's either goofy or quite sweet.  Don't forget Adam's Apple. Wtf...  
Coming from Hannibal, this looks ...different.. That movie is sooo fucking weird What's this from?  YES. Only once though, even makes me sad and mad at the same time reading the title  He is on a hannibal lector level in westworld atm, they differ on their performance but they both do it graciously and terryfing. Meh, i think they're both great. I feel like they both played refined and sinister psychopaths, but Mads was perhaps a shade more charismatic.  Mads is my favorite actor these days. Love him as Hannibal. The Hunt was fantastic. 

Check out The Salvation. Best Danish-American western of all time! Hopkins really fucking pulls off his role on Westworld now though, like holy shit. Subscribe.  why would I ever want to unsubscribe to this?? more! In Men and Chicken, he looks like someone with an uncontrollable masturbation habit. Geoff Keighley by Hideo Kojima 100% agree. I regret being douchey about Geoff a few years back when he was making his rounds as the Dewrito Pope. Now that I'm older, I have more understanding and respect for what he does.  Hot Coldman. Find out next week on: r/forearmporn  ! I heard it'll be bundled with HL3 Oh nice! They should be. Beyond that, he keeps doing Danish movies even though I'm sure he gets much more profitable deals from abroad. 

For those interested and who does not mind watching non-English movies, what I see as his greatest work of all is [Jagten (The Hunt)](http://imdb.com/title/tt2106476/), a movie about the consequences of neighbourhood vigilantism and judgement before evidence is presented. > very proud of him.

*Mad* about him. [Ayy](http://satwcomic.com/doctor-strange) I meant the villain character can't not read it in homestar runner's voice Makes sense, the whole game is a story of his birthday

 That...jesus that actually makes a lot of sense in a really warped way.  He's his own father? Philip J. Fry would be proud. > MEOW!

by Hideo Kojima >Hideo "Thats not what I meant when I said ' Hideo 'Please don't call me 'Hideo "Hideo Kojima" Kojima' Kojima" Kojima

FTFY I'd take it as an incredibly arrogant PC. Probably explains why my plot is so obtuse.  Doesn't look like anything to me. Not forgetting Bean Ocelot Background by Hideo Kojima Kojima knew he was getting fired before ground zeroes was even released. He changed the story of MGSV to reflect that and using what they had dev'd and made a game. That's why the cinematics you saw 2 years ahead of time were the entire game already. 

It became a game about losing everything he had. Kojima last night said he thought he lost everything. There's a bonus Ground Zeroes mission about erasing the MGS titles he worked on and how even if they erase the markings the memories will always be there.

As a long time die hard Kojima fan people don't realize how Kojima tends to shape his games to reflect his ideas/life/etc. 

Did he decide to do that specifically to spite Konami? Maybe not. But a great deal of MGSV does reflect on his situation with Konami. MGSV will always be Kojima's Phantom Pain.  What kills most great TV series is fan service. You start out writing the story you want to tell, then 4 seasons in you have all these fans who have ideas about what they want to see. So you start trying to give them what they want instead of writing the most compelling story.  Sometimes when I reread what I wrote, I get excited like reading a new book.

That's when I know I did something right. Totally true. Also, a lot of people get disappointed when their friends don't get as excited about their writing as they did. The reality is that their friends probably just aren't the target audience. "I believe in doing what I like. I set about selling it afterwards."

-Mervyn Peake

 Just dance like nobody's watching bro In 5th grade me and my cousin wrote out this idea of a game were you just live life, like as an adult. Get a job, design your house, have a family if you want. We thought it'd be amazing and you could do some really interesting things with it. a number of years later, the sims released. "See a need, fill a need" - Rodney Copperbottom  SELL YOUR STOCKS EVERYONE, HE'S DONE. Kojima has worked with others before. Hell before Silent Hills was cancelled he was working with other great minds like Junji Ito and del Toro.

He makes great games. They may be a bit wacky at times but that's because it's a video game, he doesn't see the need for it to he serious all the time. Indeed another part of it is creative people can spend their entire lives working on what makes them a success then they need to do that a again but bigger in maybe 1-2 years or they're a "failure". The boss of course picks all three but only focuses on the first two and blames the developer when the third wasn't done. Kojima claims he missed the target ship date for mgs5 by only a few months and came in under budget. Konami didn't say anything about it. In any case a bit part of it was just how comparably expensive traditional game developement is versus mobile. Mobile is also where the big money is in japan. The over budget shit is speculation based on one composer who was told to write 12 songs for MGSV and they only used 4. The ending of MGS4 holds the record for longest cutscene sequence in a video game at 71 minutes long.

 Oooohhh,now I get it.thanx for enlightening me.I didn't follow the development of mgs 5 quite closely  Yeah I would never dream of publicly burning a bridge at a past employer regardless of how shitty they treated me. Don't think this is exclusive to Japanese game devs It isn't being professional. It is something corporate overlords have come to ingrain into people, much like talking about salary is supposed to be a big no-no also ingrained into people by corporations. 

Corporations have more to gain from not having people tell all than the reverse. Odds are if you left a place you were unhappy about working at you won't be going back and maybe can prevent others from being miserable. I think it is more unprofessional to allow people to blindly go into a place expecting it to be a good place to work and then finding out what you already knew. Hey, I can't *choose* to age into an adult but, I can choose to be mature or not, *because I'm an adult*... Stinky head! There's a cultural difference at play as well. In the west if you're as much of a creative badass/legend as Kojima your ego and your art tends to supercede the importance of any company that you might do business with, whether they intend to help or impede you. Japanese worker culture is such that other development companies would seriously think twice about hiring Kojima if he even spoke publically about the series of events surrounding the whole Kojimagate affair. Sony seems to be above some of that but Kojima would still lose a lot of face if he complained whereas people in the West would just be cheering for him regardless of if he looked like he was whining about a massively ingrained social hierarchy. And many times what is 'professional' is just corporations' expression of their power over the working class. rofl

Screw these actors and their vampire abilities.  That's because he's a vampire And Elijah Wood. Am Asian, we think white people age too early. I concur.  Yer i cried hard at that film. But after having various conversations about the films issue I still can't say how I would react to someone in that position Of corse not, my bad. You should see some of the Danish comedy movies he's done. I've forced many of my brit friends to watch the Green Butchers. Hilarious and dark.  It's from 'Men and Chicken' and you gotta watch it. If you have a high tolerance for a wild and strange ride type of movies, watch it. If you check his filmography, his earlier movies are closer to this (weird comedies and funny-looking characters). Men & Chicken Said this in another thread, it is incredible... like you hate life incredible. Hopkins in Westworld may be one if the best TV performances I have seen in years He's in Westworld?? To be fair, Hopkins got very limited screen time and Mikkelesn got three seasons, hard to compare directly. I think the extra character development is what makes the show's version preferable to me.

Which is why the end of MGS2 mindfucked 8th grade me.

    *cough* Otherwise known as the "CW effect." *cough* Game of Thrones and Daenerys storyline? I know this feeling exactly; if your own work can move you at all, you're doing something right for your story. And hopefully there'll be people out there who'll like it as much as well; even shitty fanfics I wrote 13-14 years ago that could get me excited/emotive whilst proof-reading got some positive feedback, so I must've been doing something right! Yeah... though the friends bit is kinda hard on you. They can proof-read and point out mistakes, but they aren't necessarily going to overly like your work, and catering to them can make it undermine your own vision, which just... sucks. Well... You and your cousin were right, I guess. Plot twist, cousin published Sims, claimed all of the credit while excluding you. Plot Twist: They are the creators of Roy and Roy 2: Dave in the future. [Jones in the Fast Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_in_the_Fast_Lane) and [Little Computer People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_People) were precursors to these kind of games, if you're interested in some gaming history.

The first one is definitely still playable and a lot of fun if you never tried it. Literally in the middle of that right now...

Bosses: "Hey we know you designed everything perfect for this last catalog and everything flows very well and the information is really easy to absorbs but we're gonna need you to change it up while still making it just as intuitive."

Thedaveness: fuck you. You'd have thought that Kojima would have garnered some leeway over the years... This is why sequels tend to suck. MGSV had multiple planned chapters that weren't developed at all because Kojima was out of time/money. In engine, at that! It wasn't just ending the game, it was ending the whole Solid Snake storyline. There were a lot of loose threads to tie up.

But yeah, it was damn long. To be fair, it was a great ending. mgs 4 was released in mid 2008, and mgs 5: phantom pain was released late 2015. I imagine konami execs got fed up waiting for more than 7 years just for a single game and just kicked out kojima and go full pachinko now. Maybe that's a problem though.  Employers have employees over a barrel, maybe if enough talent started talking about abusive or egregious employment situations and people started refusing to work for those companies, those practices would be less common. My friend left his job without giving his 2-weeks because he "didn't want to make his new job wait, and think he didn't want to go." I tried to tell him how stupid that is, and any big company will not only understand that you need to put in a 2-week notice, but also respect it. What's to say you won't do the same to them if a different job rolls around?  Here's an upvote for using common sense.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ht4dbyPIcM

Every family has one, it's more of a generic term for old man in Japanese, I didn't think anything of it. 

Well, one night at a bbq I meet him. 

Holy shit. I've never met another human being as old (and who looked old) as him. He was 101. He couldn't have been more than 4' tall. He looked like a leather muppet. He spoke with a crazy weird accent too (I think he may have grown up speaking more Ryukan than Japanese). 

He was bright, alert, and all there. He even made some vaguely racist jokes about me. 

You don't know old until you've seen Japanese old. Older than that is Okinawa old, as they are apparently one of the longest living populations on the planet.  Keanu actually is part Chinese

I guess the immortality genes cancelled each other out. A pessimist would say hes half MC Holy shit!  Pretty soon he's going to have to disappear in a mysterious boating accident and reappear in another few decades as an unknown Norwegian icefisher.  Exactly the movie makes you angry and sad at how easy it is to affect someone's image and how hard it is to prove them wrong. To say that Danish comedies are "dark" is an understatement. They're dark to such an absurd degree that it ends up becoming part of the comedy. Taste my marinade. Really? It doesn't look like anything to me. Same.  The whole cast has done a great job, but Hopkins just kills it every time he's on screen.  I just hope he makes it through the finale and we at least get him for another season or two.

I'd also say Ed Harris has been doing a fantastic job as well.  I can only hope we get another Ford/MiB scene in the final episode.   It's close, but Matthew McConaughey in True Detective takes the cake for me. Anthony Hopkins plays a better hannibal than Anthony Hopkins' hannibal in Westworld.  Yeah. And he's killing it. I watched some videos analysing his face during scenes, the nuances are so masterfully done.

Edit: the video
https://youtu.be/4kSGkGKwp9U Yeah, and he's been killing it.  Hopkins has been almost playing a better Hannibal on Westworld.   [deleted] That's really cool.

You're really, really not wrong.  *Carry on my wayward souuun!*     What does CW stand for? Undoubtedly. Ya, I remember calling him when I read about it and he was like "I wish we'd have made that!" And I was all, Ya cuz a couple of junior high/middle school students coulda done this! He fuckin would, what a douche. Makes sense when you play the game.  The opening prologue with the amazing cinematic events disappeared halfway through the game.  I fell asleep when the credits started to roll. The next day my cousin starts speaking about how Big Boss appeared after that to set things straight, etc.. I didn't believe him lol. Had to re-finish the game next night.  As a MGS4 defender, I was always impressed that they bothered to wrap up so many hanging threads in the ending. I thought there was no way they were going to resolve everything that was going on in that game story-wise. It took over 70 minutes, but I'm glad they were able to do it! Sure, a lot of employers are shitty. But, honestly, a lot of employees are also shitty. For every 10 people you hear badmouth their former employer, I'd guess that five of them were just shitty employees and were treated fairly.  Normal parts of human nature isn't going to disappear because people talk about it.  Exactly. We can debate whether its philosophically correct or not, but there's a saying that "perception is reality." It's not just about caring what your ex-employer thinks of you, but how your potential future employers might perceive it when they don't know the full story.

Half life 3 by Hideout Kojima confirmed (gonna fucking hate myself for even typing it...) well, "olicity" fans. Fuck.  Uncle Guggie. Supernatural's been on a roll recently as well! Season 11 was their best since season 5 in my mind. They'll cock it up soon enough. The invasion story was pretty good. I haven't watched arrow this season so I was a little out of the loop with the two new guys, but they were minor enough that it didn't matter.  I stopped following Supernatural around the time Crowley became in charge of Hell. Am I missing out on anything? SANA DA BEECH It all makes sense now! [My god!](https://i.redditmedia.com/W8bhkeUdAwoRy6eaLC2bO6iRHffrwbRgywYz0qL9Zaw.jpg?w=1024&s=5ef2c7cac4f6d297ceac1e72f2ef0817) I can understand not liking something. But sending death threats and telling an actress to kill herself? What is wrong with (some, not you I hope) people...

Both sides. Are. Crazy. I just watch it, go "meh, not that good" or "Hey, I liked that" and that is it.  Damn that TV cast has to be so fucking rich by now. It definitely picks up in my opinion. Granted, I've always been a fan of the series, so I'm a little bit biased.

I *will* say, if you watched Supernatural for Crowley, don't watch a single other episode. He goes from puppet master to butt monkey very quickly. And then we began to wait for 2-3 years for the game to be finished. I can't wait for the post about not pre-ordering. Is this before or after she tripped over Knack 2? We have to hold the beer because she's still not 21 yet. So I bought this game last year and when I saw that part II was coming out, I decided to actually sit down and play it.

I started playing it at like 3pm yesterday. I stopped at like 5am when I realized I worked in 3 hours. Damn this game is fucking gripping. So fucking awesome. Need to go home right now and finish it :\

Edit: The game is 'The Last of Us' (Playstation Exclusive). The image refers to the teaser of 'The Last Of Us II' now being in development by Naughty Dog. It's a zombie survival game that won like every award on the planet. [Wiki Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us) You forgot KNACK 2 BABY! Still waiting for kingdomhearts for the PS4. But "hold my beer" is for prefacing bad decisions....  Cool. Now I can get a second game on my PS4.  At least I can change my ID on Xbox. I'm still stuck with the same name I came up with in high school. That was awhile ago. It's embarrassing now! Let me change my name, Sony! I mean, im buying this game but this post is fucking stupid People who post this type of shit aren't even old enough to drink.  I never understood why fans get involved in the console wars. Both consoles are essentially the same. I own both, because they're both great. Meanwhile, Nintendo's like, "It's-a me! Mario 'I'm-sold-out-everywhere-even-though-it's-only-8-bits' Mario!" Which is weird given Project Scorpio is coming out next year.  You'd think people would wait and be buying PS4 Pros right now. i'm never going to understand giving the slightest fuck about which console sells more.  [facepalm](http://imgur.com/9mNj1J7.jpg) Unless you've actually got shares in either Sony or Microsoft, why do people actually care so much about which multi million pound corporation is making the most money? Is it because of how warm your beer is going to get while it sits in your hand for 3 years before this comes out?

Greatness awaits. Who upvotes this garbage low effort shit Legit question here guys: I have TLoU, but never got around finishing it. I'm still early in the game. Mainly because it got too scary for me at times, all this jump scare shit has always been terrifying to me. Is knowing the fact that the kid doesn't die in it gonna ruin the game for me if I decide to play it? I have a feeling the Scorpio will take the market. Xbox momentum has been such that people seem to be as hyped about Red Dead Redemption and Mass Effect being _backwards compatible_ than new games even like TLoU2 Guess I need to read more gaming articles or something to follow along....? Better get ready to hold that beer until 2018/19 🍺 Honestly, everyone is a winner here...

The consoles keep flip flopping leaders so the corporations behind them keep pushing out bigger and better stuff to retake the lead.  We all get higher quality hardware and software as a result.  The only thing that suffers is my wallet :-) I can't wait to play this on my new PS4 Pro Slim that I get for $199 during a Black Friday deal (with the game included) in 3-4 years! /cringe Shit like this makes me want to join pcmr if only it was on PC. Our ps4 died this weekend when we have had it for 7 months. Seeing this trailer has made me super salty. What game is this?  Is this true? I thought I saw something about huge ps4 sales after pro came out.  Is there much of a difference between the two consoles?  Aren't they pretty much the same? I always think these exclusives screw over the gaming community. I don't think I have ever been tempted to drop a huge amount of money on a different console for a specific game.  I wonder if the game will be finished before they release it? I'm not holding a beer for 3 years. *Best selling console for the last 4 months in America, still being outsold 2:1 in europe
 And fuckssakes. I was all on board with Sony, especially after the horseshit surrounding the Xbox One release. But to learn that Sony is limiting Mods for Skyrim...that's the deal killer for me. Gotta go with the Xbox One. Sorry, Sony. I believed in you. I trusted you. You fucked me. Switch is better. *Drops mic* Bloodborne alone, is worth buying a ps4. PC: funny how they need to specify consoles only. As much as I love LoU, I don't think it's a console seller for "most" people. Yay! Time for Sony to get lazy and make stupid decisions because they're on the top again! I too can't wait for "Interactive Zombie Movie 2 -  Electric Boogaloo"  I'll probably get downvoted for this, but I just want Naughty Dog to go back to games like Crash and Jak & Daxter with the PS4's hardware, with a VR mode maybe

I really enjoyed the Uncharted games on PS3, but Last of Us felt like it was retreading too much for me to get into. As much as the storytelling shines I feel like cover-based shooting gameplay has really exhausted itself and when the consoles die off in the next 5 years sony will be left with nothing. I'll enjoy buying a PS4 Slim for this. Then next year play some real 4K on a Scorpio. HEY SONY QUIT DRINKING ON THE JOB AND FINISH KINGDOM HEARTS 3 This doesn't make any sense...   
After saying "Hold my Beer"  the person usually goes on to do something extremely stupid injuring themselves....   
How does this fit the context AT ALL???   
LEARN YOUR GOD DAMN MEMES BRO!! Exclusives. The main reason I couldn't give two shits to even get into console gaming while having a PC that runs things better.

Why oh why do I have to buy a worse performing box to play these "game of the years". I hate exclusivity :/ You can make the shittiest post on /r/gaming and will get upvoted as long as its about the trending game. Fuckin fanboys. Can't believe this shit reached FP  Childish post.  Hold my beer while I do 4000 pushups. Thats 4K. Oops. Looks like I couldnt do it. Damn you xbox. You win again. I own consoles; as a PC guy, I just laugh at the absolute pointless bickering between consoles. They all have their wonderful features, and their flaws. Be smarter than that.

also, the last guardian is what I've been waiting for forever! Is this meme meant to prove that Sony fans constantly purchase things based on hype? I can't afford one. I don't think I can handle this situation. 0_0 Don't by a console for just one game, nor let only one game be your deciding factor to buy a console or not.

There should be at least 3 games or more that **you** want to play on said console to make it worth it.

[Edit] Wording I feel like the only gamer on the planet who doesn't have a raging hard on for TLOU or Naughytdog. I'll stick with my PC Here I am..with my pc Edit: Sony: Hold my sake Oh my fucking god, this sub is so fucking terrible. Lol hold my beer while I jack up the price of PS plus membership while not adding any extra value. Oh almost forgot to give out two indie games that no one was interested in. Go home Sony. You're drunk. Honestly have to say I was disappointed by the trailer, can't exactly say why. Just seemed a bit generic.  Stop with this nonsense. Xbox is killing it right now  It's almost 2017 and people still fight over consoles like if we're still on the Nintendo vs Sega age. I didn't think the trailer looked that good tbh.  Meanwhile, everyone on PC laughing their asses off. I know I'm in the minority, but I didn't think The Last of Us was anything all that special, its a fun and fine game, but some people praise it as if its the pinnacle of gaming and act like its the second coming of christ, and I just don't get that. Platform exclusives are a lame idea. Really bad for the gaming community overall. I wish they wouldn't do this. Sony just needs a brack friday bunduru Bruh im still waiting for the last fucking guardian.... But the wait is always worth it. Especially since it's Naughty Dog. They make good fucking shit. Better make it 3-4 years. Gotta factor in wait time for the 40Gb release day patch. If it needs that long to be perfect I'm okay waiting.  That's gonna be one warm ass beer. Holy thread backfire batman! and this is difference with MS policy lately. They announce game which will come out pretty soon so we dont have to wait and I think this is much better IMO.

And if they did announcement for every game in span of 2-3 years then it would maybe be richer then latest Sony conference with trailers made mainly out of indie games or 3rd party games.

I liked the conference and cant wait for this games to come out, but I like later announce much more. Same with Bethesda and Fallout 4. This way we didn´t even had to wait year or two.. it was like 6 months or what. It was pretty great and now imagine it this came out in 6 months. I shit you not morning of the trailers release, open up shop and within 20 mins this teen comes running in asking to preorder last of us 2 and when I told him it wont be in my system considering it was announced fucking 20 minutes ago he asked to leave money behind with his name just in case, like c'mon dude you could pre order it in a year and still have a copy aside Pre-orders killed my family.  My Documents > Copypastas > Pre-Ordering

Honestly, [DEVELOPER] has a pretty clean track record. Just look at [GAME] or [GAME_2] and you'll see that pre-ordering is fine. I personally still feel confident in pre-ordering from Naughty Dog because their track record is on point. They have never released a buggy unfinished game and they are one of my favorite game companies.  That would be the argument usually. But this was a dope ass first game in reddit's eyes. They are gonna create an exception for this game. Because reddit is filled with hypocrites.

Edit: yes, it is hypocrisy because the argument is always "Don't pre-order". There is no tiny clause after stating what companies are good and bad to pre order from. I agree with the developers mentioned below. But it doesn't change the fact of the reddit hive mind on this subject.     https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5gh4nn/the_last_of_us_part_ii_got_me_like/ They can fuck themselves I'm pre-ordering  [Knack is back baby!](http://i.imgur.com/osJ0YDG.png?2) After. You can see how she carries the disappointment in her eyes over Knack 1, which is only compounded by seeing an announcement for Knack 2. Am I the only one who actually enjoyed playing Knack? :( Yeah because in the zombie apocalypse drinking ages are super well enforced http://Imgur.com/a/MY210 I'm 19 and I can buy legally alcohol, so obviously I'm from Canada.  "Oy! When's your birthday?" 

"22nd of February."

"What year?"

"Every year.." How old is she supposed to be in this one? She'll be 21 when the game comes out If there is grass on the field, play ball. The multiplayer had surprising immersion to it as well. It's rough now but I hope it comes back with improvements.  How come you waited a year before playing it?  Is it a long game? My advice: Get some sleep, tackle it when you're rested.  You don't half-ass TLoU.  It deserves your full attention. Also for those that don't know you can play the game on PC by subscribing to PS Now and downloading the app. They had a 7 day trial going not too long ago. There does seem to be a slight latency in the controls though. >BAYBEEEEEEEEE!

Fixed that for you. hope you're still in prime shape at 80 years old I've seen that it's also already somehow available for pre-order on both consoles and also heard rumors it will be released on both. Know anything about that? Seems unlikely, but who knows Or doing something fucking gnarly! Me too! My first was No Mans Sky :( My PS4 is behind 2 or 3 system updates. In 2 years when this game releases, I might have sold it already. We'll see though. Right? I kept TLoU Remastered, Battlefront, MGSV and a few other games, but only because I'm too lazy to trade them away. I haven't even had the thing set up for more than a year now. Maybe once TLoU2 or The Last Guardian come out... I dont know what the first one is but youre missing out on some great games, bloodborne, infamous ss, uncharted collection and 4, god of war 3 remastered, TLOU and im probably missing a few. 




If you dont play these then you probably shouldn't have bought a ps4 in the first place.
 More embarrassing than poopoobagoo? Wait seriously? I borrowed my friends' ps3 in high school and made an account just so I could sign in, and I got a ps4 a little while ago and have yet to bother trying to change the name. Can you really not do it at all? Am I seriously stuck with IM_BATMAANN ?

edit: accidentall forgt a ltter  For a totally reasonable amount of $10! :( Truth.  This sub is cancer. Hold my Capri Sun. The vast majority of people who post, vote and comment in this sub aren't old enough to drink.  [deleted] > I own both

RIP Wii U
 Not everyone has that much money, poeple want the best one for their money, thus debate. I have the Xbox One and the only quarrel I have with it is no Spotify app :( I was a stupid fan boy (of ps2 then xbox 360) until my brother got a ps4 and i gifted him an xbox one.  Both are great consoles. 

If I had to pick one I'd pick xbox, simply because in my house we have a windows 10 computer as a media center in the living room and my bedroom.

Point is,  yes,  the consoles differ a bit.  But which console is better for you is entirely subjective. Owning both is also a nice option if the money isn't an issue. But one console has a better controller so obviously *everything* about that console makes it better. I have a ps4 and I'm waiting for a Nintendo switch. Only thing I do want from Xbox one is forza.   I got only one concole, but im not bashing the blue ones all the time, only because im from the green ones... I like phil spencers opinion on the useless concole war. We are all gamers. Only thing that matters. Suck the games dick, not the consoles dick. I'm all for like, playing your favorite but god I can't stand console fanboys. It's because you're looking at arguments posted by children.

It's their version of politics. When I was 12 I wanted a psp more than anything. We went into GameStop and asked the guy about them. 

He said "sony knows how to make cool looking stuff and has a lot of gimmicks, but Nintendo actually knows what they are doing." 

At the time I thought that guy was such a dick. 

I realize now he was dropping real wisdom. Pretty much every Nintendo system aside for GameCube for whatever reason is worth its weight in gold, and everyone else's isn't worth the space in the trash. 

Nintendo is the electronic equivalent to Eminem. Well the Scorpio looks to be significantly stronger than the Pro, so who knows what the market will look like in one year's time. I think it's about the multiplayer experience. If all your friends have PS4s then you will buy a PS4 so you can play with them, and Xbox One loses more and more business as the spread of PlayStations gets wider. The same happens if all your friends have Xbox Ones; you will be more likely to buy an Xbox and PlayStation will continue to lose market share. 

Because there is little difference in the games (most games are offered on both platforms except for a few signature series like Halo and The Last of Us), they are very close substitutes. HI WELCOME TO /R/GAMING No, understanding why she doesn't die is important. [deleted] I'm loving ME3. I forgot how addicting the multiplayer is. I for one was waiting for red dead to be backwards compatible before making the switch.  I finally figured it out. The Last of Us 2 is coming out.

Is there information out there that this game will run in 4k on the PS4 Pro? Please join You should. We have cookies and higher frame rates. If it's not on PC, it may as well not exist. You have it on warranty for a year, contact sony!  The Last of Us Part 2 The only difference is console exclusives: Microsoft has Halo, Forza, Rare Replay, and Gears of War

Sony has Bloodborne, Last of Us (1 and 2 now) MLB, Ratchet and Clank, God of War, and a few upcoming games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone and the whole VR thing. 

Other than that, they all have a large ass overlap with pretty much every title.  Wait what? I never played Skyrim, I have an xbone, and am interested in Skyrim, but I thought if I wanted mods I'd have to get for PC. This is not the case? You're acting as if the mods available on the Xbox are the best there are.  Why would anyone compare console sales with pc sales though? Im pretty sure most people who buy PCs don't even buy them for gaming. Based on the direction MS has taken with the Xbox, I think the only console that will die out will be the PS4.  The Xbox provides far more content besides gaming than Sony will ever offer, which is why Xbox sales continue to rise.   I don't care about consoles, but the Xbox One doesn't support 4K games either. Save up ten bucks a month starting now and you'll probably have enough for a PS4 on sale by the time this game comes out. I'm with you... sake It wasn't the game (mechanics, play) that made people love it, it was the story (combined with otherwise solid execution of the game); I think if you slap a ho-hum story onto the game's world/mechanics, the game becomes forgettable as yet another zombie/survival game I think they think that because it was a very well done game. It had a good story, well designed gameplay, good cinematics, good sound, the engine was smooth and didn't bug out all the time, etc. They basically hit every nail on the head with its design. Sure it might not be the best game ever, but in terms of design and execution you can't really ask for more. It set the bar quite high for game devs. It causes a slight divide, sure, but I wouldn't call the idea lame. Naughty Dog might be benefitting from Sony exclusivity (more support, funding, etc.), so why wouldn't they take that? then you only have to wait for 2 more days. One more day and then we can all go back to waiting for Half Life 3 I waited 10 years for Final Fantasy XV, and it was worth it for me. As long as they get TLG right, I don't mind the wait personally.  Probably a bad example... Kingdom hearts 3 -_- Been waiting for a The Legend Of Dragoon sequel for as long as I can remember 
There's dust in my bones  Uncharted 4 was amazing and they could top TLoU with part II. Seriously I will wait for however long it takes, I wouldn't want to rush the masters at work!  I really want to avoid buying a console, but Naughty Dog always delivers so I may have to get a PlayStation at some point. You can't rush great games. When ND delays their games, they have the best intentions in mind.  Sure..  but if a game doesn't come out until a new console is released..  it can't be factored in to the appeal or sales of a previous console?   And isn't that what this image is suggesting? It was an IRL 'Shut up and take my money' I dont pre-order at all any more. mostly because i never have not been able to get a copy of a game in the past few years. they've really got distribution figured out anymore, there's no point.  Everybody wants to ^(^^^figuratively)shit on this kid, but sometimes you have the money now and you know you don't have the self control to save it for a year. But if you give it to the store, it's not burning a hole in your pocket. Or you could always be [this guy.](http://iob.imgur.com/uYGg/uVcMfUSpRy) Take his money and pocket it.  That should teach him about preordering. Does he think there aren't going to be enough copies around?  And shot my dog! And raped my mother! 2relateable4me [LMFAO. Pretty much.](http://i.imgur.com/GWS2h7e.png) I dare say that Naughty Dog of today is what Rare was in its prime. But why would you preorder instead of buying the game after it has been reviewed and guaranteed to be a good purchase? and all the Uncharteds, and the original Crash Bandicoots. Naughty Dog is a trusted dev who haven't made a bad game. It isn't an exception when they are consistently great. Hypocrites, or it's a site filled with a wide variety of opinions and beliefs.  More like Naughty Dog has a solid history of making quality games and not screwing over its supporters, but to each his own, I guess. http://imgur.com/gallery/tvr8ZNU Naughty Dog has earned my trust at this point.  I haven't been disappointed by them yet.
 The pinnacle of gaming. AND THEY'RE MAKING A KNACK 2. HA. NOW WHAT YOU GONNA DO? HA You and Mark Cerny Rules are rules mate http://i.imgur.com/7HwdEOX.jpg Or Europe, or pretty much anywhere that isn't the states 19. I liked how appropriately brutal the multiplayer meta game was.

"Had a rough day?  Not as rough as your clan.  They're dead now." The multiplayer is the best multiplayer game I have ever played. They did a great job with Uncharted too, but that is fast paced like most other shooters. In the TLOU everyone actually sneaks around. I love it! The bow users make my d2 amazon look like an idiot, I swear they dont take a shot unless its at my face. The multiplayer was awesome. Revolver only team crushing all the tryhards <3 I've been addicted to Destiny since I bought it in 2014, lol. I also bought Arkham Knight when it came out and just got around to that as well. Also a pretty cool game. [deleted] Surprisingly yea! I have no idea how close I am to the end, but I thought for sure I'd have finished it by now. Everytime I think the game is over (now that I'm know there's a part II I keep expecting the game to end in a cliffhanger), the game keeps going. Some pretty crazy twist and turns plotwise. 

Also, this is the first ever 'survival' game that I've not used google to solve some puzzles for me. Heh. So that's cool - nothing is too hard to solve. I agree! I'm half-assing my job at the moment instead! 
 *pats back* Where is your Bloodborne or Uncharted 4 buddy? :( lol

:(( Have you played the foundation update?  No Man's Lie* I'll give you the $31 that I have in my wallet PS4 are worthless in reselling, at 1/4th or less the original value... good luck with that There are so many great exclusives on PS4. Do yourself a favour, trade away the multiplats, and buy the Uncharted Collection and Bloodborne.  I originally bought a PS3 to play the last of us. In my mind, I have a pretty strict difference between "Oh that looks cool, I'll watch a let's play" and "Must buy. Now."

Plus I got a sweet deal on the PS3. Ffs! I've been waiting to change my name to that!  Still better then tigerman2013 >not_bruce_wayne

>IM_BATMAANN

You are really bad at keeping your identity a secret. But then, I love Batmaann so I ain't complainin' A bit silly, but better than nothing imo.

Personally, I feel like it's there to discourage people from setting vulgar names, and then getting them reset to a randomized name. DON'T YOU EVER GIVE UP YOUR CAPRI SUN! r/holdmyjuicebox  And the rest of us are now going to go home and drink with that realization... And yet we drink anyway. Look at all these stupid kids in the ball pit! Hey..I resent that!  I'm old-as-fuck and I liked all that shit while you young'ns were in pre-school. haha As someone who owns all 3 I don't get that hate on Wii U. It's an amazing shelf warmer. (But seriously Mario cart will always be amazing) Wii U and PC are my favorite combination. I feel like I get enough exclusives and it satisfies my console itch.  ...

I haven't even hoiked mine back uo from when I moved back in September. :x Poor thing, locked in the rubbermaid container so that I don't have to hear it's suffering. There's no such thing as the best one for your money. Both have the same games (barring a few exclusives). People argue over it because they need to prove to the world that they made the "right decision." The best for their money is a pc not a console Or like me. When they announced the Xbone with all the reselling issues they backtracked on. I said I would never buy an Xbone, which my wife recorded me saying. Now I really will never own an Xbone. Blame all the Windows 7 users for that one.  Running my comcast cable through my Xbox is the best thing ever. I run a harmony and I can run from a bluray, to cable, to netflix, to streaming music, to youtube videos, all without changing inputs or controllers. It's amazing. You're talking about the Gamecube, right? I was actually a Sony guy (I still like Xbox, but I thought the PS3/4 exclusives were more interesting) but even I can't deny the Xbox controller is light years better. 

Now I have a PC and I recently got an Xbox One gamepad and MAN those triggers are nice. 

Luckily I still have a PS4 collecting dust that I can use when TLOU part 2 is released!     Well to be fair the 360 controller was awesome in everyway. I enjoy the ps4 controller now but I love having the analog stick higher Luckily, the next Forza game will likely be on W10 too. FH3 is already on the W10 store, so. Wtf? Gamecube was a wonderful console with many amazing games. The Wii is literally a gimmick in console form.  I agree completely. Nintendo knows how to make a good game even if they are never at the pinnacle of technical and processing power. This video is pretty relevant to their ability to craft good games and might interest you! https://youtu.be/2u6HTG8LuXQ Don't worry, in 3 years they will release the PS5 and XBox:Again Understanding why she doesn't die is the entire payoff of four seasons of bonding in hell Thanks, this motivates me. I'm easily scared by horror movies and games that's why I couldn't play any longer. Thank you for your answer. I really need to go back and play it again.  MY PS3 is sitting on my shelf collecting dust.

That and the FFX/FFX-2 HD collection.  I was halfway through when my buddy asked to borrow my PS3 so I never picked it back up.  I've had everything back for a year now... As long as you haven't opened it up (removed the screws on the back) you should definitely be able to get it handled since its inside a year! They just released Skyrim Special Edition. It's been remastered for current-gen consoles (Xbox One/PS4) and there are now mods that you download to your **console** from bethesda.net! It's real. It's happening. What a time to be alive! They're a Sony owned studio. I don't think you understand how damaged we have been by Team ICO. At least you'll be able to enjoy this seven year old penny arcade strip one more time:

http://imgur.com/a/AVWqq I still don't believe it will be coming out in 2 days. Just a clever roose.  Less than a day I'm pretty sure...  Well, tomorrow for me. At this point? Fuck valve we don't want it anymore. It'll come out when Valve releases a steambox (or whatever the fuck they call a computer) coupled with a VIVE for some reasonable price and be the flagship VR game.  

That's my speculation at least.  I'd honor the fuck out of this agreement. Nearly choked on a pretzel laughing at this.  Eh, there are other bonuses. Amazon is 20% new releases with Prime, Best Buy is 20% all with GCU, couple that with most major releases get $10 with preorders and extra dlc. I mean, if it's a dev you trust, has good review scores, and something you are going to buy, why not? There is if you live in rural areas where they still stock based on pre-orders as a sign of local interest. It doesn't matter everywhere anymore but in many places it still does. Or just buy digital. Granted I can understand liking hard copies but unless the bombs drop there's still gonna be plenty of electrons to go around. I preorder cause Amazon gives you 20% off The last game I had a little bit of difficulty getting on the day of release was Burning Crusade. I had to go to a 2nd target to find a copy.

Edit: It's weird how dated the idea of going to Target or Walmart or BestBuy or Gamestop to get a game feels already. I only pre-order games from Nintendo and Naughty Dog since I know that they will never release a buggy, unfinished game. For Nintendo as well, this coupled with the fact that they always does their artificial scarcity bullshit.   I preorder games from Amazon because of the 20% discount plus the convenience of having the game delivered to my door on release day. I don't want to shit on that kid. Why does everyone forget Jak & Daxter when talking about Naughty Dog? With Crash, Jak, Uncharted, and Last of Us, it's been 11 straight games that were great over the past 20 years. Uncharteds and Bandicoots are such funny words. Because things change. Maxis was also renowed for great games, and then Spore and Simcity landed. A lot of the time I see people acting as if time means nothing. Studios get judged on games that released decades ago, even if nearly nobody who worked on these game is in the studio anymore. EA is still treated like gaming Hitler despite having significantly improved in the past few years, Valve still coasts on goodwill made a decade ago, and so on and on. Strange, given how quickly the videogame industry changes in general. I'm still waiting. Bethesda...Bethesda hurt me. I was going to pre-order because I wanted to but now... but now I'm pre ordering just to spite you. And I'm going to whisper your name while I do it.  Ah yes, niche internet personalities I'm supposed to know and take advice from for some reason.

 Why is Linus there? I agree only company to get a pre-order out of Me. I prefer order there collectors edition because I'm a sucker for a good statue and naughty dog always puts out high quality statues. The nathen drake state from uncharted 4 has a place of honor on my desk. By far my favorite  Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Pre-ordering is a perfectly valid practice, it's abuse by certain companies is the problem not the medium itself. I also consider Naughty Dog one of the 'good' devs after i got The Last Of Us, Nintendo is also up there for me specifically. *Here comes the money* Ha, nice reference.

I love how dunkey changed his review of the last of us in his uncharted 4 video. Oh man, $20 says Sony made it because of people making Dunkey references that went straight over their heads.

Are we gonna see a direct sequel to Super Mario Brothers 2 soon? And those who can't follow the rules get the Iron. Shut that shit down I admittedly know very little on how to make gifs. It's pretty mental that you can legally join the army, go shoot someone, come back, run for mayor, star in a bunch of porno films and still not be considered mature enough to drink a beer tbh.  Honestly there isn't a good reason for our drinking age to be so high anymore. The original reason is that drinking age used to be state-mandated, but some states were 21 and some were 18. The issue there was that kids would drive to where it was 18, get drunk, and die driving back.  
The solution was to make drinking age a federally regulated thing, and unfortunately they decided to go with the higher age, since that would cause less of a fuss. Now there's a social stigma around underage drinking, so people are hesitant to back any sort of movement to bring the drinking age back down. No sane politician is going to back or suggest such a change, since the baby boomers are currently still the largest voting population in the states, and god forbid they piss off the elderly.  
edit:  not even gonna pretend like I remembered and just left it out for clarity; the actual way that the drinking age is enforced is that the federal government gives some highway funding to each state as long as the drinking age is over 21. No state is going to pass that money up. Thanks to /u/Maxnout100 for pointing that out. Put your Facebook info in and your mom just died because you lost a game. Shiv kills are so satisfying and so frustrating when it happens to you Yep that is what was so great about online - if you played as a team and used odd strategies you could beat a lot of highly skilled players.

Probably some of the best team multiplayer I have tried, shits all over Battlefield if you are looking for that real 'team' spirit. Yep im in the same boat dude. Got 400 on 3 guys, started batman, beat it. Now on to bloodborne, and playing BF1 also. I also still have just cause 3 in the wrapper from last year.... This is my exact story too. Played the tutorial part of it, but then went back to destiny. I'm 400 LL now though so I went back to last of us after the announcement was made Naughty dog is really, **really** good at this. This game (along with the whole Uncharted series) just feels like a gigantic movie that you play through. Cinematic details are incredible and the stories really pull you into the world. That's the spirit! *There there. They can't hurt you anymore*  Bloodborne was seriously a game that took me by surprise. I got it on sale about a month after it came out and I played it a bit with a buddy, but I never got into it so I set it aside for a while. Picked it up a few months later and couldn't put it down.  Bloodborne is amazing. Never got into the Uncharted games, but Bloodborne was the deciding factor in me getting a PS4. No... It turned me off so bad I just dont see ever going back. I have less than zero interest in it now. Sold I'll give him $32, and half of my sandwich.  try poopoobagoo420 or poopoobagoo69, those are equally good What do you mean? My user name is pretty straight forward. I am Batman but I am not, **repeat: am NOT** Bruce Wayne. I love my Wii U. Wind waker remaster, twilight princess remaster, super mario 3d world was one of the best mario games ever, mario maker is excellent, splatoon is fun, smash bros, and Mario Kart 8. 

I wish it wasn't dead and didnt have such a horrible life because it was a good console. Here's to hoping there's some "ambassador program" for the wii u on the switch as a thank you for supporting them.  For perspective. Splatoon has sold as many copies as Uncharted 4, which is currently the best-selling PS4 game. Splatoon is the _sixth_ best-selling Wii U game. 

The Wii U certainly didn't sell many machines, but a hell of a lot of people seem to want those games... For the most part it's not really a competitor in the console wars. That sounds strange because it's a console and it sells well enough, but I don't know many people that actually choose it INSTEAD of an xbox/ps/pc. They'll either buy it in addition to it, or they weren't gonna buy one of the other consoles anyway. 

Which, by the way, is exactly what Nintendo wanted.  I feel like i see this exact comment every single time i see a thread about console wars pertaining to the X1 and PS4. as a primarily PC gamer, my PS4 gets used WAY more than my wii u. the controller situation is pants on head retarded, the UI is super slow, and there's basically the usual slew of nintendo games+bayonetta. It pretty much collects dust unless I have a group of people over.  I moved back in May, it's the only thing that's still not unpacked lol.  There is such a thing as the best one for your money, after you factor in your own usage habits. Then the debate starts over whose usage habits are wrong. I like playing with friends and my friends have Xboxs, so I got an Xbox. That's what makes it the best one for my money. Not the games, not the specs, just the friends. People just like being on teams.  That's what it's really about. Playstation-Xbox Android-Apple Republican- Democrat etc etc etc  You're saying that like all consoles or even computers are inherently the same. I don't really know or care about the differences in hardware, but there certainly could be a better one for your money.  Ps4 is jrpg heaven doe. On the other hand xbox is a desert for jrpgs. This post is about an exclusive. That's the difference most of us talk about. I prefer the PS4 for Naught Dog, Bloodborne and Until Dawn.  Gamesphere* No lie, the Gamecube has one of the best controllers. Wavebird FTW! The Xbox (and formerly Dreamcast) layout is just more ergonomic.  The PS4 controller is just an updated dualshock, which itself was basically a PlayStation 1 controller with two sticks stuck onto the bottom.  The prime position on the pad is occupied by the face buttons on the right and the DPAD on the left, which since the invention of sticks has been a secondary input area at best in most genres.

On Xbox, your thumbs naturally rest on the two most important control areas in 90% of games - the left stick, which controls movement, and the face buttons which are usually attack/jump/brake/drift/dodge/block/use ability.   That's so bizarre, the Xbox one controller is exactly why I got the ps4, I think the DS4 is the best controller ever, right after the 360's that is. Aside from the problem of the rubber coming off the analogs it feels way nice, triggers feel tighter and the analog sticks have way more tactile feel to them. But that's just my opinion, as is the way of things everyone has different preferences Wasn't the D-Pad a concern, about it being a floating D-Pad or whatever? Don't WTF me. 

Go on eBay and compare prices. I am not making this up. This is beyond opinion. The GameCube didn't hold value like the other Nintendo systems.  And my pc will still be outperforming them all... Excellent description of TLOU. ... that you can fully experience in one continuous 12 hour playthrough So am I, man. But honestly, there's only one scene in this game that really got me - just so you're prepared, turn on all the lights in your house and be ready when you're in a basement at the bottom of an elevator shaft. I've played though the game 3 times now, and that scene makes my heart race every time. Pretty sure the new Fallout did this as well at least for the Xbone yeah nine years really is crazy, the game was supposed to be made for ps3 Half-Life players still have you beat by 2 years. And that is from a cliffhanger ending. I've held off buying a ps4 for this game.. Looking forward to the ps9 How about waiting for Half Life 2: Episode 3... (AKA HL3)?

 I think you're being a baby.
At least you get your game we Half Life fans are never getting Half Life 3.

We were promised a few month wait. Let's just hope the game lives to the hype, which it probably won't.  Everybody was saying that though. It was probably back to the drawing board to find a way to subvert the trope and it just took this long.  Sometimes I wonder if the Halflife style still would translate or if the hypetrain would derail it like Duke Nukem Forever Lets hope that if they make HL3 they would round up the story. This whole thing has been a joke.   [deleted] Maybe reverse psychology will work! That's good, because we're not getting it. More money in putting community skins into CS:GO and making tons of money for practically no work at all. You mean you don't want it. I still want it! Plus if you don't do the whole midnight release thing, Amazon will send the game to your mailbox the day of release.

Your first chance to play is typically after work anyway. Or if the game is a pokemon game. Shit goes out of stock so fast €69.99 on PSN, €59.90 for a physical copy. Easy choice. The only problem with digital is downloading the thing. For a large game on a shitty network (origin, steam and blizzard apparently have amazing speeds compared to Sony and Microsoft) or your own capped or just plain slow broadband you could buy it and not get to play it until the next day.  Digital is a horrible way to go. You don't own the game, you have a license and if you account goes so do all the games you "own". The PlayStation store has horrible prices. The games have no resale value. You can't buy used. You can't easily lend it to a friend. If you have to uninstall it, reinstalling it to play again is slow. 


Literally the only advantage is you can be even more lazy and don't have to put the disk in. 


Like sure, digital off Steam when things are on crazy sales. That digital is good. Buying full priced games new or even like 2 years later off the console stores is a ripoff.  Damn, I remember the days where you'd see physical copies of vanilla WoW on the shelves at Best Buy. How the times have changed... What if he's into it for me it's cause I never got round to Jak and Daxter but I have heard nothing but praise for them so include them too Iove how with Jak and Daxter, they're like "no we gotta have to *want* to make this. Can't be a cash grab."

Then they remaster Crash Bandicoot.  Yeah and I admit things can go wrong and that's why when a dev I trust releases a bad game I don't pre order from that point (Bethesda comes to mind after fallout 4). It's about finding a balance I don't pre order every game in existence, I pre order the games I want from devs I trust and at the minute that list of devs has gotten short in fact currently it consists of:

Rockstar
Naughty Dog
Nintendo

They are the only devs I'll pre order a game from currently.

Also you're right about EA everyone gets on like they are hitler but EA gave games like Mirrors Edge and Brutal Legend a chance when others wouldn't. Man, I wish he had a better username to whisper.  I'd love to read the police report about the guy at Gamestop who got arrested because he kept repeating "/u/analcuntdestroyer420". Watch out, we got a badass over here. Preordering badass.

 It's not like it's a baseless claim. No mans sky, most recently has shown us that pre ordering is usually a bad idea especially in todays age. Still pointless to pre-order 

also, enabling of shitty companies by enabling the practice I don't ever wanna have to do that again.  And those who can't follow the rules get the ~~Iron~~ hose again. Mark's face looked like grilled cheese in a skillet. Plus passing out and pissing himself! It rubs Lucile on its skin, or it gets the iron again Actually it's not "federally mandated" but it might as well be. You see this one government official (I forget her name) passed some law that offers highway funds IF your state as the age at 21. So until we invent teleportation or repeal that law, no one in gonna give up those highway funds  A few years ago my then-girlfriend died from dysentery. My mother was considering cannibalism. Great times.   BUT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE DAWNING? AHHHHH IT SOUNDS SO AMAZING. Strike scoring! Ice breaker! Kiosks for Ornaments!!!

... And all my Destiny BFFs are sick of Destiny now :(  I had a similar experience with Dark Souls 1. Played the beginning with a buddy and got rekt by the early enemies. Got discouraged to play more and stopped playing for 6 months. I picked it up again, got rekt but I decided to push through the early game. Fell in love with the series after that. Thus will spell the continued end of NMS. But you're not... Needs more X's and underscores. Judging by the demographic online I can safely say those names will be taken as well inb4 those are taken poo69bagoo420xxx   youre like a literal legend after that I hope the prices go down when the switch is released so I can grab one.  Probably because X1 and PS4 are both PC-like while Nintendo brings something new to the table, along with a slew of Nintendo exclusives.  Eh, PS4 was cool but it didn't make sense for me if most of the stuff I like is on PC anyway. Seems like I get more of a different experience out of owning a Wii U whereas with a PC/PS4 combo I'm repeating a lot. 

I guess if you're super into gaming then yeah grab every console imaginable. I can't imagine having the time or desire to be that wrapped up into it though.  There is also the cognitive dissonance of people who have invested way too much money in it and then trying to defend it tooth and nails (looking at you Apple fanboys) Look at Mr. Fatcat over here with his 'friends'.  I got one for the same reasons, and an still gutted with all the PlayStation exclusives that I desperately want to play (mainly uncharted games and street fighter). yea but android and apple can still call and message each other. Dem and Republican can still work together to make laws.

Playstation v xbox is the one situation where youre literally cutting off the other side. You cant play with them and you cant talk to them 

This isn't just best for the money. Youre literally choosing a team and hoping more people choose your team. Because the team with more people get better games. THAT DRESS WAS BLACK AND BLUE I guess it's important to be a Wii U/PC loving, Windows phone using independent then. That's his point, by realistic measurements the only meaningful difference is the availability of exclusive games or various niche features.  

So if I hardly ever game I might have an Xbox One, that doesn't make it better because my lifestyle seems to align with a side feature. I just want to point out your straw man argument there. Comparing two same generation consoles is not the same as comparing two random computers. New computers have a tremendous range. Maybe two top of the line computers released at the same time, but certainly not "computers are inherently the same.". That wasn't what he/she said at all.

 #IT'S SPHERICAL  My pointer fingers would like a word with you.  > On Xbox, your thumbs naturally rest on the two most important control areas in 90% of games - the left stick, which controls movement, and the face buttons which are usually attack/jump/brake/drift/dodge/block/use ability.

Maybe for you, but for me and plenty of others, the PS4 controller feels *way* better on our hands. Oh I didn't realize you were talking literal dollar value haha. Well if FFXV is an example the wait will be worht it. 9 years. Cute.

Tell us Tool fans about waiting... I've waited across almost 10 years and two console generations for FF XV (since back when it was called FF vs XIII) and now that it's finally coming out, I'm too broke to afford to buy it The worst part is that with the portal series they sort of added tiny snippets of seeds of hope into the potential HL3 game. Shenmue player here. How you doin. Buy it for Bloodborne You should buy it for Bloodborne. Bloodboooorne  Buy it for bloodborne  "How do we subvert the trope, but then also have a suitably emotional ending?"

7 years later...

"They both die!" Half-Life Forever confirmed!  I think it would but not necessarily in the way we are used to. Gabe made a comment once about how Valve views their IP as tools in a toolbox to show off other things. I think that's exactly why we haven't had HF3. As great as it would have been it, there is no new technologies or mediums that it could showcase, other than the standard better graphics. 

I think if and when we do see it, it will be to showcase some new generation defining technology - like the first Source engine defined and created so many games for 10 years plus. Maybe that will be VR, maybe it will be something else. The chances are that the hype has lived on for too long and everyone will sort of expect a Duke Nukem Forever. At least that is my view on it. I will get hopeful in the first days of an official statement about a new HL game. However they will fade and become bitter cynicism as I patiently await the GAME worth waiting for. I'm fairly convinced they just wrote themselves into a corner and didn't feel like finishing the story.  Toys "R" Us is a great place for this. I used to work in the electronics department there and the only game we ever ran out of for the three years I worked there was Super Smash Brothers 3DS. Never ran out of a Pokemon game nor Destiny at release (were were the only store in the city and it's surrounding towns that didn't). Same with Battlefront and Arkham Knight. No one thinks of Toys "R" Us for games, so they usually maintain stock pretty well. Most redditors don't seem to get this.  Not everyone has google fiber or equivalent.  I remember having to wait two days just to download a patch for destiny.   [deleted] Both have pros and cons. Disks can get lost or damaged, they take up physical space, they still need to download patches and stuff. 

The only thing that annoys me is that digital costs as much as a physical disk with manufacturing, packaging, storage and transportation costs.

But as for the practicality... eh, to each their own. > Literally the only advantage is you can be even more lazy and don't have to put the disk in.

[I beg to differ.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PG161lwbfP4/hqdefault.jpg) The problem comes from the games pricing for consoles rather than the concept behind digital itself. Microsoft and Sony sell games at pretty absurd prices in their store, even years after their release. With Steam, Humble Bundle, GoG, etc, on PC, there's a lot of competition which helps to drive prices down.

Also, don't fool yourself, even if you have a hard copy of a game, you don't "own" it otherwise you could modify the files, make copies, etc. This is all illegal since you don't "own" the game. And like somebody else said, with online DRM becoming more and more present, physical copies are losing a lot of their appeal. What if *I'm* into it? yeah Naughty Dog have nothing to do with the crash remaster outside of making the originals. They don't do anything that they don't want to do, and don't do cash grabs.  This is Activision developed by Vicarious Visions. Naughty Dog has nothing to do with it. It's been 20 years. It's possible there are very few people at Naughty Dog currently who worked on Crash originally. Maybe it's a cool new project for most of them.  That iron just got 50% hotter. I'd rather the hose than those jumper cables I keep hearing about. /r/nocontext  That's rough, buddy. xXxP00_P00_Ma_XxX_G00xXx I haven't had a console in years but bloodborne really makes me sad =( PS4 is pc-like but still brings plenty of its own Pros to the table. Which is why I have a PS4, PC, and WiiU. I bought my MacBook back in 2010. It's still running strong and it has served every use I have needed it to. Whats the problem? Disgusting. He probably even has girl friends.  Right, or if you like Japanese games you might go for the PS4 because it tends to have more.

There are certainly valid reasons to do so, but I tend to agree that neither is inherently better than the other. > You're saying that like all consoles ~~or even computers~~ are inherently the same. I don't really know or care about the differences in hardware, but there certainly could be a better one for your money.

If that is better that's fine. I stand by it. Just like the Wii was not nearly as powerful as the PS3 or 360 it is not inconceivable that one of the 'big two' couldn't have better hardware than the other.  Are you saying it with Emphasis? **EMPHASIS!** *chkinngg* Mr. Nukem would like a word with you. I've been exceptionally pleased with FFXV. It really is a Final Fantasy for Fans and First-Timers. I WANT TO RIDE MY CHOCOBO ALL DAY So far, XV hasn't had anything outrageously broken for being in development for 10 years.  That's usually not the case. Look at Duke Nukem or Gran Turismo 5.  I mean, people have enjoyed it quite a bit, but XV doesn't seem to be like "the FF to end all FF's." 10 years is a long time.  Hey bro we have to wait 10.000 days in total. So we only have about 2/3 to go Beatles fan here, still waiting... if they do it, It will have to be a crossover....Half-portal 6 or portal life 2 episode 2 episode 1
 And Uncharted 4. Bloodborne can buy his own PS4. [deleted] The world's first open world, sandbox FPSMMO...with hats! Too bad the only close Toys 'R' Us near me turned into a Babies 'R' Us.

I still don't understand it, but I guess my area must have a shit ton of couples with nothing better to do I see this in my local mall as well. The EB Games can be out of a game entirely, but go one level up to the Toys R Us and the shelves are full. TRU can be a hidden gem for finding games. Back in the old days, Sears was the secret video game store. I just walked in and bought a PS2 there a couple of weeks after launch even as people were lining up in the early morning hours at Best Buy or EB Games hoping they'd get a shipment.  This advice applies to the Microsoft Store too (at least in my mall). I preordered Forza Horizon 3 Ultimate Edition three days before it came out. Best Buy was out and Game Stop was out. Microsoft Store had stock left to pre-order and basically told me "Everyone forgets we sell Xbox games so we always have everything in stock" >  you need online DRM to play though

Not on console - online passes were dumped a few years ago. 

 The Crash remaster isn't Naughty Dog though. Hasn't been since  CTR in 1999 Did you eat the iron's pussy like a lady? RIP in piece u/rogersimon10 bloodborne was a $460 game for me. worth it.
 [deleted] > I bought my MacBook back in 2010

I dont think you qualify as a fanboy Not that, people who only use apple products and get triggerd by seeing other phones/computers. Also it's not the products that he is bashing it's the above stereotype. My 2010 MacBook feel off the counter last week...:(. Gonna try and get it repaired. See if I can crank out a few more years. No problems before its high dive.  Yeah I feel like it mainly comes down to what exclusives someone prefers and what console the majority of their friends have. I've always mainly gone Xbox because of Halo and because everyone I know has one.  Cmon now, this is Team Ico. They have two masterpieces and NOTHING ELSE. 

First time for everything, lets hope it's not for the Last Guardian.  Half Life 3. I probably won't see it before I die and I'm only 23 and in perfect health.  Doom Guy showed Mr. Nukem how to git gud while waiting. Is that word bubblegum? Thats why I used FFXV (and I secretly liked the part of Forever that I've played ^^^sssshhhhhh) I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and i'm all out of gum! <3 Prompto and his love for Chocobo's. Iwant to know if those have ever been lyrics for it or if he just made up his own lyrics to [this song](https://youtu.be/BaMIg_q4LeY) He sings that so often it refuses to leave my head as well. God...dammit. I literally just got this out of my head... I agree with you about Duke Nukem, but what was wrong with GT5? (I joined in just before update 2.0, by the way. No launch experience) What's wrong with GT5?  Fuck don't say that... i used to post on another band's message board when 10,000 Days came out, some of the "regulars" were fucking adament that the 10,000 Days that was released wasn't the real thing and it was just a big wind up by Tool.

Every year they'd post about how they're still waiting for the real 10,000 Days.

/nostalgia Mega man legends fan here... All I can do is cry  At least it's not Kingdom Hearts 2.9 Final HD Re-Mix: The Final Pre-Sequel Chapter X: This Time It's Personal. And The Last Of Us: Part 2

I'm a PC gamer (with a 10 year old PS3) but the announcement of TLoU2 is *really* making me want to buy a PS4Pro. Also want to experience Bloodborne, Uncharted 4 and TLOU:Remastered. Until Dawn is a solid game for about 6-8 hours, with a good story and that's about it. Not sure why you think it would move units. One word friend. Planetside 2! Babies "R" Us do better with credit card apps and surprisingly have less theft problems so if a store really suffers there, it's not uncommon for them to change, especially if there's one less than 50 miles away from it. > I guess my area must have a shit ton of couples with nothing better to do

Are you suggesting there is something better to be doing other than making sweet, sweet.... babies? Your local mall has an EB games AND a toys r us? Holy shit  I remember a calamity a few years ago when they had has the 3DS XL mislisted as on sale for $60 and everyone went to us and Best Buy to price match. That was the first time I realized Sears even sold video games. im just fucking with you, irons dont have pussies  This has not been my experience. I have never seen an Apple user shitting on PC's like my friends did on my MacBook Pro in high school. And to be clear, I now have an Acer laptop, and a gaming PC that I built myself. lol I don't even remember the last time I saw a rabid Apple fan shitting on PC in any popular sub. More often than not people assume there's aforementioned fans every time Apples name comes up and comments as if they're outspoken truthers who know better. 

The PC/Andriod fans have become what they view Apple fans. It's toxic nonsense that Reddit needs to get over.  totally agreed there.  I really hope it turns out as great as the other two.  There's a part of me that's really worried when I see gameplay, though.  something just feels slightly... off.  hopefully it clicks more once it's in hand. Duke Nukem 3D was also a masterpiece of its time. Well, IGN just [gave it a 7.0](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review) I would like a statement from your doctor confirming this. By the time that game comes out I'll hear about it from my great-great-great-great-grandchild in the afterlife. I'll be sure to kick his/her butt if they don't fucking bring me a copy! I understand it's a joke now, but has Valve ever mentioned they were working on a Half Life 3 or had plans to?  It feels pretty obvious to me they're done.  At this point it's just going to have idiots going "omg <alien x> on <level y> gets stuck in a wall, what the fuck Valve I waited so long and this is what you give me".  They're better off sticking to Steam and hardware now. I think half life 3 is lose lose for valve. It could be the greatest game ever made and would never live up to its hype. So why bother make something that is guaranteed to disappoint. Half Life 3 confirmed! Doom guy doesnt give a crap about our opinions idspispopd what you did there. Dear Bethesda,

Please buy Team ICO and the part of Valve that owns Half-Life and Portal. 

...yknow, an open world game set in the Black Mesa/Aperture Science world isn't what I am expecting, but it could be good. I suppose the danger is it might feel too much like Fallout. I just bought that this weekend and I'm 100% in love with it. So much circle strafing. I missed games like this. The Serious Sam games and Painkiller scratched that itch for a long time.  No, he's all out of that yeah, i'm just being facetious.  I sure hope you're right!  what a wait it's been. he is *INTO* chocobos Launch day was sort of... meh. It wasn't boring or completely broken (atleast for me), but the game seemed like there were things missing. One of my favorite parts was the photo mode. A big disappointment about it though was that not all cars would be available in photo mode (c'mon Bugatti) and you couldn't check out the interior. I think the update fixed a lot of things though.   I guess I was expecting more from GT5. On launch day, besides the >10GB day one patch, it felt like the game was missing a lot. At least for me. The Photo Mode was one of my favorite parts of the game, but not all a cars were available in photo mode. And you could physically tell which cars those were. The drop in quality from a photo mode car and a non-photo mode one was shocking (c'mon Bugatti). I haven't played it since the 2.0 patch so my experience was from release day. I guess my cousin hyped up the game for me too much and I expected the racing game to end all racing games.  You forgot the "Now with more outfits!" Yeah but I'm going to buy that either way. Damn you Nomura!! Is Planetside 2 still going?

My wife and I had a blast playing it when it first came out - we'd generally run around as a squad of 2 either in a Sunderer or a bike and plant mines on undefended enemy Sunderers until the player base complained that undefended forward spawn points were too easy to kill and fitting mine guard was too hard apparently so Sony nerfed mines into the ground. 

It was a shame. 

Apparently telling people to shoot the guys coming to attack the bus was not a viable tactic.  upvote...PS2 is the only FPSMMO I work around a ton of people who are pro Apple, but it's mostly just phones. Although, I've seen that start to drop off over the last few years. I think linear is the word you're looking for. Tight corridors and bridges is where a lot of the footage takes place. My hope is that the AI will feel real enough so that the world feels organic regardless of your predetermined path. I haven't looked at stuff in a few months because I don't have a ps4, but when I did the movement really bothered me. Walking and running just looks like it would feel awful. [deleted] I think that's partly ICO's style. When I watched footage of Shadow of the Colossus for the first time, I thought it looked boring, but it turned out to be one of my favourite games. There is something about their style that has to be experienced rather than watched.  "Shake it baby"

space bar

"Shake it baby"

space bar

Mom comes in the room

"... shit shit shit shit shit alt tab alt tab alt tab"

"You still beating up the bad guys hun?"

"Yep sure am. Mmm hmm. Beating them up real good" That game is friggin awesome. 

Hell, I still play it using Yang.  I'll make my own opinions on it. I understand the skepticism, though. 


Why is it always the games that go through development hell that seem to fall short? I hope I disagree with them.  I'm his doctor, can confirm, he will die before Half life 3 is released Hi I am the doctor. Just let me get my gloves. Extraordinary health! ~~Probably~~ The healthiest individual ever to die before Half life 3 is released. Gabe? IDk what you're on about.  Half Life 3 confirmed to run on Gamebryo I'm thinking of getting the new Doom since I loved all the other ones (even 3)

One thing though, are you limited to only a few weapons at a time like in most other FPS games or can you carry a shit ton of guns and ammo like in the old Doom games? How about you go eat shit and die! It did fix a lot of things- GT5 probably has the second most hours played on my ps3, right behind borderlands. I still boot up GT5 now and then, it has much more polish than GT6  What about the other one? Starts with a D, has a stripper name?  Dude was just straight up ready to accept certain death What were those two guys doing that just come popping up from behind the counter...? After seeing so many people run into walls and falling over while using VR headsets, I really start think they should make VR helmets rather than VR headsets.  Damn I really want to try VR I can't wait for a VR climbing simulator where once you're high enough, the likelihood of your hand or foothold breaking away increases. That would really fuck with people [What the...](https://gfycat.com/SelfassuredDistantBear) This seems dangerous. This would never happen playing virtual virtual skeeball. Once had my sister try Job Simulator on the HTC Vive. She dropped the ketchup bottle behind the mini-mart counter and went to look for it on the other side. She attempted to lean on the counter while doing so. Thank the laawwd they build them contraptions sturdy.
 Please don't drink and virtual drive.  Be responsible. This must be why it's so hard to find in-store demos of VR. For people who don't know, this is "The Climb" by Crytek, played on the Rift with their new VR controllers "Touch" (which releases on Dec 6th)

EDIT: sry meant Crytek not Ubisoft Seriously though, VR is awesome and experiencing it is completely different from just seeing it. If you get the chance to use a demo, do it, we all need this to catch on for the advancement of the technology. It's very easy to become disoriented in VR. I was playing the desk demo and was crouching down to plug shit in and when I went to stand up I tried to use the VR desk to balance myself...I almost fell into a fireplace...so, be safe kids! Looks the the vive out performs the rift even at this: http://imgur.com/a/XNbOr [Someone who is a "little bit" scared of heights trying VR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX-FpMARbvs) [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUnHehfPZS0) Full immersion, just how I like it. Anyone else wonder if I n 100 years clips like this will be interspersed with the movie theatre full of people ducking behind chairs as the in screen train comes toward them? The calibration screen for the Rift DK2 is a little room with a table that has a flower and lamp on it. I jokingly tell everyone that the effect is so convincing that you end up trying to grab the stuff on the desk and just flail your arms around like an idiot.

I laugh, they laugh, they put on the headset, and grab at the flower or lamp like an idiot in no time flat.

It's shocking how convincing the effect is, even with low-res dev versions. Microsoft VR: So immersive, it'll make you look fucking retarded. I always thought these videos were bullshit... then I got an Oculus Rift from my girlfriend for our anniversary.  Then I played Minecraft on it... then I was attacked by a creeper, and I almost fell attempting to not have my beautiful village that I took a long time making from having bits of it blown up...

I no longer think any of these videos are bullshit. I love how he looks down and then his legs start to buckle like is suddenly terrified of heights while standing on the ground. Then flop. 10/10 And you reposted it Someone needs to do this with a drilling rig. Derrick hand style. That would be sweet  I could see a Dr.Strange VR game being a hit. I actually tried this game in this same location (I actually met the girl who comes in at the end, that's what caught my attention). When you get into that game it's insane. The vertigo and the adrenaline kick in whole-hog and you get really anxious. I managed to speed my way through it and they told me I got further than anyone they'd seen try it. I felt proud.

P.S. They were constantly telling people "don't try to hold that it's just a checkpoint" and I thought it was weird. Now I know why they were doing that i guess. Everyone calling him retarded. Meanwhile those same people were totally leaning right and left when they first played a racing game. Also the same people that pulled a braced face when falling from great height in a videogame. 

But yes, because you haven't played this yourself yet, it's still retarded. Because you know, let's not start thinking about how we might react ourselves and let's definitely not take a look at past experiences. 

Good call guys.  This has been posted no less than 10 times in the last couple months. And this is why you should never do vertical movement in a VR game. Nice dab While it's a vertical video, it doesn't detract from the focus of the video... More importantly, the camera person did a wonderful job staying on the subject. Normally we get a sudden "pan down" at the moment of impact. His legs were shaking visibly moments before he fell. It almost looks like fear of height would paralyze him. I feel bad for the guy, I think I might react the same way if I tried it for the first time.  Apparently this game (The Climb) used to have to fall allllllll the way down to the bottom when you fell. They added the immediate fade to black because it freaked people out too much and most people were ending up like this dude. There should be a subreddit for these.  Given that he was wearing cargo shorts, this was bound to happen. We all laughed at Morpheus when he said it, but, "Your mind makes it real." Once again, Windows 10 letting people down.  It was funnier the first two times it was posted here... Every time I see this I will do 2 of 2 things...

Laugh and upvote, in no particular order of course. Can't wait until all the compilation videos come out after Christmas. George Takei posting on reddit now? These will be needed due to liability:
http://www.virtualrealitytimes.com/2015/04/09/list-of-omnidirectional-treadmills-under-development/ I will only try this inside the simulation. Like, doing a simulation of you doing a simulation of you climbing. That way, if you fall, you would only fall to the floor in the first simulation and you are safe in real life eating pizza. Lmaooo wow, this thing is dangerous Hahahaa I've never laughed so hard in my life.  Awwww I wish I hadn't watched this I feel so bad for him, I literally had the same reaction as the employee!!!!! Playing Minecraft with the Vive for the first time left me creeping bit by bit to the edge of any block overlooking a cliff or even a single block drop.  It's so incredibly immersive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2sCJpR3x8o Omg ... Is the sign okay? /r/bettereveryloop "your mind makes it real...the body cannot survive without the mind" Lmao  For that split second before hitting the floor, I kinda hope that dude was thinking "this feels so REAL!" As many of these I've seen now I am positive I will never ever do VR in public.  I would be the next video laughing stock. Damn how much is Microsoft paying reddit to promote this thing? Did they pay the two guys behind the counter to blow each other? So many questions... At least he didn't hit that glass display with his forehead. Whoever set this up overestimates people and apparently hasnt seen the dozens of similar videos online.  It's like using VR without training is as dangerous as using a turkey fryer without reading the directions. Ive never had the pleasure of trying VR yet.  

Can someone tell me if you ever have to move physically or could you sit in a chair and use controllers for everyrthing? Did he just fall to make it dramatic? Did his brain think "it looks like we're falling! Better act like it too!" at what point did he realize the virtual experience was over?
 ...And r/gaming fell for the repost. I can't help but laugh every time someone reposts this #repost Nice repost  Is there a subreddit just for people failing at VR? fuck whoever reposted this shit repost mania is running wild on /r/gaming Nice repost. Downvoted.  When the VR experience is too real... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnaUagfytIw Holy repost Batman! I wish I could get that taken into the games.  Oh wow, my morning is much brighter. Got a  good couple minutes of laughter. You how they say if you have a falling dream, you would actually die if you ever hit the ground? does this video prove that theory wrong? Such repost. You should be ashamed of yourself. [This is my death now.](http://refriedmemes.com/refried.html?m=ekhhr.dlrwxq.wju/MkbzyfrGfzxukvdHxhmim) Annnnd, I'm dead.  I cant believe nobody posted this one. 

http://m.imgur.com/a/XNbOr  Me too, thanks  "Uh..just taking inventory....yeah, that'll work." Guy 1 - "We need to fix some wires..."

Guy 2 - "Yea, wires..." "Experiencing virtual reality" Makes you wonder a bit :) http://i.imgur.com/1eWKYCq.gifv "My what a lovely tea party" They're just two guys and they're having a good time. Thank you. That's the best part  when you fall in the game, you fall in real life ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Well....you know how a farmer milks a cow? Great! These guys were probably just sitting at there desks. Very low desks. The fact they were blowing each other is whats a bit troubling.  They were probably trying to stay out of the camera shot.   testing surface pens... Or it's a staged video, and they're all in on it.

This is what a commercial on Reddit looks like. (Vive owner)you really have to baby sit people on their first go, drill into them the whole dont walk outside of the walls, jump , watch the cord for them. its a fun social thing for me but the owner has that extra stress of being the guardian. Good news only had one person fall, bad news was it was grandma. So, in my experiance demoing VR from the DK1 to the Vive, 50% of people can stand up on a rollercoaster no problem and go 'oh, this is really cool' the entire time.

The other 50% I had to hold up by their armpits as they flailed about freaking out about the experiance. These are the fun ones. Dying while wearing a VR set is going to be the next thing. People will be falling and hitting their heads. Or maybe... Simply give them chairs? I'd almost think that open stage VR demos won't be around that much longer at stores for concern of getting sued.   Maybe they make customers sign a waiver before trying it on? You mean like this? https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/10/cd/7e/10cd7e28d5f72256e46ba63fc22597fe.jpg I feel like they should advertise the Virtuix Omni a bit more.  Some people are just really dumb when it comes to spacial awareness. 

As a Vive owner who demos to a lot of people, I can usually tell who is going to be a clumsy idiot, and I sit them in a chair until I think they can handle it.  Or a VR cage  Do you ever get PMed small boobs?  [deleted] Take some disinfectant wipes with you. I tried it for the first time at the Microsoft store and had pink eye a couple days later. 

[Also, this. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/dailydot.relaymedia.com/amp/debug/vr-ocular-herpes/?client=safari)  But mine was only pink eye, I swear.

Edit: Apparently eye herpes was debunked. Also, my pink eye possibly unrelated, though nobody around me had it and it's my first time since I can remember. The point is to be cautious though, because pink eye is HIGHLY contagious.  There are tons of places for you to try it out.  Hell you could probably head over to /r/vive and post that you want to try it and someone nearby you would chime in and ask you to come over and bring a couple beers.  Or you could find the nearest microsoft store.  As long as you aren't in bumfuck you'll probably do alright.  Gamestops are demoing them now, too, and I believe a bunch of best buys are demoing Rifts. Microsoft stores at my malls have demos Also, your arm gets stuck under a rock and you have to cut it off It kind of does this. In the normal game, your hands get covered in cracks and blood before too long, and if you hold onto any grip with one hand for too long, you'll lose the grip and fall. This is based on a 'stamina' meter that gets shorter and shorter and you have to stop to re-chalk your hands from time to time to make the meter last longer again. It also uses the analog triggers to where if you press them just halfway down, gripping has little to no effect on your stamina, but pressing them down completely simulates too tight a grip and stamina is pretty short. It's tougher than it sounds. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb played with the XB1 elite controller that locks the triggers at the halfway point and said he never lost stamina and didn't have to chalk once by doing that. It sounded a bit gimmicky to me, but the visual and audio effects they use to give it a sense of stress make it feel really tense and cool, giving kind of the effect I think you have in mind. 

There's also a free play mode where all this is turned off and that's probably what they're using on all of the demos.  This game has breakaway holds  in climbey, a climbing game already out with full motion controls. My experience is that my irl arm and hands gets sore, add the shaking from adrenaline i have trouble holding down the grip button on the controller. Wonder what they where doing under the desk.  ;) Lmao beautifully done, dude In the full vid they drop right back down haha **!** Put brazzers over the Microsoft sign  Wow! It's just like I'm playing virtual skeeball! but I want to play VR Duck Hunt Virtual virtual skeeball is far more fun than virtual skeeball I tried VR for the first time last week. I nearly did the same thing. I went to lean over the counter and had to remind myself that it was not there. I was about half a second from shifting my weight onto it and toppling over.  I'm glad I got good wrist straps for the Vive. When playing Job Simulator, it's just too easy to want to set the controllers on the virtual counter when you're done.

In the Budget Cuts demo (which everyone *must* play), plenty of people try to lean on walls to hide from robots in the heat of the moment, only to find that those aren't real walls... Nearly did the same exact thing during the thanksgiving break where I got to try it for the first time.  "Don't drink and Vive" This is something I would do. If I could have the vr, wheel, and gas pedal to make it feel real. I wouldn't ever drink and drive irl, but I would do it on a game just to get the most realistic simulation that I can of how bad I would be at it.  Plus the headset would be so gross after a day or two. How do you mix up Crytek with Ubisoft? It's like mixing up a Ferrari and a Fiat Panda. It's by crytek I feel like the people who don't know would benefit more from this information than the people that do  VR Crysis 🔥🌡️😍 Is that an Xbox they're playing on? amen.  it's so surreal and feels like experiencing history.  what happened here? why would he jump like that? It is not that intense  A møøse once bit my sister. Except he knows he's playing a game... and has no arms... Do you think it's worth the money to buy one? Maybe you should have been sitting down? welcome to the internet. PM (personal message) me if you have any questions

 Sharing other people's content. What a crime. [Get 'em!!!](http://i.imgur.com/W1f3RzK.gifv) I'm all for it. And it wouldn't even show up on a drug test. Especially with leap motion. it's like it's begging to be made into a game with hand tracking. Let's go for 20.  I completely disagree.  Putting drunk friends in Windlands might be the best thing to do in VR.  https://www.reddit.com/r/VRFail/

Not tons of content there, but some good stuff :) Thanks ,good idea. Nicely done, m'eme  Uhh he was just showing me his files Swallowing a load "And...uh...I was giving him inventory...yeah." *Guy 3 unbuttoning pants* Probably sitting in chairs at a double counter desk. Like the ones they always have in places like this.

 Indeed Guy number 1 and I love to dance. Fancy footwork putting you in a trance. Your mind makes it real.  Always upvote Lenny Especially if they were actually blowing each other as opposed to one blowing the other.  Instead of 69, would that be an 11? So kneeling behind the counter instead of moving 4 feet to either side? Pen-15 Dude I am pretty cynical but that guy totally faceplates and didn't try to catch himself. Either he's a world class actor or he got disoriented and took a faceplant. Give it a rest.  Worked on me, I didn't know the Microsoft Store had VR demos but I'm heading to the mall tomorrow and now I wanna stop by /r/nothingeverhappens 

Commercials on reddit probably happen, but since you could say this about literally everything on /r/gaming, litterally everything on here features a commercial product, that's what the subreddit is for. it's kind of moot to even think about.  It's also how real events happen.  I doubt the guy wearing the VR was in on it.  Look at his arms the whole way down: they don't brace.  Go take your lithium If this is staged, that guy is the best stuntman I have ever seen in my entire life. I know scepticism but dude, calm down. Could also be both. Set up a camera, wait for the inevitable funny thing to happen organically, load it online, hope that the publicity helps offset the inevitable trip and fall lawsuit. Ok Sherlock, how'd you come up with this? My dad pulled a Ronnie O'Sullivan, within an hour of having it set up he tries to lean on the table in Pool Nation and fell into the wall, put a dent in the wall and cut his nose.  I literally didn't even care about the headset, I was too busy laughing my ass off, had to actually go out the back garden I thought I was going to die of laughter.  Turned out the headset was fine just a bit scraped on the top/front. My main vive setup is in a loft area with a 15' long banister that overlooks my living room.  I won't demo up there.  I lug everything downstairs for that.  I have confidence in myself to not go over the railing even if I turn my chaperone off (rarely), but I've seen too much dumb shit to let someone else try it. lol grandma you are such a stupid fucking clutz Yes, you need a "sitter", much like you would with a heavily psychoactive drug. I am honored to meet The Guardian. sooooo its like being the sober one when your friends do shrooms for the first time That and educate them not to fuck with others using VR. I was playing raw data on my vive and my wife snuck up on me pre-game and I nearly punched her in the face out of pure fright. It's crazy how immersion vr can get Is the other 50% the same people who try to drive in Mario Kart by steering the controller and moving their body left and right? So if you die in vr world you die in real life? Whoa Getting strangled by the hdmi/usb cable, at least until wireless becomes common. http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5686/22/original/640.jpg

Pfff, stop being reasonable this^ is obviously a better solution. Seeing as how the Rift and this game were made as sit down experiences, yeah it was pretty stupid of them to not give him one.  Especially for first time VR users, it can be kind of disorienting. and have game character sit on wheelchair? They do. I signed a waiver for the Vive and it was 18+ only. I do every now and then, but most of the time I get joke PMs of birds, ~~Josh and Drake~~ Drake and Josh Etc. Oh dear
 Ocular herpes was debunked: http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/26/13420318/virtual-reality-headset-ocular-herpes-health-scare They definitely sanitized it all before I used it. Did you see them doing that for you? Not saying it didn't happen to you, but that's likely very much unrelated. People have been sharing HMDs and helmets, goggles and glasses since forever without any significant occurrences of "pink eye transmission". Even if you were to smush your eyeballs on the headset... It's just not happening. 

There were reports of people which turned out to be fake or something else, but unless you are somehow extremely prone to infections, wearing VR headsets isn't going to give you anything.

Doesn't mean you shouldn't clean the headset before use, but irrational fear mongering is on the rise once again. Future tech giving eye diseases? I expect Snow Crash or something but not that.  

Edit: Yeah, pretty sure your article screenshot has been debunked by whoever got it, a burst vessel if I remember correctly.  When VR has a higher framerate than your website, you're doing something wrong. VRTD's Omg, stfu.  Id say its more probable that you didn't wash your hands and rubbed your eye than caught the infection from a demo rift. I mean, they could be anywhere on the globe. Dunno how widespread Gamestop is but maybe it's not as easy for them.

Now that I read your comment I really wonder how hard it would be to try it out here in Berlin. brb I have a buddy with the vive and the room sensors, trying to bug him into getting the 360 treadmill I just got myself a psvr and am looking for friends to come try it! There's a store in the mall closest to me that is basically a VR arcade. You pay Like 5 bucks and get to play for 15 minutes. I haven't ever gotten around to doing it though. PTSD Simulator is my favorite! Would you have them virtually masturbate as well? "Please, use that *virtual* swiss army knife..." I've played it, fun game but you only get a little over 5 days of gameplay out of it I mean I find that cool and all but like the whole thing with virtual reality and motion controls I feel is to feel like you there and doing it yourself. As an experienced climber I have to say I wish it was this easy, my point being that virtual reality is wasted on put your arms in the air simulators like this.  Praying for customers. Touching their computers  Not 'what', but 'who'. [Wow!](http://i.imgur.com/RgNF7yB.gifv) It's just like [I'm playing virtual skeeball!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eRqMiAxQ0)
 and i want to be the duck.  https://youtu.be/XWTSgV5YQSg I've had the opposite experience. Played pool nation VR for like an hour and after I stopped I walked into my kitchen and my brain just assumed the kitchen table wasn't actually there... We really need a real virtual reality device. The kind where we only THINK we move, but we really don't.  That's exactly what happened to me - I tried to lean, but I fell on the cat instead. We laughed and laughed. 10/10 would play again. Seriously, s/he dropped the ball missing that pun I've been looking for a shirt with this on. Anyone seen one? I feel like obviously if they have someone standing around at the demo to help out, they could also have that person wipe it down after every use. Yeah gotta bring some wet wipes hey! don't knock the Fiat Panda! that car is a tank-olino! 

I mean, sure it doesn't have a radio, and you have to manually roll down the windows, and if you drive over 40 km/h it sounds like you're in an airplane, and yeah the doors are paper thin and it only comes in two colors. But it's got good traction and the you'll never give a shit about scratches. The safety specs are decent and it turns on a dime. It's actually fun to drive!

Anything that Ubisoft makes is like a giant minivan with a million extra features that you never asked for. The minivan can only do a nine-point U-turn and the doors are probably thicker than a person and about as heavy as a small child. In fact, I bet they have a button that automatically opens the door in order to solve that problem, and god forbid there are any technical problems, because then you can't get the door open. Naturally, the ignition is a *button* so of course if the button fails, you've got to pay to fix *that.* You see where I'm going with this. It's just shiny bloat, when it works it's wonderful but as soon as it doesn't it's a royal pain.

When something on the Fiat Panda doesn't work, you just don't give a shit because it will typically be very minor.

I can't believe I spent time on this. I am calling it: Crytek is the Ferrari in that analogy. Haha ;) so like mixing up a brand to a specific model? Haha corrected, ty ;) I would never leave my house. nope... played on gaming tower.
This is at a microsoft store where they always have xbox on display. Feels like experiencing an instant headache for me I think it's a she. But they were playing a game called "Richies Plank Experience" where you're ontop of a very tall building and the objective is to walk a plank. This player decided that they were going to jump off the building like some sort of savage animal. 

Here's a screenshot: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TEv5dpXspCA/hqdefault.jpg right, but he's on a show and performing for an audience.

when I tried VR, it's more fun to "ham it up" a bit when people are watching you do it as opposed to if you're just sitting there by yourself. > A møøse once bit my sister

No realli! She was Karving her initials on the møøse with the sharpened end of an interspace tøøthbrush given her by Svenge - her brother-in-law - an Oslo dentist and star of many Norwegian møvies: "The Høt Hands of an Oslo Dentist", "Fillings of Passion", "The Huge Mølars of Horst Nordfink"... No arms you say.. Absolutely... way more so than for PS4, or any console IMO that could ever come out.  There might only be a few games you can get VR from Oculus that you might like, but hook your Oculus to Steam and BAMB, you have this huge library of games, many of which are actually fun to play, and the experience is wonderful.  It is what 3D wishes it could be.  Just be warned... you WILL require a powerful rig to run this thing. How do I PM people? What's an Internet Can confirm  Well we have to wait for Christmas. Member the hoverboard videos? he was just showing me his floppy* Did he have to unzip to see them?  >Swallowing a log

FTFY
 I wonder if I would gag performing a VR blowjob on a giant cock?  *Guy 4 asserts dominance* Your illustration captured the low hanging head of a man who has truly given up. The head being one space forward really makes the whole image. That one character truly shows the depths of that man's plight. Help desk every day ever. im on mobile and i have no idea what is going on. That's the best comment I've seen in a while, fantastic illustration well at least they get to see stuff like this once in a while. Can't see on mobile :( I don't think I have ever seen an ASCII vignette convey so much emotion and context at once (and I've seen the ASCII Star Wars movie).

This is now a permanent part of internet lore. My buddy used to just whip his galaxy s7 into our friends pool. Like 7 feet of water above his phone. Never broke. The S7 is crazy Well, the Nokia phone used to be invincible to hammers, but it was until Microsoft attacks.
 :') :) Well the black guy ran away so I think they were watching magic tricks! I think it's the scoredudes Seems like someone lost the penalty kick... you know, that soccer thing. The coach Jurgen Klinsmann is the one that disappears. Who invited Steve? No idea this face had a name ヽ(。_°)ノ

 57 I like 68´s, you suck me off and i owe you one.
 I tried it a couple weeks ago! It's awesome! (anti-psychotics) This is how riots happen. I've full-up punched the ceiling trying to hit a butterfly. Turns out the ceiling doesn't get a grid like the walls/floor... and the Vive components are built like a *tank*. :)

**Obligatory Edit**: Woah, after five years, my biggest comment is about trying to punch butterflies. VR is a wild drug. i just got my vive this week and i got my dad on a zombie game, first thing he does is swing for it and i wish i hadnt have stood so close to him because he whacked me right in the side of the head with the controller What is pulling a ronnie o'sullivan. I'm a huge fan of his work, but all I can think of is that your dad became the most mind blowing person to ever play billiards.  Has ronnie took a spill that I'm unaware of? I wish I had that much confidence in drunk-me "turn my chaperone off"

What does this mean? I read that as 'stupid fucking cunt'. 

Classic grandma.  im honored to have someone honored to to meet me. Plus i just like being called the guardian, it sounds cool and pretty much sums up my position in my social circle a lot of the time. that is more like 99% of people. The year is 2006:

*Testers are playing the new installment of Mario Kart for the revolution while a Nintendo employee is watching. They are basically steering their controllers like a real car* "Hmm. I have an idea." **And so, Mario Kart Wii's motion controls were born** yes. Here is how I will explain it. If you are a person that gets immersed very easily (e.g. jump in  movie theater at a scary part) you will immerse more in VR.

 I used to fly quads (drones) with those first person gogles that give you a birdseye view from a camera on the craft. IT took a bit to get used to flying them standing up because of the immersion you get from the experience.  I don't think there is a correlation.

I happen to be in the 50% that can stand fine on the VR roller coasters, however I find myself leaning while gaming quite a bit. The body can't live without the mind. Deadmau5 should really keep off the meth. Why is Ezreal in this picture? Is that Danger Ehren?
 Whats this from There are other games in this test that you really cant sit for. Such as basketball. People just need to have an *ounce* of self-awareness when putting something on their head that completely obscures their vision of the real world. Neither the Rift nor this game are made as sit down experiences.  This game is much, much better played standing up.  That's even more true with Touch controllers. Yeah, but doing that while sitting down screws with the VR aspect of it. You can't really get into it if you are sitting down. It's called drake and josh you heathen Hmm. Drake and Josh. Doesn't sound so bad.
 \*This study sponsored by VR\* Thank you! That makes me feel way better. Pink eye is highly contagious, or so my dr told me when I went. It's very possibly I caught it otherwise, but I've never been prone to infection.
I don't want to start any fear mongering, but I think eye infections are a good reason to be cautious. But this is a demo set being used by hundreds of people. What goggles get used by hundreds of people? I assume rental places wash them down first anyway.  I don't see why websites need a higher framerate than 90 fps, but ok. Can't say I've seen any places advertising to try vr out in the U.K. Tbh. Though once the price was announced I kinda stopped caring. If they're in a third world country, yeah, it might be difficult.  Otherwise there should be retailers somewhere near you that are demoing.  It doesn't have to be Gamestop.  I know there are Gamestop like entities in Berlin.  You're not savages.  On top of that, there's sites like meetup.  They have VR meetups all the time. I haven't tried one yet but I'm assuming you're talking about the Omni.  They haven't even shipped their kickstarter backers yet.  They are about three years behind.  I have zero faith in them at this point.  They seem to be pulling investor after investor from all over the globe but they obviously haven't perfected what it is they want to do yet or they'd be shipping by now.  The kickstarter ones were supposed to ship Q1 2014.  Their website continuously pushes up another quarter (right now it's Q1 2017, we'll see what happens next month).   ...uhh, the implications of what you just said are a bit odd 5 bucks can easily turn into $900.  Unless you don't have a gaming PC then 5 bucks can easily turn into $2,000+. Just another day in the office  It's certainly an arcade title and not any kind of sim. Where the install base is still so dang small, it was probably a smart move to try to capture a broader audience in that regard than to put accuracy over what their experimenting told them is fun to the average gamer. And I do feel like they made a fun game. Worth a try if you haven't; as others have said you can demo this game at some Best Buy locations. 

We're definitely still in a phase where developers are throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. Motion sickness is still tough for some people, development is still relatively complex relative to traditional games, and so many elements of game design that work well on a monitor just don't work as well in VR. None of that makes these criticisms invalid, but I will say that I've been surprised often by what I end up liking in VR and what I don't. This game is an example of an experience that is pretty foreign to me, but presented in such a way that I felt like I had very intuitive control over immediately. Personally that's something I've found to go very very far.  That's hot. shit that guy is boring Oh, man! Imagine Wild Gunman on VR. Oh god, this is the start of the REAL danger of VR I've had to remind myself I can't simply point to where I want to teleport irl.... that was a sad realization haha. Jesus, sounds like something I would do. Yeah, as long as it can compensate for motion sickness / inner ear stuff. But then THEY wouldn't have had the opportunity to show them the opportunity they missed! But then that's an extra staff member that is tied up. > It's actually fun to drive!

Well I give you that much. My friend had a Fiat Panda and Fiat 127 late 90's and we used to race with them on his neighbors field. They both weigh like a couple of hundred kilos so the power to weight ratio is decent for general fuckaroundery. So yeah, I take  back what I said. Fiat Pand is more like an indie game that was made with passion but with too little resources, but it's still a blast to play. Can't say Ubi made anything like that in recent memory. I miss Crytek so much. Crysis2 is one of my favorite games of all time. It's not like there are any Ferraris that would not look good next to a Fiat panda. Got it. Haven't really been following the VR stuff, but it looks like it has potential yup, the one in sf on market street to be exact Are there any plans or is it already possible to use VR headsets with Xbone?  TF2 would be the tits with this considering how narrow the field of view feels in the game

Edit: [There are](http://vrgamesfor.com/platform/xbox-one/) column A <-> column B When this gif was posted in /r/vive there was a comment along the lines of "What was the thought process here? This would have been a terrible idea in either reality!" > like some sort of savage animal

Haha This makes me think we need a rollercoaster tycoon virtual reality mmo. It would be amazing to just build your own park and rake in the dough while walking around and enjoying your park with friends. That is devilishly hilarious. To shreds you say? I don't understand.. I thought the Oculus was the rig? Can someone explain why hooking it up to steam would require a powerful rig?  or can you plug the oculus in your usb? Yeah I already have the pc. But I'm very afraid of making a large purchase then not even using it much. I think I'll make the jump early 2017, hopefully a price change will occur I'll IM you instructions, what's your AOL user name?

Thanks doc I'm jealous of your username. Good one. I would imagine they have to be, i bet when they were initially testing it plenty of people fell. I hit someone in the head with a vive controller. Can confirm they are built like a tank. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZCAi0MLxAE > What is pulling a ronnie o'sullivan.

It's basically bending it like beckham. I wish I had that confidence in sober me.  Since no one actually answered you, the setting in the Vive for the in game wall grid is the chaperone. You can turn them off if you feel they ruin the immersion and have enough familiarity with your surroundings.  Letting the butler off for the day, basically. The vive has like a wall that slowly fades into view when you get too close to the boundaries of the play area. Basically to alert you that you are getting to close to fucking yourself up Other people have already answered, but it's like this: https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/04/04/be26204f-6f21-4dc5-a75b-abe8981b4f08/thumbnail/970x546/89d8bcbf6a5b8bb2e3f636b0d2b4804b/htc-vive-bluecage.jpg I contend that if you don't move your body playing mario kart, you likely have no soul. You belong in a museum Yep, he popped in for a few episodes. Portlandia  The VR team investigated this VR matter and it turned out that VR is perfectly fun, safe, and affordable. It is. But the fact is, it's really difficult to pinpoint the origin to a headset or some other kind of wear, mostly because there are so many other factors playing a role. First of all, eye rubbing and bad hygiene are pretty much on the top of the list of causes, not difficult to see why. Pair that with the fact that you can infect others simply by being in their vicinity and objects like HMDs become increasingly unlikely as a source. It's just that you are exposed to so many probable origins that an object - which doesn't even get into contact with your eyes in the first place - isn't really that statistically significant. I mean, we will see. People should wipe down their HMD anyways, but if pinkeye were a serious concern we'd know about it already.

As always there is a general lesson/theme here: wash your dirty hands, people! Just trying to be cheeky while complaining about the .3 fps when scrolling on that page because of all the crap they're trying to load in the background. What I really want is vive + 360 treadmill + prop controllers+ new VR elder scrolls game. I may forget to eat for a few days They've shipped to a small number of backers, maybe 100. Those folks enjoy them. 3 years just sucks, especially when about 90% of their monthly updates have been that they are 'on track', but at least they send monthly updates, and they have made some really significant changes to the product over those years that make it substantially more useful when it does show up. 

I got to try an early prototype years ago at an event near SDCC and I thought it was cool as shit/delivered on what the product claims to do. I don't know of a single third party game that natively supports it; there are many games that work great, but only after more unofficial configuration than most people will want to do. Takes up a ton of space and isn't terribly portable. 

It's simply gonna be a big pain in the ass most of the time. But the 5 minutes of Half Life 2 I played showed me that it's worth all that and the $400 it cost to back it, to me, to be able to physically run, jump, and shoot all the way through that world. It even kind of lets you sit down for the vehicle portions. If it actually gets me to run more, even better.  oops sorry, I got myself a new penisvr and am looking for friends to come try it! We got a free demo. Which turned into an $1,800 demo for us.  Hell, even if you have a gaming PC and just haven't bought a new GPU in the last year it'll turn into $1,400 real quick. Worth every penny though. I *think* OP is implying the things you see like in the Matrix. Essentially your brain is hijacked and the system sends the sensory inputs directly to the brain. Your brain responds, the system is simulated accordingly. But wouldn't they need at least one person manning a booth with such expensive equipment as this? I don't have much experience in VR, but I don't it's probably not quite like your usual "pick up the controller and jump in" that you'd see in a typical store. It's very much in the first-gen stage. I tell people it's like the first iPhone.  It's cool, and unlike anything else out there, but the tech is still new and on top of that people (and devs) don't really know how to use it yet.  But it's going to evolve very quickly. My favorite comment in that thread was the top one. "fucking wow" Link to thread? Think of the Oculus like a connection to your video card.  I take the HDMI out from my rig and put it into my Oculus so it is similar to a "second monitor."  This means your have to have a good GPU in order to run it.

Steam in itself can be seen as an application.  So you can use Steam as a store to get games that have VR support.  it is not hooking it up to Steam that requires a powerful rig; Oculus in itself requires powerful specks.  I have a gaming laptop and it barely runs it.  There are very few laptops that have the power to run it.  I have an Asus ROG laptop, and I had to get an adapter since the built in HDMI could not support the video. I would have never gotten one for myself.  The only reason I had not played it much is due to being sick.  This is one of the few "games" I certainly do not want to play while I am feeling sick. :) I don't have AOL, do you want my blackberry pin?

FTFY bless you homie Night mode is best mode Not all heroes wear capes Thank you sir, you're doing god's work. you deserve like 600 karma for that Thank you, I had no idea what the fuck was going on Look at Mr. Moneybags over here with his phone with adequate horizontal width to display all the characters properly Are you using the desktop version on your web browser? Because that would be why. On the app (and I expect on m.reddit.com) the text is narrowed to fit the screen, so that we don't have to zoom in and out. Haha, didn't expect that. Thanks for the pic.  I understand watermelon, chicken, grape Soda .... but fear of magic? That is times oddly well... Just a weird gif overall That still seems like an odd manager swap. I'm the same. I still don't even remember the name of my ex but I remember her butthole. You mean this one?

[ಠ_ಠ](https://i.imgur.com/R390EId.jpg)  I think the Job Simulator devs said at an event, that they had to replace controllers because testers kept trying to drop the controllers onto a virtual table, so they'd constantly fall from a decent metre up right onto the floor, when quitting the game. I wish I had confidence.  Thank you.  Robot butler? Man I'm really excited about HD Mario Kart on the switch. /r/totallynotrobots/ Oh..  S.6 E.01 Unlike the butter industry That's how it works. Were you expecting the Childrens Wish Foundation to fund research into eye herpes? IV injection monitor that has your in game food and thirst level equate to your actual nutrition level and matter manipulator to create the food available in game and put it in front of you in the position of the food in the game.  Problem solved. I would do this but then I'd forget to go to work, lose my job, and eventually the electric company and lease management company will have me forced out...  That's how it happens, man.  The tech is incredible.  I just regret that I don't have nearly as much time to play as I thought I would.   More Accurately/Recently, Sword Art Online, Full Dive. Here is a funny idea, if such system can be built, we could, theoretically, build one that hijacks memories. For instance, we could play a game where we actually believe we're the chosen one and are going to defeat the evil lord.  

Now, if that's the case, what if such technology already exists, and we (or at least me) are just part of a game where we simulate living like an alien race that lives on earth. Perhaps, when we die, we'll wake up lying in our bed with memories of a life we never knew existed. 

That's kinda cool.  Where I live, it was handled exactly this way. They put a big red comfy chair there, so you could sit down while you use it (even though most people rather stood up because the experience was so unique) and two different VR headsets (Vive and Oculus rift). A big sign said "Try for free NOW!".

Just went to grab a new cable for my phone with my friends and we saw it and tried it out. No staff member nearby or anything.
My friend went nuts trying it out, so we had to be careful around him. We also drew quite a big crowd lol and still no staff members nearby haha https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/5eiflp/be_careful_when_you_tell_someone_they_can_jump/ but the oculus itself comes with hardware too right?

FTFY
 👍 sub styles off too But they do all wear stretchy pants  I concur  I'm in portrait and it still shows up fine.  I'm using Relay and I can see it just fine.

Holding my phone verticly loops the text a bit but the picture itself is fine. Horizontally it looks just like on a desktop computer. I'm using the "Reddit is fun" app. Not in landscape. I see it fine. I'm on a droid x.  What do you mean you understand? Aziz does a skit about it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oLuxhYO5cw It's just another stereotype. It's been used in jokes by comedians, and literally every YouTube video about magic.  We all do. Oh well i had this so often in my first hours. So did my friends "you want to go for the next round? I lay them controllers down here - you see?" drops.. on the carpet luckily See, a pillow sounds like it could have saved them some money. Why don't they just have straps? Like Wii controllers. I wish I had drunk. Is there another kind? When you put it that way, sounds easy enough. How dare you touch me! I am the high King of Skyrim! The dragon born! Archmage of the college of winterhold! *Gets tasered* Figured Matrix was more widespread to the general population than SAO. I didn't want to go too niche, otherwise I'd start mentioning Overlord, Legendary Moonlight Sculptor, or Log Horizon haha. No, think of it like a monitor with a bunch of extra features. 
If you buy a monitor, you still have to have a computer to connect it to.  Thanks BFF Jill. That won't work, we'll have to use smoke signals  Steamy Sex? Does it have to be gay, or does steamy count? I don't discriminate, I just hope I'm not missing out due to a lack of bicuriousness. Agreed, best sex Sucking each other's dicks *Guy 8 called in sick, but in reality he only wanted an extra day off because it's been a rough month and he felt like he earned some extra time to himself.* Too, thank me. Right? Some subs are okay, but others make me wanna barf. I hate sub styles. Plain is best. Sometimes, grownups wear stretchy pants when they're alone. For fun. Look at Mr. Moneybags over here with his phone with adequate horizontal width _in portrait mode_ to display all the characters properly! I mean watch David Blaine do street magic on black people, they freak the fuck out. Its like for a half second they truly believe in magic and it blows their mind. Or wrist straps. But where would you put the pillow? The Vive controllers do have straps I believe, but you have to actually use them, for that to work.

Someone drops the controller, you think it's a one-off. Then you finally break something and start using the straps. I wish I was a little bit taller I wish SAO was advertised on City Busses where I am, so I am fairly sure it's no longer quite Niche. oh.

So everyone has to have a powerful gpu in their pc to go along with the oculus eh? everyone runs it from a pc I assume?  Sex. steamed ham Thank. Fucking fatcats Get outta here with your superior sensibility They come with wrist straps in the consumer version! They had the Tatooine one at Star Wars Celebration this year, and the controller definitely had a strap. I wish I was a baller I'm drunk.  [deleted] Yup.  You forgot the gay. And the steamy.

~~some of the best parts dog~~ memes dank, too.  I wish I had a girl so you are just paying for the goggles? had no idea

 So that's what I'm supposed to do when I fly a helicopter and hear the beeping. /r/hitboxporn I like how he just had a katana laying around. I'm not even mad, that's amazing Deadpool did this to Bullseye once and  Bullseye was too impressed to be upset. It reminds me of the Desert Combat mod for bf1942. I flew towards a helicopter with my jet. Just as was about to collide, the game lagged, and after that I apparently ran over and killed the helicopter pilot without colliding to the helicopter. Amazing stuff. He just went full Genji afterwards  ***yeah that was very awesome***
 There was a story of Russians driving in Afghanistan during the war in the eighties with windows all open due to the horrible heat, when suddenly a rocket just blew into the vehicle and straight out of the vehicle through the other open window. The whole crew had a mild "Holy fucking shit how are we alive?!" moment. Seriously, though, shouldn't those kinds of missiles detonate on proximity to avoid stuff like this? Why even be mad? That was awesome. Somewhat [similar](http://i.imgur.com/cdjE6n9.jpg) Right as the missile went through the heli's door the BF1942 theme started to play in my head.

It meshes well with the rest of the gif.  Deadpool does it again. So *that's* who's been calling my mother a whore for the past decade... Thats some high quality Hit-Box porn you have there. When your pilot has 1000+ in-game flying hours. When the game gets too realistic. :D I'm surprised Little Dickey didn't write a song about that Asks for realism, gets rekt by realistic physics. Robert Jordan (James Oliver Rigney), the writer of the Wheel of Time book series, frequently told a story about this happening to him in Vietnam, though he was in the chopper, and probably had a different reaction. At least his case of Newcastle is safe The original Battlefield 2, I still remember how impressive it was that your rocket could shoot THROUGH the helicopter cabin.  It blew me away when watching their *in-game* trailer and seeing that. Didn't realise Puppey played Arma Kappa The pilot waz probably like "wtf was that noise in the back" I never understood why RPGs in games are always so damned slow.
They're much, much faster IRL...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6KdHfP_0x8 Looks like /u/Lil-Dicky smashing everything That's why I think the touch of realism to some physics makes B4 slightly funnier and interesting.  /r/oddlysatisfying Reminds me of [this panel](http://i.imgur.com/dMiZz.jpg) with Deadpool and Bullseye (who is dressed as Hawkeye). What a lucky gender! Threading the needle I don't see how stuff like this happens when sometimes you can miss them by 10ft and they still explode.  That's... fucking.... awesome.. s/o to that pilot  That's why you only use rockets with grenades and horshoes what is the name of this game? plz tell Reminds me of that time, years ago, I was playing Starcraft 2 in 4v4.   

My teams had been getting cannon rushed all night--seemed to be envogue. It was getting really old really fast.    

So I told my teammates, "Make sure you check the base for probes"  

Sure enough, none of my teammates give a shit. Sure enough, sent my SCV over to work on a section of our base and...yep...multiple cannons being set up.  

Now, it's important to know that I was using a $4,000 Alienware and I had a large, open bottle of effervescent water. I slammed my fists down on my desk that it tipped over and spilled all over my laptop.  

You can probably guess how it turned out.   That's not pain... it shows how great BF physics are!!  "Did everybody see that because i will not be doing it again" Deadpool was driving. Those hit boxes are better than IRL r/hitboxporn r/HitBoxPorn i aint even mad File that under hitbox porn I wouldnt even be mad i would laugh my ass off Someone said 'get cancer' in the chat lmao.

Gamers are hilarious. Pain? More like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/dMiZz.jpg) I've never in my life had enough money to throw a tantrum like that. I've certainly felt angry enough to do something like that, but knowing I have to replace what I damage is always a factor. Do alot of people still play battlefield 4? ruined a great gif  I wouldn't even be mad. That's impressive. Sorry for your loss.  That's why they always aim for the tail in the movies. This is so awesome.
 Smashes computer that isn't even turned on.  Where are youuuu I didn't watch the gif cut to the other clip until the end. Makes it way funnier lol Shiiiit... I aint even mad bruh. Probably set up I've done this myself Stick beats all. Wow, Lip really let himself go after college.  Pro... Thats a really skillful pilot. Now that's just unfortunate. Wolverine! You know you're bad when you miss with the SRAW... Everyone in that helicopter  needs new pants  Good hitboxes save lives Calculated. Just like Tropic Thunder!  That hitbox tho <3 I'm just impressed he didn't spill his drink in all that carnage.  Is the guy raging in the last part named Brian? He looks and acts suspiciously like an old roommate. This happened to me a few months ago, breath was exhaled very fast and loud. What the hell was that monitor? I assumed it was CRT but then I realized it's flat panel that looks 20 years old? I can only guess it's Gateway. Guys like that are idiots. 'I was super mad at a VIDEO GAME and broke my crap. Now I have to replace it.' i wish the hit boxes in dragon quest builders were even half this good. Anyone else notice the video is wide screen but the monitor is square? It could be letter box but at that resolution he would have to be playing on wait is it a meme? r/nevertellmetheodds Would love to see this from the pilot's perspective  I wish these airships from Bf1 would have accurate hitboxes like this when crashing This is why I always use the SMAW.  Who would smash there computer over 400 missed points It is a pain in the ass to miss a helicopter, but scary as hell when you are the pilot and you hear the rocket pass you. It's funny that he had a baseball bat sitting beside his PC... he knew this day would come. This one hurts the soul... like throwing a hot dog down a hallway Good technique on that sword. Source: https://youtu.be/HnIgga7D-o0?t=3m7s Who aims for the cockpit? Aim for the engine block! If it was me it would hit it but not explode been there
 What map is that?  bahahahaha!  That's the SRAW, isnt it? They 'patched' it, it's not even a disable anymore if you hit the heli!!! 

DICE is really that oblivious. You can even see the saltiness on the chat, someone saying there "Get cancer"... ♫Cuz baby you're a fiiiiiireworrr...♫ **shit damn fuck!** It is overreacting is what that is, bitch needs to calm the fuk down What is more impressive is that the actual physics of the game will allow that to happen.   That collision detection though... "You can't trust that Dean Ambrose! He's a lunatic!" Holy shit this has 100% happened to me before, I thought I was crazy. Not mad at the game anymore though, at least it's realistic lol Simple solution: Play Battlefield 1.

It simply can't happen to you there because RPGs weren't invented yet in WW1. :) This reminds me of an old gif of a dude trashing his office computer in the 90's. That's the one reason I don't keep a bat by my desk.  Lil D needs to chill That's like me when my receivers drop a pass in Madden. That's when you just close battlefield  What game is this? I know it's sucks when that happens, but I've always appreciated that bit of realism when it comes to battlefield. Hit boxes are actually fairly accurate when it comes to vehicles and bodies.  What happened? Pls fill me in On the other hand, a player just survived being shot at by the fact that the rocket went through a door in his helicopter. It was much worse when you actually hit it and even saw the explosion but the game decided you didn't. Ooook thanks. Like the Eighties movie "Red Dawn" Where a bunch of teens fight off the red army invading America. Just think, if you had hit it, you wouldn't have had all these beautiful upvotes.  I did this with a tank shell one time, was pretty frustrating. just wow!! at least a TiVo didn't block the shot  It took me a few loops to realize that was a fucking sword. Lol, that is nuts. At least you didn't completely miss like I usually do! this pain is horrible at last That's some golden collision detection.   Dat hitbox, tho You could do that a million times and you could never miss that badly twice! I put my fist through a wall once when my computer pissed me off. :( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4eHlhDg-D8 that's fucking dumb destroying your computer like that... Ryūjin no ken wo kūrae!!!!!! FPS Doug did it better way back in 2006
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsQFYceNZS8

Part of the Pure Pwnage web series I know the raging was edited in but who in the right mind would rage like that and break everything... It's like in NBA Jam when you get the ball, your offensive defender knocks down your opponents, you have a clear shot with nobody around you AND YOU MISS A DUNK. I wouldn't even be mad... that hitbox. TIL BF3 had better hitboxes than ARMA 3 Barely missed the Jesus nut.  Guy looked like Trihex lol So did the helicopter do that on purpose because it looks that way. Impressive. r/hitboxporn Every time I see the clip at the end I wonder why the dude has that sword Shoulda had Grenades and Horseshoes.  
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  That guy went Negan on that computer  My Dick shrimped like a little fish while watching this That has happened to me way too many times. He just slammed a solid piece of metal into an LCD monitor which stores voltages between 15k and 30k...

Dumbest shit I've seen all week, and I work in IT  Goddamn I miss these Battlefield moments. I just don't have time to sink into an FPS like I used to, but these sorts of posts give me that that little hit I need. I was playing the combat sim. on realistic for the platinum; and it crashed on round 15. Crashed for the first time in my life. This has happened to me on several occasions.  hell - i remember that rockets flying through heli doors being a big deal on one of the BF2 game trailer back around 2004? Hyde? That sword-like object... I see you've met my ex husband. Seriously, we found pieces of the keyboard until we moved. http://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Reach/FileDetails.aspx?fid=7032862&player=Halcylon That helo's pull out game is strong Exhaust would have killed anyone sitting in the chopper and set it aflame on the inside. can somebody link me to the dude fucking shit up in his shitlord dungeon  I love how he's already prepared the bat  Is there a source for the original video of the guy trashing his room? I feel like I'd enjoy the full version of that and any other tantrums that guy has out there. The pilot just let the missile go through because all he wanted was heat. Pretty cold up there because of atmospheric level you know. I think his computer crashed. "Incoming! Open the doors and turn 'er sideways!" You're really supposed to take a large rubber sheet and stretch it in the frame of the door to slingshot the missile back, but this guy is clearly a novice pilot. I don't think the helicopters beep with the tow missile You wouldn't hear beeping on this one because this wasn't a homing missile. This was a guided missile, so no locking on or anything. Take the shot like a man.  This is why tanks carry multiple types of ammunition.  Well, not specifically for helicopters since helicopters are more dangerous to a tank than a tank is to a helicopter.  Mostly for other APCs or light armored vehicles.

The main round for an Abrams tank is the Sabot round.  It is a a hardened dart made of Depleted Uranium that is about 27mm in diameter.  This round is capable of penetrating most known tank armor.  It is a tank killer round, and only used on tanks, because a traditional explode on impact round wouldn't penetrate another tank's armor.

The problem with the sabot is that if you aren't shooting another tank the sabot round will over penetrate.  So if you an APC center mass with a Sabot round it will go in one side and out the other, leaving the vehicle relatively in tact and operational.  You might not even kill all the troops in the back of it.  

The same goes to most helicopters, especially troop transport helicopters.  The round will punch through and won't cause enough damage to brink the helicopter down.  This gives the helicopter enough time to either return fire or turn tail and run.  When I was in armor school they showed us a video of a HIND get hit with 3 sabot rounds before it finally crashed.  

It was a training video, the HIND was tethered to the ground and had no pilot.  I'm not sure if it was remotely operated or if it was just set to take off and hover at a certain height.  Either way, it took 2 rounds to the broadside and kept flying.  The 3 round finally impacted just below the rotors and brought it down.

This is why a tank should fire HEAT, or MPAT-air when shooting at a helicopter. Where we find the other side to this story https://i.imgur.com/Sv1KCes.jpg Question: Is it really this accurate? I'm always getting killed out of the blue so have no idea Meanwhile in CSGO I go behind a wall and see no one on my screen, yet somehow get killed. https://i.imgur.com/shJi68x.jpg Nah, bro. He was doing a barrel roll so he had I frames Same mind friend The video seems a little suspect for good hitboxing.

It *seems* like just as the missile reaches the heli the trajectory changes slightly and you can see it jitter.

If you play it in slow motion you can see what I mean just as it reaches 4 seconds.

It looks like the missile was going to hit the inside roof of the heli, but there might be a custom animation: if the missile is close enough to the door's angle have it follow a certain path through the heli.

Hard to be sure though, and neat either way. It just may not be excluding the inside of the heli from its hitbox. You don't?  While you played games, he studied the blade. M'usashi /r/mallninjashit and a camera
 justgamerthings I actually have a replica sword from Heroes. I've never hit anything with it though so I don't know how sturdy it is. Usually after watching so much walking dead you just figure a katana is a necessity Wait, what do you destroy *your* gaming station with when you rage out? Only the most elite of elite PCMR are allowed to have them. Or fifteen year olds who think they're cool and have to sneak said awesome weaponry into their room. Gods that was a long time ago.  Rage katanas are necessary for every gamer. Everyone knows one sword guy. The sword guy I know has like a dozen. He unsheathed it quite readily. My thoughts exactly. It would be damn near impossible to hit that shot on purpose, and this guy goes and does it no fucks given.  [Oh, you mean this?](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/03/80/56/038056b395a4ccd91e117ee5517de390.jpg) Okay, yeah, I admit it.

That was &#$@ing awesome. I frikken love Deadpool vs Bullseye Desert Combat was fucking awesome.  There was what like 4 versions of it? I think those mods really pushed the developers to do more recent genres.  Except for 2142..... I liked occasionally shooting down low flying jets with my tank main gun Is that a pro Genji?! Ryūjin no ken o kurae! He also had cardboard computer parts, insane! me too thanks I doubt that moment was mild No, because it's a shaped charge and meant for tanks, not helicopters.  

A shaped charge would lose its penetrating power if it detonated on proximity.  Those kinds of missiles should also be going at 100x that speed but I guess because of hurrr balancing they made them go in slowmo.
[
This is how fast an actual RPG travels](https://youtu.be/y6KdHfP_0x8?t=104) No, but if it's a proper missile then it should be going much, much faster.  With real missiles you don't see any travel.  You fire it and it blows up.  They're not slow.  At all.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A I found the reading order of those panels to be confusing as hell  Wait, I watched this movie a couple days ago and I don't get it. Comic reference? This is a guide missile you can aim after you fired it. I reckong it's to make it easier to aim, while keeping it from being overpowered. balance Lag compensation. Or proximity fuses. Anti Air rockets are designed to explore when they're close enough since it doesnt take alot of damage to take down a plane or chopper, the rocket OP uses is Anti Armor meant against tanks and if those would explode based on proximity, they'd lose their penetrating power and be largely useless Battlefield 4 that's not a baseball bat that's a sword.. Golmud Railway The AT rocket whateveritscalled is an ok substitute imo. Very destructive, kills anyone it his directly, and damages and disables vehicles too.  Battlefield 4 The door on the copter is open. As it turns, the RPG goes straight through the open door and out the other side without hitting the copter. yes u r right  that was a fun 20 minutes going through those I really need to know now if that has happened in the history of modern warfare. If you are polite and let the missile in it will let itself out.  Yep, that what they teach in army Fucking amateurs  Ah... the ole Wile E. Coyote defense. I just laughed so hard at this. Anybody else read that in Sarge's voice from Red vs. Blue? Actually, you have to whip out the rocket return device from the backend of the helo.  It is basically a metal tube shaped like a U that you just hold up.  This was the upgrade to the rubber sheet technology. GOOD point  That's when you do it manually..


**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** 

I FUCKING SAID **BEEP** YOU IDIOT!!

^^you ^^don't ^^have ^^to ^^yell... Dude, it's BF4, your helicopter is going to be beeping from the moment you leave the ground!  To be fair, if it was an IR tracking missile you wouldn't get a warning either.
Some aircraft, like the A10-C have a generic missile launch warning that looks for a light/heat spike to identify a launch but it has no concept of where the missile is going or who fired it so it can trigger from friendly shots headed in a different direction.
For most helo's though, the only way you can see a missile coming at you is to use your eyeballs. Get you science out of here! That's been something that happens since BF2 in the BF series. 

EDIT: I'm aware that's ARMA in the screen shot. I'm stating that this has been around since at least 2005 that I know of with BF2.  Wouldn't irl the missile detonate in that situation? I was under the impression that most modern missiles didn't use impact fuses especially ones meant to be shooting at a soft target like a helicopter. Only needs to explode near the target to bring it down My favorite part of this is the pilot's arm position like, "Hey, I'm flyin' here!" If you look close, you can see the puckered ass cheeks of the heli pilot. That's dumb, anti air missiles have proximity detonators The gif itself? Yes.  Interp isn't the same thing as hitboxes dawg. I always have two in case someone pulls a gun on me. You don't choose the neckbeard life. The neckbeard life chooses you. No, he does like it. I'm just a poor sap with a long sword... I thought he was busy performing at Lil Dicky concerts. It's just how he does things That just happened to be recording. I'm willing to bet it's cheap steel and relatively weak. I bought a $20 "katana" from Scheels a few years ago for shits and giggles and my buddy broke the blade off the handle just swinging it. I ended up drilling two holes in the blade and bolted on a new handle, then used it for real life fruit ninja. Works pretty well. I'm pretty sure fucks were given.  If he does mean that, it's Hawkeyes not Bullseye right? Thank god someone linked this.  This was also from the same arc where he gets the arrow stuck in his head and picks up radio signals.  Good times. What does that word even say? That was ____ awesome I can't figure out WTH is happening here. Are comic books normally this disorienting? Thank you. I couldn't make out what that word before 'awesome' was in that low quality picture. 2142 was awesome, aside from the performance issues in multiplayer. Hey, you could even say it may have inspired Titanfall or the newer CoDs. Maybe. 2142 was based off the star wars and GI Joe mods, I believe. Damn... 1942 mods were so good. I miss those days.  "occasionally"

DC was so fun THAT'S A PRO GENJI

*dashes into pit* TIL Like reading a manga [deleted] It's because it's 3 separate pages put side by side.  Yea, Deadpool dogged a rpg fired by Bullseye once by doing that. Bullseye was actually mildly impressed. Yup! Bullseye fired a rocket at him while he was driving a truck. Deadpool swerved and rolled down the windows. The rocket passed right through the truck. Bullseye even admitted that it was a really cool move. It is a comic book reference. It has bullseye pretending to be hawkeye. Im pretty sure someone will come along with a link. Same reason why tank shells are so slow? thanks . i will upvote u for help. haha oh shit seriously? thanks for the correction. The Gif is really choppy and pixelated for me. Thanks! I had my suspicions. This happened to one of my dad's friends in vietnam. Apparently he's got the burn scars to prove it. Overwritten by a script? What does that even mean? 2 meta
or should i say 2 beta I DONT KNOW WHAT WE ARE YELLING ABOUT!  Not with screenshots of that quality though If I love BF and like BF3 and 4 WAY more than BF1, would I like Arma. 

I was looking at Steam Stats and a FUCK load of people are playing Arma 2 and 3. I had no idea it was that popular.  In the BF1942 mod Desert Combat, I was able to line up a frogfoot and shoot inside the ac-130 through the loading ramp that was left down, and kill all the players that were at the gunner stations Can confirm. I've missed a lot of shots in BF2 and BF3, some like this! Shit, I thought the screenshot was real til this comment yes many explode next to the target. The missile that downed that plane over Ukraine exploded next to the plane sending shrapnel all over the place and shredding the plane proximity fuses use radar, yeah... but OP'S pic I think was a non guided missile which would have a simple impact fuze Anti-tank missiles penetrate armor and explode inside the tank.

Anti-air missiles get close enough, then explode outside the plane, shredding the airframe.

Proximity explosion is very old technology, and was even used in flak bullets in WW2 Absolutely. Not only proximity fuses make the "target" much larger, they also sometimes do more damage. In this case it wouldnt, as this is probably a guided missile. Ever since WWII at the battle of Marianas Islands. First use of proximity fuses.  No, it's not accurate. That's why he missed. More like maybe.

Chances are a missile launcher like that would use some sort of targeting system.

If that's true it would detonate the missile when it reached the target, regardless of whether or not it makes contact. What's interp? I know, its just a meme at this point. Excuse me while I put down my weapon.... Hyahhhh!  That's right I've got another one!  If someone has 2 katanas on them, going full samurai, I would not fuck with them.  Oh, you have a gun, do you?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_8BzXING-A you should use 3, make Zoro Proud!  While you were pulling your gun, I studied the blade.  Remember to shout BAN-KAI before to instil maximum fear https://youtu.be/wAkCLpMtjlM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2LU-lC-WX0 Reminds me of that guy with the 9 yard rule or whatever.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk59imFr6yI This sounds exactly like something Dwight would say Gotta deflect those bullets somehow. And then knife catalogs find your home I think mine was like 90? I was pretty frivolous back in those days. And bat swings No that's Bullseye dressed up as Hawkeye. This was from a time when Norman Osborn (Green Goblin) was made head of SHIELD. He outlawed all the real avengers and replaced them with villain equivalents- attempting to pull the wool over the public's eye. I believe it's supposed to be "fucking". I couldn't find any hi res versions.

Basically, they fired a rocket at Deadpool's jeep. Deadpool then swerved to the side so that the rocket went straight through the open windows. There are three Titanfall games. 2142, Titanfall and Titanfall 2.  There is a youtube vid of the katana guy with the Genji ultimate sound on top that i've been searching for for weeks now but cant find. Saw it in some 4chan YLYL compilation... top keks where had Is that a pro cop? ...but backwards.

So, like reading a regular comic from the West? Isn't that hawkeye? I mean... maybe he burned himself on the oven and didn't want to look silly so he just tells everyone he almost took a rocket to the face.  I did that when I cut my fingers open chopping a banana. 

"0ngar... how did you get those scars on your hand?"

"uuhh.. knife fight with Steven Seagal..." What, like, from the exhaust as the thing passed by? That is insane. LOUD NOISES I think I saw that this shot is a bullshot, not actual gameplay. Plus, the above screenshot is from ARMA. The gif and screenshot are awesome regardless!
 Arma is honestly nothing like battlefield.  Arma is very much a simulation, a hardcore strategy game through and through, combat is probably 1% if not less of the time you are playing, the rest is tactics, figuring out deployment strategies, and whatever else.

Basically, its unlikely you would enjoy it, its in a category of its own. It's popular and a good series, but it's in no way similar to BF.

If you like RP and are patient you will have a lot of fun playing it! From what I've played of it, it's far more realistic. As in it's 99% prep work and 1% fighting. But it also makes it more time consuming. 

It's 2 completely different games and ways of fighting even though they are both FPS set it in the same time.  If you look up ShackTac on youtube, you'll see how hardcore simulated ARMA can be.  Lots of good stuff to watch, not sure how fun it would be to play, but like someone posted above, it is a different animal. Check out squad on steam. It's free this weekend plus 50 percent off if you decide to buy it. I think it's the perfect mix between battlefield and arma.  I love BF but I can't play Arma. Arma requires loads of time and patience.  Generally speaking - because of the vast amount of time it takes to do stuff on arma, getting kills is much more rewarding and dying is much more painful. 

If you've got anger management issues, stay away Take a look at r/squad If you can find the right people to play it with, you get experiences like [THIS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPd_SoZaCA4) Check out Dslyecxi on YouTube, he belongs to a group called ShackTac and posts a lot of their Arma missions. It will give you a really good idea of what its like. Haha, i remember that. You could also get inside of it at the other team's spawn and  wait. Someone would spawn in it and take off with you in the back. Then you could shoot people as they spawned in the stations until you ran out of ammo, then you could throw down c4 and jump out the back.  IIRC Most, if not all, SAM and Air to Air missiles work like this.  They track close and then explode sending shrapnel everywhere. How you know this Actually OP was using the SRAW manually guided missile. > Anti-tank missiles penetrate armor and explode inside the tank.

Actually HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) missiles are shaped charges which explode on the outside of the tank and use the explosion to fire a stream of superheated metal through the armour.

 Some weapons use impact fuzes either because the target is moving *extremely* fast, or because the target is hard enough that shrapnel wouldn't do enough damage.

For an example of the former, ICBM interceptors (aside from the ones that use nuclear warheads) aim for impact (and don't actually have fuzes at all, because kinetic energy is enough) because the hypersonic target is moving many times faster than the propagation speed of chemical explosives. This makes timing a proximity fuze really difficult, so they don't even try.

For the latter, the original Patriot missile used a proximity fuze. There were some instances in the Gulf War where the Patriot would successfully intercept a SCUD and shred the missile, but leave the warhead intact to potentially still fall on its target. The most recent Patriot variant has shifted to a hit-to-kill technique to avoid this.

Aircraft tend to be a lot easier to destroy and not fly at hypersonic speeds, so proximity fuzing still works well there. You have to be incredibly accurate to miss that way  interpolating (ping-delayed) client positions/actions on the server https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6EwaW2iz4iA Interpolation - the game's netcode assuming your position without knowing it (it can't know it all the time, only a certain amount of ticks a second).  CSGO is actually very good at this, as is bf1 and Bf4 now (Bf4 was terrible on release). Oof, did you see his other video where he tells LOUD NOISES in a restaurant to try to act funny while his friends sit next to him uncomfortably?  You gotta show all the fuccbois out there! Neither would any woman on planet Earth, apparently. Two swords? Is that in case the first one breaks? Smart. Even at half samurai power, the neckbeard is still a dangerous beast I'll put down my weapon... I'll put down my weapon... I'll put down my... **WEAPON!!** Or eight, like Killer Bee.  Reference that I know only from the fact that it is a reference that is frequently referred to on reddit!  It's almost like knowing the source, but without actually knowing the source! I still get a feeling of being a part of something largely worthless!  Well, I'm scared already. Especially if it's Tozen's bankai  BUDK 4 LYFE That was a sword  I'm sorry, is this for real? Hahaha I feel like this is just marginally related to what you guys are talking about but I'll post it anyway: http://thehawkeyeinitiative.com/ Well he sure fooled me  It looked to me like it started with M and ended with UN https://youtu.be/Mj97OFEDfn4 There was a comment somewhere above explaining the getup. 

> This was from a time when Norman Osborn (Green Goblin) was made head of SHIELD. He outlawed all the real avengers and replaced them with villain equivalents- attempting to pull the wool over the public's eye.

 Bullseye was posing as Hawkeye as an Avenger. Him and a bunch of other villains did this. Venom became Spidey, Daken was Wolverine, and Moonstone was Ms. Marvel. They make banana slicers if you want to conserve the sharpness of your katana. Definitely plenty enough to burn you. It's a set up screenshot of Arma 3.

That thing shouldn't happen, because AA missiles use proximity sensors to detonate, not contact The guy who made this screenshot stated that it was staged in the editor after he saw this happen with RPG. He just wanted to see if it was actually possible and take a great looking shot with it. god damn I thought it was real Playing Domination in ARMA3.

Get dropped into the AO after waiting half an hour.

Engage in firefight, push towards the objective.

Surrounded by bots because quality team leader.

Hail of bullets.

Shot in the legs.

Crawling towards the medic.

Evac chopper shot down on the way in.

Bleed out.

Repeat. Combat is a lot higher than 1% in ARMA Depends what you play.  I usually play the Exile mod which I'd say is about 50% combat.  

Your first point stands though.  Arma is nothing like Battlefield. Hiking Simulator 2016 would it be hard to jump in now? 

man... some online games if you don't start from launch, you are fucked.  If you get some friends (or join a server and make friends. The community isn't toxic and most people are chill) load up some custom stuff or learn Zeus/Eden and you can have fun for a long time. 

I have around 600 hrs in Arma 3 and 467 in arma 2 oa Would you say that if you already like BF, try squad and enjoy it, that it's likely you'll get on well with arma? Easy there, Satan... [This video is incredible.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHzavUArAXQ) That is how anti aircraft missiles work. AA missiles generally have that capability since a direct strike, while preferable, is still tricky when the missile is self guided and both it and the target are moving hundreds of miles an hour and likely maneuvering as well. So, they detonate within blast radius knowing that most any shrapnel damage will cause great harm to most modern jets that are more built for speed,  maneuverability and/or stealth. Now, if it's an A10 Warthog, well you better have several shots at it.  /u/Roborowan is actually Russian President Pu Apparently there was some sort of investigation or something.  Gut feeling  That's Putin.  I wonder why those don't have an "alt fire" button ingame to blow them up remotely. Sort of like a proximity fuse, but using your eyes to gauge that part. you generally only find proximity fuzes on missiles designed for use against aircraft, and i think the SRAW is an anti-armor missile. not sure what kind of trigger device it has, but if it's anti-armor it probably has a penetrator warhead which would imply detonation on impact as the ideal behavior Ouch >  There were some instances in the Gulf War where the Patriot would successfully intercept a SCUD and shred the missile, but leave the warhead intact to potentially still fall on its target. The most recent Patriot variant has shifted to a hit-to-kill technique to avoid this.

this is subtly wrong, which is the most interesting kind of wrong Pretty informative. Thanks.  Where would i find that one?? I just tried searching but no success I dont-fuck with- YOU! not even the Japanesy?  Mall ninja pro logic right here.   One would be shorter than the other and be considered a knife. It would be used if it's really your last option. Also for committing sudoku 
 [Smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2LU-lC-WX0) Mostly to himself.  Ah-ha! I have *another* fuckin sword, you fuckin **BITCH**! It's totally worthless. All of it. Especially this.  Yuuup... 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Reign_(comics)

IIRC the "Dark Avengers" were Sentry, Moonstone pretending to be Ms. Marvel, Cannibalistic Mac Gargan Venom pretending to be Spider-man, Bullseye pretending to be Hawkeye, Daken pretending to be his dad, and Osborn in Stark armor as the Iron Patriot. 

And then he declared war on Asgard. Which was in Oklahoma at the time...

Sometimes comics just get really really silly.  Yeah dude it was a pretty good time for comics. Lots of interesting spins on the archetypes. Thanks! But that's not the one... It features the guy in the gif and has the genji ultimate voice sound over it. Thank you! I know this isn't the one that OP was looking for, but I have been for a while.  lol that was great If a katana can SPLIT a BULLET, I think you can katana your banana with out a worry. Doesn't look like an AA missle to me. AA are usually thin and long.   That's not an AA missile it's an ATGM Story behind it was that someone shot a AT missile at a chopper and it went through the side. So he decided to test it and went into the editor. He chose the Titan at missile since it is wired guided and did that shot.

Its basicly a setup of a shot that did happen.  Its based on a true story, it happened in game and op was like oh this would make a badass picture I believe it is not a guided missile, but I'm not sure. There is only one launcher (in the base Arma 3 game) that is for AA. The missile also shoots very straight, which may or may not be a valid point (when locking on, trajectory changes to where the aircraft is, but I don't think I've ever seen locked on misses for something staying in the same spot.) 

Additionally, there is no square/diamond lock on icon (maybe no cross hairs though?)  You should see a doctor.  Like wow, look at the detail on the rocket head. It's great.  I'm still not convinced it isn't real.  I only play pilot in Arma 3 and I still get shot down on occasion. It's a pretty bad feeling if you know those 20+ guys have been waiting for 20mins only to get shot down on approaching the lz. It's a mix of brainfart en squadleaders that demand a lz that's closer to the AO I guess.

  Depends entirely on the mission/server you are playing.  Nope. Its a steep learning curve when ever you  start Arma. The community is nice from my experience though. Guys you can go and play Squad. r/squad Imo, Squad is a good balance between the realism and tactics of Arma and the crazy fun of battlefield.  I like it more than either battlefield or arma, especially when playing with a good group of people. Holy shit those pilots just fucking ate it, hard. Was it designed to shred the cockpit specifically? God damn.  President Plutonium? "Mr. Putin, highfalutin,

Opposition executin',

Gas reroutin', world pollutin',

Crazy KGB recruitin',

Crooked, lying, fact refutin',

Harsh injustice institutin',

Rival shootin', Mr. Putin -


What's with all the persecutin'?"

Credit goes to u/Poem_for_your_sprog shit they found my account  Just an international witchhunt to bring those responsible to justice. Tends to happen when you down a **civilian plane with a missile.** That would make them too overpowered against aircraft in the game. They had to nerf the SRAW a few times because it was already so good without any sort of manual detonation. And as u/meowtiger said, it's also an AT launcher, so it was never meant to be used against aircraft in the first place. The SRAW has not that capability in real life It is penetrator indeed Can you explain how? I'd like to learn more. [Here you go](https://youtu.be/H9bddoFShKc)  SODOKUUUUUUU Yeah, I admit "largely"  was quite a stretch.  >Which was in Oklahoma at the time

I was with you right up to here. In WW2 the Japanese were training dogs to run under tanks with katanas to cut them in half. A banana wouldn't stand a chance.  Obligatory "that's what she said" Penis joke! [The Titan AA missile looks very similar to this one](http://imgur.com/a/aA8Bm), but it's actually the AT missile, you're right Phrasing! I think it's supposed to be a wire guided missile because he had to keep his reticle on target... but you can't see the wire so IDK It's a Javelin Rocket. It's fired by laser targeting with a wire attached from the rocket to the launcher's guidance system.  True, they look [very similar](http://imgur.com/a/aA8Bm), not identical He can't see anything, that's the problem. But seriously. The shaders in that screen shot really did make me think it was a real photo at first.  fuck it. I might pick up it the next time it goes on sale. $40 is a little steep to simply try out a 3 year old game.  No, its designed to shred plane, that happens to be the area of the plane closest to where it intercepted the airliner.  Yes Komrade, President Plutonium, infamous Soviet supervillian, shot down American plane. Not democratically elected Russian President Putin. And that's how i died. Two plutonium shots to the back and the back of the head, and then i zipped my self up in a bag and threw myself in the landfill. Do you and President-elect Trump play online co-op? Gotcha, cool, thanks.  MIM-104 started life as an AA missile, specifically one that could detect and engage low-flying bombers. 

At the start of the 1980s it was given a new mission, and with it new software, and it became PAC-1, the TBM killer, and it was shit.

By the end of the 1980s, it became clear to even the Army that it was shit, so it got another software upgrade and its warhead was changed from one with many small fragments (like the Buk in the movie) to one with much fewer big fragments. In this new format, it was somewhat less shit, in that it had around 10% pK in battlefield conditions. A "world first" nevertheless, the first live TBM intercept, took place against an Iraqi Scud-B.

By careful consideration, the Army determined that the terminal engagement was the problem, so they changed the software and got new fuzes. And verily, it was still utter shit.

Fast forward another few years, and the Army has despaired of ever getting the damn thing to explode at the right moment and in the right direction, so they have the PAC-3, which is an entirely different missile, the first one that is hit-to-kill, keeping from the MIM-104 Patriot only the name and a very very bad reputation.

EDIT: it did not, and does not help that the Army would very much like to use this same missile to kill bombers as well. Thank you! Gods work. /r/madlads  [deleted] Naw I was just joking man.  Its actually pretty funny especially when Thor buys the land from a farmer with Asgardian gold. I wish I met a gal who referred to my member like a stinger missle. For many reasons.  Are we not doing phrasing anymore? Dicks and what have you!  Catchphrase! I was thinking IRL anyways, like stinger and igla. Forgot about the Titan in this game, the middles of which look more like a TOW or Javelin to me.  Isn't it the SRAW (SMAW?) that is steerable by the shooter? LAAAAAAANAAAAAAAAAAAA I remembered because when this was first posted the creator said they use the AT missile because it wouldn't explode and because it has the flame trail out the back which looks cooler. can confirm, am blind That's where I wanted to take that joke but then I realized that someone would pick it up if I didn't. It's definitely worth it, even if you dont do a lot of mp like me there are some awesome custom campaigns, missions and mods you can download (armaholic FTW) to expand your sp experience.

You can fight in Vietnam, take part on the D day, or just patrol on a normal day in takistan. Its not just a 3 year old game though... Its gotten several massive overhauls that have changed how certain things act and effected gameplay and will continue to get these for another  yearish.


Its also a sandbox, you don't just have the 99% setup 1% action missions. You have game modes like koth and wastleand, plus a bunch of other mods. Then coop against AI and then milsim. There's a bunch of other stuff too G2A probably has it cheap. Also maybe look into realism groups if that's your thing, or the various game modes in Arma Had it since late Alpha. The game is nothing like what it was at launch. It's been upgraded all around and they're still working on it with 3 more planned expansions. Even if you don't pay for DLC you'll still see upgrades to the core game mechanics. You just won't be able to use the new weapons/vehicles/maps outside of the virtual arsenal. It has one of the greatest modding communities and will keep giving you stuff to do.

I'm not heavy into the realism side of it anymore and I wouldn't suggest realism groups to anyone who isn't interested in that. So my question here is, are bombers somehow more resistant to being hit with a super sonic giant metal slug that they wouldn't want to use hit-to-kill for AA?  I guess maneuverability? "Yeah Sarah, *he's* really thin and long and must have some proximity sensor because he explodes whenever he comes near me" LANAAAAAAAAA! It's based on the Israeli Spike system That's the weapon seen in the BF4 clip in the original post.

The screenshot from above shows the Titan Compact AT missile in Arma 3 Can you link me to some good campaigns? I've had trouble finding good ones There's even a mod to create and battle vehicles  maneuvrability counts for nothing, we're talking miliseconds between detonation and impact.

they are not really more resistant, but only very recently (~2010) has it been possible to hit reasonably accurately at those speeds.

the most recent (read: still mostly undeployed) AA missiles are indeed hit-to-kill. the fragmentation warhead was there to compensate for software and sensors being shit. now they're not-shit (although not yet hot shit), and much rejoicing and minifying of missiles results.

EDIT: I thought I should clarify. it is ballistic missiles that are "resistant" and can't be reliably killed with shrapnel - even if you do hit them, they will just keep on falling, and it's better to try and get a solid hit on the nose than to pierce a TBM in one hundred unimportant places (missiles are mostly fuel tank), maybe missing the payload entirely. Line rider has come a long way.  It's called "Trackmania", not "Truck Mania".

The game is about building racing tracks, not about manic truckers. What would truck mania even be? Isn't that just clustertruck? More at seven r/gifsthatendtoosoon Can someone explain to me why games don't look this smooth to me when I play them even when I'm getting way over 60fps? I play LoL at 150+fps but it's nowhere near as smooth.

Edit: I understand now, thanks to everybody that replied. This is just 30fps with motion-blur. [More, so smooth](https://gfycat.com/LivelyImpressionableAbyssiniangroundhornbill) 

Edit: Yes I know the gfy isn't very smooth, the gameplay is. Sorry! More of this kind of crazyness - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK7Y7zyP_SY  
TIL No one knows about trackmania, everyone loves PF tracks. The fact that the frame rate was demonstrated through a gif just doesn't seem right So satisfactory. Kinda surprised to come into a PF Trackmania thread and not see Phantom Fake posted, so [here it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1-GQsLWiYA) The most famous and one of the earliest push-forward tracks. Yes yes give us smooth Am I the only one who doesn't see the 60fps smoothness in this gif? True 60fps should be much much smoother? OP done fucked up. that's no truck I feel like *this* is what a 3D Sonic game should look like. Just imagine the car as a blue dude running and flipping through the air, and there ya go. [deleted] r/titlegore  [deleted] Apple Maps I missread Trump Mania This whole run is kinda orgasmic  I fuck frogs.
Edit: where the frog is my gold? Truck Mufia "The human eye can only see 24 fps" Headlights on just to be sure What fps is that? Are they using motion blur in game? Or it blues because so many frames?  Truck Mania is my favorite trucking game  r/gifsthatendtoosoon It disturbs me how unrealistically high the damper on angular momentum is. thats how i drive to work Awesome  ̶f̶r̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶r̶a̶t̶e̶  motion blur. You mean motion blur. That's motion blur, not high framerate. I would guess it's around 60-120 fps with just a lot of motion blur. Also, most people wouldn't be able to see the high framerate considering that 60hz monitors are the norm. This gif makes me feel good This might look like it requires a lot of skill.

But actually, this is a Press Forward track, meaning that the only thing you need to do in order to complete it is to hold your forward key. Is there a YouTube channel where I can find more gameplay from this game similar to the gif in the post? It somehow causes anxiety and relaxes me at he same time to watch this gif. when did reddit become 9gag? Hey Sonic Team!

You see this?

You see this speed and framerate?

You see the ramps, and jumps and visual polish?

Do this.  TrackMania* Oh it's this repost For some reason, this warms my heart.  Wait games can be this smooth? Is this for PS4? r/oddlysatisfying This needs to be posted on /r/oddlysatisfying  How do I play this game? This is beautiful.  /r/fuckadame89 I've never heard of this game, but this completely sold me You couldn't really drive a car like that tbh. Im more impressed by the framerate than by the stunts why are my trousers so sticky after watching this gif? I find these track mania posts incredibly uninteresting  This is insane and yea it's trackmania :P I've seen this before. Or something veeeeery similar. I never understood all the hype about frame rates until I saw the difference first hand - it's so smooth! Is this like the new line rider? Damn this game looks like fun, what platforms is it on? But its not 30 fps so its not cinematic  would this be possible in real life That's really cool but where's the truck? Can someone render this at 30 fps for me so my eye can actually process what I'm seeing? Anxiety in a gif Those physics are weird  This is so satisfying to watch I wish my life had this much FPS. Hard to believe that Ubisoft made a game where the frame rate is not a issue 

Edit : Yeap, i should known,  they only publish it.  Thanks  OP is a fucking karma cunt, and I apparently forgot to unsub from the kiddie pool I love how it just perfectly lands at the end. The human eye can't see past 45 fps so 60 fps is only an illusion.  but the human eye can only see 30 fps
**/s** **It's called "Trackmania", not "Truck Mania".
The game is about building racing tracks, not about manic truckers.** I'm going to be that guy but really all you can tell about the frame rate is that it's at or above 30 fps. TIL 60fps are awesome Source? Hold my beer That aint no truck This is how it usually goes down when I'm dreaming about driving cars.... Trackmania Turbo looks insane, but i don't know about it that much. So Smooooooth Am i the only one tilting my head sightly as it turns? Not for me. Chrome's doing that thing where GIFs take approximately the half life of carbon 14 to load. Grr... Holy Moly Anyone tried the update for PSVR compatibility? Thoughts? The motion blur is what makes it Oooh that felt good. This should be on that 'oddly satisfying compilation'. That made me dizzy as fuck I just realized this is basically the sequel to line rider. "Where we're going, we don't need roads" They say Trackmania Turbo is getting VR support. Imagine going through a track like this with VR googles. This is freaking *clean*. I cant get over how realistic this game is.  I thought it was a joke first. The gif was stuttering and pausing until it loaded completely on my phone  I have doubts that this could be done in real life We had these frame rates for years. Ever play podracer on PC?  Anyone know the specs of the computer? Thats how the game looks or its modded AF? I dont know if Im very outdated in game graphics or something, but I find it like taken from the future. >Truck Mania

Truck Mania? A Game about crazy Trucks?

10/10 would play whew, good thing he has his headlights on. As someone who does 911 in Texas this looks like our States drivers ed course Ah, yes. The monthly repost of an impressive Trackmania "justpressforward" gif. I feel like this is what they envisioned when they made Sonic 06 Reminds me of rush from back in the n64 days Apart from some of the first NFS games, the Trackmania series is the only true racing game for me. It captures the essence, speed, twitch and precision, and of course smooth and beautiful graphics. This gif is straight butter.   [Reminds me of this one.](https://giant.gfycat.com/LivelyImpressionableAbyssiniangroundhornbill.mp4) Remember when Playstation 1 came out and I thought, "It'll never get better than this." It's beyond me how people do stuff like this in games. Must have spend some hours if this is even a little close to the ancient TMNation(s?)! >Truckmania

Seven years of disappointment and wasted LP made a sighing sound as it flowed endlessly into AdamE69.

[Revive this magnificent nugget of a game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/228760/) srs question, how do people play this game? it looks like it requires an obscene amount of reflex because it is so fast and uses unrealistic physics. I can barely play an average racing game let alone something this nuts lol

EDIT: Didn't know it just required pressing one button! Interesting way of using an editor.  This would be a good start for a new F-Zero game. I like my framerates like I like my women. About 30 per second. Awesome Nice truck.... I would have said that I'm looking at 60fps, but VLC tells me that this video is only showing 29.97fps. Ah.. one of those hold down forward tracks  i dont understand these maps. they look stupid. its like the track is not meant for the car to go a specific track, but as its all random. wow amazing Thats nothing compared to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiuAH-cqLTo So clean!  I miss playing line rider so much.  More like ' hot wheels stunt track driver' has come a long way  r/linerider A truck driver stopped at a roadside diner one day to grab some lunch. He ordered a cheeseburger, a coffee and a slice of apple pie.
Just as he was about to eat them, three big hairy bikers walked in.

The first biker grabbed the trucker’s cheeseburger and took a big bite from it.

The second biker picked up the trucker’s coffee and downed it in one gulp.

The third biker ate the trucker’s apple pie.

The truck driver didn’t do anything or say a word as all this went on.

When they finished, he just paid the waitress and left.

The first biker said to the waitress, “He ain’t much of a man, is he?”

“He’s not much of a driver, either,” the waitress replied. “He’s just backed his 18-wheeler over three motorbikes.” Like he cares, hes one of those reuploaders to get karma How does a repost with a fucked up title make the front page of not only /r/gaming, but all of reddit? well i had op tagged as "reposter" so make of that what you will OP is unaware of this, look at that post history  This guy reposts so much he doesn't even know the name of the game > not about manic truckers.

So basically American Truck Sim online? Which trackmania is this? And which trackmania is best? [Classic Wally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8P257GMgD4) And it is also about a game which uses one of the most annoying DRM protection which caused many problems in the past. This is what Rush (video game) should have been..... Big Muthatrucka - PS2.  Big Rigs Over The Road Racing Isn't that the game everyone's buying so they can play Totally Accurate Battle Simulator? American Truck Simulator 2016 I feel like it's just TrackMania, but with trucks.  Less flying in the air stunts, but when they happen they're that much more impressive. Thought this was an Excitetruck sequel at first.  Really fun game for the Wii. Ive never understood that sub, every single gif just pisses me off cause they end too soon Probably fucked up after it ended [I couldn't find the exact one, but here's one that is pretty similar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-gM0duBAdg)

[And for those who want to see if they can get sick, here's a more intense one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK7Y7zyP_SY) Motion blur. The fast moving bits are blurred so you can't see the jumpiness. Someone else posted [this](https://gfycat.com/LivelyImpressionableAbyssiniangroundhornbill) gif lower in the thread, and you can see about halfway through where the car is airborne that it's not got a great framerate, they just hide it well. Are you using a monitor with a refresh rate higher than 60hz? Pc can produce as many fps as it like, if your monitor is only 60fps capable you won't see a difference Viewing a game being played vs. actually playing the game give you two different experiences.

Since when you are playing, you are focused on the gameplay. Usually looking at one or two places on the screen... your eyes are not looking through the game, or around the game. You are more focused on what is in front of you.

When it comes to watching though, you're not focused on it as you are when you are playing it. You can see through the video/ gif and see it from a different perspective. 

So it seems that these videos and gifs are playing smoother, but in reality, you are getting the same (or better if you are playing on a 120/144hz monitor).

Next time you open the game... just try not to focus on what's in front of you, try watching it instead of playing it, and you'll find that it's smoother than you think.

Best way to see this is playing a game in windowed mode. Since behind the game is just static, it gives you a better perspective on how smooth the actual game is. Screen tearing and frame timing issues. This video is actually 30 fps, not even 60. The reason it looks so smooth is a combination of even frame times, motion blur, and the fact that 30 fps is an exact half of 60 so your 60 Hz screen gets updated at even intervals. If a game doesn't output frames at even times but introduces a tiny delay a few times a second the result looks choppy, even when the game outputs 150 frames per second. This is why framerate is a bad measure of smoothness, and why the statement "the human eye can't see framerates above 30 fps" is *almost* true under perfect conditions.

It might also be worth noting is that if your screen updates at for example 75 Hz and not 60 Hz, that would make this video look more choppy because the display rate of the frames would not align with your screen refresh rate. So paradoxically a lower framerate screen can produce smoother motion under certain conditions. For this reason a 120Hz screen is the "sweet spot" for watching videos on since 120 Hz aligns with both 24 and 30 fps, which are the most common video framerates.

Another video showing high apparent framerate:
https://i.imgur.com/iJ2GkW0.gifv

Edit: typo That's the motion blur, not that much the frame rate, which is at work here. This gif uses a shit ton of motion blur Turn on vsync and lock it down to 60 fps. That will look smoother than bouncing around near 150, which either causes tearing or inconsistent frame spacing. You will get slightly more input lag, though.

League also isn't going to highlight smoothness the same way that Trackmania does. This gif has a slow moving object at the center, fast moving scenery coming towards you all around it, and lots of motion blur. That looks a lot better than units moving on a field when it comes to showing off smooth gameplay. Motion blur.  There is a ton of motion blur in the above video.
 This gif has plenty of motion blur making it smoother. Maybe your screen is bad? I'm guessing it's because the gif is already rendered so it blends frames together, while your game has to do everything in real time.

I'm not sure though. When you play a game at 60 fps or higher, your  frametimes are more important than actual framerate. The frame counter might say 150+ fps, but some frames will stay longer on the screen than others. This makes the image not as smooth. 

This video looks very smooth because the frames are all paced evenly. They each spend the same amount of time on the screen. It's easier to do this in videos.

I recommend a program like msi afterburner to lock your framerate, since it seems to help a lot with this issue. Frame timing is probably the biggest factor. If the frames' duration isn't perfectly uniform, you can still get some jerkiness despite technically having 60 per second. It's why some games are smoother than others even through the frame rate is the same.

Videos don't usually have that issue, so every frame is exactly 1/60th of a second. Motion blur and post processing.  You're right, and yet you get downvoted. The framerate reported by the codec for this video says 29.97 fps:

Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x404 (16:9) **29.97fps** 1827kbps [V: h264 constrained baseline L3.0, yuv420p, 720x404, 1827 kb/s] Damn I didn't want that to end! How do ppl even come up with those tracks?  That's not 60 fps, is it?

OP's gif is miles smoother. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPMOPgTnOFY) [deleted] That broke my brian That gif looks 30 fps at the most. Definitely choppy. Is that even 24fps? How do people have time to make these tracks? Like I barely have enough time to enjoy driving my real car! [I see your smooth and raise you smoother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K17LqNiCciQ) Ah, good old press forward maps. Canyon looks better than I thought it would. Completely unrealistic driving. [Here's a video and track I made years ago](https://youtu.be/uBJ5M_4vcmY) (no audio due to copyright claim)

Edit: I'll upload another video when I get home.  wait... YOU MADE THIS
 PF tracks? This is the closest thing I've seen all thread about the actual game. Do you, good sir, know the name of this track and how I actually play on it? I've been playing TM for almost a decade but only the built in content. Every time I try to browse new stuff, I can't find anything useful. It's a video, not a gif. 

Edit: 

[Literally a video](http://i.imgur.com/UQRNBsy.png). Imgur will redirect people with browsers that don't support mp4 video playback to a gif alternative, so you might in fact see a gif, but the original posted link leads to a page with an mp4 video.

Edit2:

Also it's a 30 fps video. Give us silky It's 30fps with lots of motion blur. No one said 60, the title says awesome And that's what Sonic Utopia is, a proper 3D open-world Sonic game (currently only a demo) that's actually fun, smooth and awesome to play :)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsGiXBxDL1Q It's a "hold forward" type track. The level is carefully designed for you to hold go and then the car gets thrown through the course  And he called it truck mania Actually, this is a 30fps gif with the maximum amount of motion blur in Trackmania 2 Canyon... This is probably an auto map. You might want to visit /r/confusedboners then He fucks frogs.  This guy fucks.

(There's a lot more, but I can't think of the names right now) This is just 30FPS with high motion blur. But yes, games can easily be this smooth, even without motion blur.  Trackmania Turbo is out for PS4, this one is Canyon, if I'm right, but the games are similar. Lol I just commented that This specific version is PC only. Nadeo is a French company. Ubisoft just publishes it. . . Probably because they only published it. I can definitely tell below 60fps. Over that I start to struggle unless I'm actually playing. If you download the video you can see that it's reported as 29.97 fps by the codec Until you get a 144hz monitor, then 60fps feels like 30. This is 30 fps, it just has a ton of motion blur Except this gif is playing at 30fps, it's the insane amount of motion blur that makes it seem smooth. This video is actually 30 fps :) That's how it looks. It's a push forward track, takes hours to make the track and 1 try/1 minute to complete the track. The only skill involved is with whoever made the track. That's a track where you have to do nothing but accelerate. Very easy to play, really. This is a Push Forward track, it's made that the player only pushes accelerate and the track does the rest, no skill involved in actually driving on this track considering all you do is hold down a single button. http://www.linerider1.net/ That was the shit a decade ago we actually hang out at r/linerider I recently found a copy of it at my local goodwill. Too bad it's shit.  The real /r/jokes is always in the comments. *He ordered a cheeseburger, a coffee and a slice of apple pie.*
A true goddamned American patriot. Eastbound and down, loaded up and truckin'! As a trucker in training this made me giggle. Dang, I heard this before. Mike Cross sings this in a song. Great artist. This is reminiscent of a scene in the original Smokey and the Bandit. What once was old is new again.  Bahahaha. That was incredible Loyd!!  So what happens in the movie?  The trucker wrecks their bikes and gets away with it Scott free?  No, in the movie they catch up with him a half mile down the road and slit his throat.  It was a good one. All I took from this: who orders a coffee with a burger? Gross. Serious question. What motivates people to be reposters and karma whores? > reuploaders

You must be new here 'Algorithms' Idiots upvote anything from the defaults I noticed a big spike in karma farming reposts with typos hitting Tue front page after that LPT about intentionally making mistakes for attention. Can't find the post to link. Not that it's even a great framerate, it's just got enough motionblur that you don't notice it. And every time it's this few second gif being reposted instead of the full, more amazing video.

can't find this exact one, but here's a similar one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QweZzejPcU
 I have him tagged as 'shitty reposter' Look at the 2.7m submission karma. He is a dirty karmawhore and he knows it. It's Trackmania 2 Canyon. My personal favorite is Sunrise eXtreme I have the same question.  Is this the Trackmania United Forever or the f2p one? Trackmania 2 Canyon, Trackmania Nations/United forever. Big Rigs 2 - *Now Optimised!* I always preferred Big Mothertruckers 2: Truck Me Harder Truckmania #47 100% anal Was it just me or was that game actually incredibly difficult?  #"THE TRUCK'S FUCKIN' THE GROUND!" This seems to be an "accelerate only" track, basically just holding the gas button the whole track. Probably not. I'm pretty sure this is one of those 'just hold forward' tracks. You can see in the first 3 seconds it's not got a great framerate..  Motion blur is also the reason that launch games for new consoles are often race games.

Easy to make them look good and smooth while actually not being good looking and smooth. This a thousand times.  The motion blur is way more impressive than the frame rate here.  

 And high refresh rate. When I played Q3 competitively I ran it at 333 fps with a 200 Hz CRT monitor, smooth as fuck. [deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3677 If you have a nvidia 3d ready monitor, it might have a setting called lightboost that usually only gets activated during 3d mode, but by using a special program that I forget the name of from blurbusters.org you can activate this setting outside of 3d mode and it totally gets rid of motion blur it's awesome. Lightboost basically flashes the backlight of you monitor on and off really fast which mimiks a crt monitor, eliminating motion blur Plus most people use 60Hz monitors which can't display more than 60 images per second. That's what playing on consoles is like. If you put your hand in the middle of that gif obscuring the car, it looks like it's going at ludicrous speed.

Likewise, if you cover the surroundings of the car with your hands, it looks like it's not really fast at all Actually even with a 60 Hz screen, while your screen can only update 60 times per second, higher fps (100, 200, 300 or however high you can go, the more the better) will still feel far better than 60 fps due to frame latency: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjWSRTYV8e0   This gif is not running at 60fps, you know. It's the motion blur and post processing that makes it look so smooth.  This reminds me of a time when a friend of mine (computer science major) was arguing with me that you don't need a 144hz screen because your eyes can't tell any difference whatsoever 60vs120v144hz screens. I just got my first 144hz screen yesterday and oh my god what a tool he was This is the correct answer. Ah yes, when a game runs at 200fps with a 60hz/75hz monitor.

I wouldn't be surprised if people said that the screentearing is beneficial because the 1/120th of a second timing difference is something that throws them off if vsync is turned on.

Right up there with motionblur enabled and a 4:3 resolution stretched for a 16:9 panel being touted as game enhancements. it is never true. Quick question, why 29.97 fps? Why not just make it 30? It almost didn't. Here's the actual video if you have 5+ minutes to spare:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPMOPgTnOFY Trial, error and a lot of free time. I imagine they make a ramp, play it, see where it lands, go back to edit track and put the next piece of track there, repeat. I'm not familiar with the track editor though so that might not be 100% accurate. It must be very time-consuming but rewarding. [deleted] Might you say it's....street ahead? 5 mins 49 seconds well spent Most tracks involve steering and skill, like most racing games. But there are a lot of people who make 'press forward' tracks like this, which is a class all of it's own Not here, there are 2 ways to be good at the game, either as a Driver, or a Builder, a good Driver can pull shit like this (ok, a bit less extreme) off on normal maps, and a good Builder will build a Map like this where you just hold down a Key and magic happens. Poor Brian... I can't imagine it's anything higher than 50 fps.  I called bullshit too, downloaded and checked, it's 29... Nowhere even near smooth Can your car do a frontflip?
 Well, there's your problem. You enjoy driving your real car, and that takes time away from this. nice little track there :) ...yeah :3 Press Forward - basically just hold the accelerator and let the track do the rest. The OP's track I don't know of, but the one I linked requires TM unlimiter for TMNF. that's what I suspected It says awesome frame rate, 30 fps is not awesome. [deleted] How do you plan these tracks out? 100% a press forward map. That man is a frog fucker. *He wants to fuck a frog in the ass...* frogs Frogs ... why the fuck don't I have a PC yet? Not all heroes wear scarves.  *-rubs hands together-*

[Let's see if I still got this.](http://i.imgur.com/3jtGfUI.gif) I remember playing a version of it on my iPod Touch was the best game ever

Found a video I made 9 years ago ha!

Made a better version
https://youtu.be/OpI8l-9M-q8 The real /r/LifeProTips are always in the comments. The real /r/circlejerk is always in the comments. Next he's gonna orchestrate a coup against a democratically elected South American government, like a true American patriot. We gonna do what they say can't be done! I thought I recognized that joke from Smokey & the Bandit.  Are you a driverless car? I think it would be cool to have a PC gaming rig in a semi cab and team drive. Truckers gotta get their caffeine and protein in the same sitting It sounds pretty good to me, especially on a long drive. Do you drink coffee regularly? They like numbers going up, I think it's fuckin' dumb personally. They sell the accounts. Insecurity and need for acknowledgement. Probably attempting to fill a void inside themselves my using a number to measure their self-worth. Honestly, the website is so big and so much content gets posted you would be surprised how many people can miss a popular post. More exposure for posts, personally I try not to repost but there are times I just don't know and I do it accidentally. I do cross post, but I just enjoy sharing things I think are really cool with other people that I think would enjoy it too.  yeah, they don't upload shit, just relink to it. I hardly upvote anything... Is being a casual user really idiotic though? It's not like people put a whole lot of thought into clicking an arrow when they like something. The gif is 30 FPS, so there's nothing "awesome" about the framerate.   I've never played this game, and i'm thinking is this really live gameplay? Or is it just recorded using the games own replay system or what? [The craziest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXVAI1Choks)

[Best one ever made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK7Y7zyP_SY)  
Comments say it took two years to make and I believe that. What's the point of accumulating that much karma when everyone knows you did it like a bitch? I loved Sunrise, didn't know they made a successor to it. Still play nations occasionally, has controller support and play it on my Steambox. 

A blast at 55 inches! This is TM2 - Canyon. There's no 'best', but most people are on either united forever or TM2 - Stadium, which is exactly the same. Using reverse gear doesn't break the speed of sound #**BIG RIGS!** [The first one was just so amazing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBcjobKbXHQ) I can't believe I live in a world where that's not considered good frame rate. My home computer can't even play Octodad. And the camera work Try the last gen panasonic plasma TVs.. super sexy smoothness. It's an outrage that they had to stop making them. I want to play it, but I know I'll never be able to accomplish half of that... unless the game is using some preset invisible boundaries that allow your car to perform that we'll...  Or playing new games on my 6 year old GPU.  
(I just looked it up: it came out 6 years and 4 days ago. Maybe it's time to get something new?) And potential screen tearing, which is not a better feel. It's a terrible feel. Yeah sure, tell that to the 5 different frames my monitor tries to show me at once when i go over my display refresh rate. "jif" 

unwatchable.  He is not a doctor, why do you expect a computer major to know the refresh rate of human eyes. Yup. And your eye can't see the difference between 1080p and 4K either, apparently. no the correct answer is this has a ton of motion blur. like a shit ton. Also good to know this isn't live gameplay footage but rendered from the built in media tracker in Trackmania, so no wonder it looks like this..  V-sync delay can be as big as 50ms on top of what is already probably ~50ms on a standard gaming machine with a 60hz monitor, or at least, that's what many input lag tests show.

I do audio and shit, and having more than 10ms total round-time input lag throws me off-beat.

The numbers don't make sense to me as they aren't 1/60, but that's what I've heard/seen. Idk man, vsync input delay can be really bad sometimes. [Standupmaths video on how 29.97 fps originally came to be](https://youtu.be/3GJUM6pCpew) The NTSC analog TV standard used 29.97 fps for some [reasons](http://theautomaticfilmmaker.com/blog/2009/2/23/about-frame-rates-or-why-2997.html), so it's a legacy thing. You're right that there's no reason to *render* a video at that framerate though.

 It's sort of like how we say a day is 24 hours, but it's only just 23 and some change.  The thing about Trackmania is that the physics engine is completely deterministic. So if you build a map such that a car's out-of-control flipping just perfectly lands it after a jump once, it will do that every time, as long as you drive it the same way.

The way you drive these maps is to hold forward and never let go. That's exactly how I do it. I tried to make one once and after your track is 20 seconds long it is absolutely tedious work. The map in the gif probably took a quite a while (hard to tell but i'd say 10-20 hours is on the low side).  This was my thought. Build what you need while not fighting cause and effect in-game physics then come back and fill it in. I'm like 90% sure OP's gif is higher than 30. This one definitely also has motion blur  Similar to the "do nothing" levels in super mario maker. wait.. so can you play on other people's tracks? That's sweet!

"Call me when you're done with the track Jeff, I expect a challenge this time" Don't worry he'll be back in like two episodes max, that other dog sucks Nah, I am good.  Best I can do is 23 fps. man you're right I frickin hate my car now  Try googling for them. There are some crazy, insanely intricate and compact tracks that boggle the mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OMeDgGP4uw Also know as auto levels in other games You build 1 short part.  
Test.  
Build another short part.  
Test.  
...  
Repeat. It takes months to build long tracks with a lot of flippies and dippies I'm thinking that there are 2 ways

1) painstakingly resetting/building

2) some type of trajectory path dealio during "build mode"   Make a bit, see where the car goes, make more, see where it goes, make more... It's fiddly work. You get some really cool results though, like this.  Basically you just observe where the car flies and then put track there to catch it. Route the car via track that won't cause it to flip, then put something to cause it to leap (a ramp, a bump, whatever), then repeat the process.

The car really is flying randomly, it's just our brain fills in the gap and believes that because there's more track afterwards that it was an amazingly skillful jump.

And even when we know the trick (hold forwards, which will create the same set of variables every single time), it's still fun as hell to watch. The dude fucked a frog... You tell me my friend. They're easy to build, same price as consoles, have metric shit-tons more games, it's then a PC for literally anything else, and they're just better.  Join us You might even say most don't.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVZSqtBwj3E [Here's mine from 8 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qoztiilWYI) That frame rate though. The true /r/demonssouls starts here. The real /r/circlejerk is always in the comments. Should have added an "LPT:" to make this a self fulfilling prophecy!  We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there. Negative, I am a meat popsicle. In a similar comment thread someone wrote that these folks can eventually sell their accounts to internet propagandists who want to look legit in the community (like when the online Putin army was active). I don't know the truth of that but I found it an interesting thought. Like that new Black Mirror episode.
 It's simple:

If you give credit to the person you took the post from it's OK, otherwise go die in a fire. I guess you're not an idiot, then. same here, upvoted I mean, awesome compared to the usual 12 FPS gifs you see. "Most awesome rate of frame!" - OP That's live gameplay, but the track is a self playing one in which the player just holds the gas and the car will make it to the end. That's choppy live game play that is smudged put so you can't see the edges unless you pay attention.  There's a non-insignificant number of bots who are serial reposters to big subs like /r/gaming, /r/funny, and /r/pics that accumulate huge amounts of karma, then delete their history and sell their account to corporations who then use it to advertise.

The accounts are usually banned shortly afterward, but there's actually money at stake. Well, I'm sure you could break speed of light if you tried long enough. 30 fps hasn't been good frame rate for PC since 1996. You realize that most tvs that a advertise "200+ hz"  just duplicate and/or add black frames? You aren't actually getting more information. Its just displaying the same information more often.  you're supposed to just press the gas and watch, these types of courses are set up solely as eye candy. These were pretty rare back when the game came out but most of the tracks are these type now. It's just abusing the games physics to max effect. Definitely time for an upgrade. I usually upgrade GPU's every three years or so.  I experienced the worst screen tearing I've ever seen the other day. Got Crysis and during an apparently FPS uncapped cutscene I was getting over 2,000 frames. Holy sweet tearing Batman...... Being in veterinary school (close enough) I tried to tell him that's not how it worked This is true though, when distance is a factor (pretty obviously if you're 100 yards away you won't be able to tell 4K from 640x480) Adding on to this, if you download the GIF and go to its properties, it says 29 frames/second. Yeah, but vsync lag is largely dependent on your video card and possibly your monitor. It's not a sync issue at that point, but an input delay issue.

So *every* frame experiences x amount of lag initially, but it's not like every subsequent frame is x later than the last.

And the numbers don't add up because a frame at 120hz is onscreen for about 8ms. I spend a lot of time gaming with a lot of people who play rhythm game, shmups and fighters and generally speaking, when actually put to the test, most people cannot reliably tell the difference between a 1f and 2f delay at 60hz, I sincerely doubt people can tell that same difference or less at a higher frequency (120/144hz).

That's why I made that comment. There are other factors, like initial delay (lag) due to hardware but to actually be affected by a sub-frame difference is an absurd proposal because it's outside of human limits. A much more reasonable complaint is being visually jarred when your game's framerate drops below the monitor's refresh rate. Adjusting to that smoothly is why freesync/gsync was invented. I literally cannot play games with Vsync. I bought a Free sync Monitor just so I never had to touch Vsync again. I will watch any Matt Parker video posted.. even when I've already seen it. 29.97 seems to be the default setting in some programs (notably adobe premiere). But it definitely looked like he turned a bunch in this second gif, which confused me. I was certain it was higher than 30 fps, so I downloaded it and ran fraps.

Nope. Solid 30. Let me just call a friend. He's an expert on these kind of things. The levels were pretty well made but man,  that dubstep was atrocious. I'm a stupid fuck. I should have never been a sheep. Will I have to do the walk of shame before I make the greatest PC ever?  But some do. holy shit Haha I know I cringe everytime I look at it This was the most entertaining and creative for me, OP. I'm glad Luigi won!

 Yay! I'm going to celebrate by making the sparks when I put a fork in the wall holes! /r/rocketleague is eyecandy regarding framerate. That reposted Thor rolling a joint from yesterday is like 1.5 fps hahah Yeah i kinda figured that out, it's just really strange seeing a racing game with no HUD  Einstein was wrong. I seem to recall people doing just that You would accelerate to a 32bit integer overflow of 4,294,967,295mph while the speed of light is 671,000,000 mph.

This means you could probably get to about 5.5 times the speed of light in your little truck.  Plus you need a TV with DVI/DP, the TVs usually have input lag problems and high response times. I'd love to upgrade, but my student loan won't cover it. But can it run Cry- oh, never mind  I was playing Crysis 1 the other day and I had to put vsync on, the tearing at uncapped was waaay too bad Which one? The car turned because of the way it hit the edges of the track. That's just the car swerving because only the left or right wheels are touching the ground. Wow, the other one must me like 15 Wow. That is some solid post processing then. It's what I call the "I am a small gaming YouTuber and don't know why I'm not getting any subscribers" formula. Even included the 3D text intro.  Yeah I love EDM but I could not listen to that song with the gameplay.

Actually, most online trackmania servers have horribly spammy huds that fill half of the screen with server/world map records and bright colors. Its not really live gameplay, its recorded from a replay (which is why there is no hud).

For example, this is a video of when i played it a while back and i did the race, went into the replay editor and turned up all the graphics and then recorded: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAEIW0FH8LY Not only does God play dice, the dice are loaded.

Is it ill fitting pants? Many of these subjects in the gilded post are overweight, is that a cause? Shirts that are too small? What is the god damn problem?!

Edit: My chubby buddies reporting back. My apologies, I didn't know it was such a nightmare for you all. Now I feel like the ass crack. Anyone know the cosplayer's name?

Edit - I may have [found her](https://www.instagram.com/rio1917/), even though I don't see OP's picture there.  I found the Instagram by looking at Imgur after trying to find the album where the pic was posted.  Found [this profile](http://imgur.com/user/Rio1917/submitted), which led me to Instagram.

Edit 2 - It looks like the D.Va pic was added in the time since I posted.  Yup, found her. Glad to see Miranda Cosgrove still having fun Her eyes look dead. Popular video game + female cosplay + neckbeard butt crack + meme reference = perfect storm of Reddit karma.  Devout supplication to the hairy, man ass.  Whoa, that's crazy. If this is Baltimore, I'm pretty sure this is the one random person I took a picture of.

And then every other day, there's some top post about it here on reddit, months after release.  I guess its OK to body shame - as long as its a man you are body shaming.

Edit: now here come the down votes to hide the truth.  Doubling down on the hypocrisy. So when I hear cosplayers complain about creep shots, I will show them this one. I am sure she got permission to take this picture?  Reddit loves body shaming people No cracks required! She isn't looking into the camera 😣 In all my days as a wearer of pants/shorts, I've never understood how this happens.

[Reddit post #2 of all time, under that rice guy.](https://www.reddit.com/top/?sort=top&t=all) He looks like fat Jon Snow.  Holy shit, how am I just now seeing this? I'm still laughing This guy's pretty funny. I asked him one day if he still does it. He said "I don't pray anymore. " I'm still amazed he was banned from the event for doing that and then unbanned just from the roar of the internet.  It always amuses me that one fatass Magic player felt the need to humiliate a ton of other fatass Magic players on the Internet... and then reddit being reddit a bullying post made it to the #3 most upvoted post of all time. 

And just yesterday one of the top posts on /r/all was all about how schools turn a blind eye to bullying... loool.  That's exactly how I always imagined a Magic the Gathering gathering would look like. Sometimes stereotypes exist for a reason. Is that a chubby Chris Pratt? Look what you started!

http://i.imgur.com/xhhiSYi.jpg

Unless you're more referring to the expression... But that's kind of unfair nitpicking. I think what you're getting at is a lot simpler than that. Shes supposed to be looking directly at the camera.  Oh, is that what the original was supposed to be?  I always thought it was some sort of "and here is our deity, the buttcrack, let us worship" type thing. Fat people have bellies that usually make it impossible to wear pants at their actual waistline, forcing them to wear them under the belly, thus leaving less pant to cover the crack. 

Can confirm, am fat.  Shirt isn't large/long enough. Can confirm, am a bigger guy and wear long shirts.

(Sometimes it's from pants being too small as well.) I am unable to get pants that go both over my butt and around my waist properly, even back when I was slim. Pants just aren't made for men with long and large butts. My pair from old Navy have to be pulled up high to go over my butt crack, but then split my testicles in two.  I just want to know how it goes unnoticed for so long. I've got a gut on me and am aware of the epidemic. Whenever I sit down I adjust pants and shirt because I don't want to end up on the front page of reddit. How do these guys not at least feel a breeze?  I have a very long ass crack, dead serious Richard Lundgren. Damn nice investigating. God's speed. Then she is staying faithful to the original post. I play video games and I'm dead inside.

It's an accurate cosplay of a pro gamer. It's was like 100+ degrees outside  > ~~Popular video game~~ + ~~female cosplay +~~ neckbeard butt crack ~~+ meme reference~~ = perfect storm of Reddit karma.

To be fair the original had ~38,000 points I thought it was from this weekend at Otakon at BCC too. It looks like the balcony thing where they do photoshoots.  Can confirm, was Otakon at Baltimore, crossed paths with this girl many times. He received an 18 moth suspension which has since expired.  Fact of the day, the plural of Grand Prix is Grand Prix. And he got banned from all sanctioned Magic, from FNM/prerelease up to the Pro Tour, had he been qualified.  Well, the character is from a popular game (Overwatch), and the original post comes from a Magic the Gathering tournament, which I'm not sure is included in this subreddit  This is the most upvoted post on /r/funny 
https://m.imgur.com/a/SjcgE Personally I'd stick my finger in her butthole She's a character in a video game calls D.va.

Well in up skirt the "photographer" has to go out of there way to get the shot,  where in Crack shots the "victim" is shamed for lack of consideration of social norms  Indeed I've partied with this guy a many. He's a really nice dude and a can spit some sick rap. I had two videos on my phone of him rapping at a house party we threw. Fresh Breeze Movement for life! Columbus represent!  No, D.va is a fictional character, it is who the lady is dressed up as, D.va is from Overwatch   thicc af Don't worry love.  That guy probably couldn't recognize himself. Wow if the game had a dick, how deep would you say it would be in your mouth? Fucking settle the fuck down, Blizzard marketing guy. It's because blizzard made it, no blizzard games have ever done badly and all become pretty much part of game culture. Everyone knows about wow, diablo has huge fanbase, starcraft is still referenced "you must construct additional pylons, zerg rush etc". Same with Bethesda games, Overwatch wasnt gonna be different.  Remember when everyone said that the only thing that could beat WoW's numbers would be *another* Blizzard game and people dismissed the idea? Fast forward to 2016 and... Pokemon is all over the top posts though. It didn't beat League of legends (maybe in the launch) but atm lol is far a head.

What you are refering to is net cafes... net cafes don't make even an 5% of the player base in Korea or anywhere else. This just in: all of Reddit is a single person. Nah, I think it's fine to body shame everyone equally. > why is this still a thing, you are literally just making fun of other peoples insecurities.

It might create some insecurities but it's not mocking any right now. 

>If these weren't fat men the internet would be outraged about this kind of joke, but for some reason that makes it ok.

This is true. Show pictures of women's buttcracks would be seen as creepy and no one cares if you mock a fat guy. 

>Didn't the guy get banned from magic tournaments for doing this?

18 month suspension and he was apparently a tournament organizer for his store. That probably screwed him harder than just a tamp ban. 

>and still people don't see anything wrong with what he was doing?

He wasn't doing anything wrong. He didn't show anyone's faces. No one wants to see dudes buttcracks. 

I play magic, and am a big white dude with a beard. I could probably cosplay as this guy with little effort. 

I always have a hoodie with me to hang over the bad of my chair so no one see my buttcrack. I wish more people would do the same thing. 

He was bringing awareness to a minor inconvenience that is easily solved but because it got popular Wizards decided to take action as it was bad PR. 

If he had shown their faces or used their names then I would agree that he was harassing people. If my buttcrack was online I would be just embarassed enough to bring a hoodie but not enough to want him banned.  Other people insecurities? They just need better belts. The haters are just jealous cause they lack the crack.  If it weren't "fat guys", people would be upset?! No they wouldn't be, them being fat has nothing to do with it. Pull up your pants.  > Especially ones like this where it's just the same skintight suit

Do you even know what D. Va wears? It's either this, or these girls need to start building mechs to cosplay in. Somehow, I don't think that's very affordable. I'll need to see more to know if I am sick of it. He probably just copy-pasted. u/ibleeedorange is a chronic shitposter. It is known.  He copied it from the girl in the pic own imgr less than 10hrs after she posted it

[Like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua20Hxx8xDE) happens to us all You had one job  Your good posts with good titles are far too rare for the sheer amount you post to reddit  You fucked up big league. Or should I say fucked uped big league. Twice  Many years ago I got interested in Magic and went to a local card store that specialized primarily in Magic cards.  I started talking to the owner and another employee about getting into Magic.  They asked me what kind of deck I was thinking of making and I said something dragon-themed would be cool.  They looked at each other with these huge smirks as if I'd just said the stupidest thing they'd ever heard and started laughing (not belly laughs, more like evil minions laughing to each other after their overlord says something 'funny').  It made me feel really stupid, and I could feel myself turning really red.  They never shared what was so funny, but after that they treated me in a way that clearly stated they were no longer interested in interacting with me.

I tried a bit longer, mentioning that green decks seemed fun since they seemed to be my style of play (buff up monsters, trample enemy).  I asked for confirmation if that was a common green deck strategy and they just snort-laughed and said "something like that."

I left shortly after.  I felt really bad, even though I knew they were the problem and not me.  Haven't touched Magic since.

I know not everyone in the hobby is like that, but when even business owners that depend on new players for increased business treat you like shit for being a 'noob' then I figured I was better off avoiding the hobby.  Saved me a lot of money, too. I stopped playing Magic when I realized I was starting to become that guy. I've started playing again with Eldritch Moon but I'm sticking to being a casual player. Amen Competitive MTG players are just the worst. In my community there are a good bunch of guys and they will help you, but there is a whole different kind of bunch that are just assholes.

I was pretty proud when on turn turn 2 I killed the mutavault of one of those asshole, he wasn't too happy about it. Let's be honest here. I'm not sure if it's a majority or a subset, but a large number of MTG players are just people you do not want to be around. Local stores vary, but large events tend to be places you do not want to hang around for too long. /r/magictcg is one of the worst subreddits you could step foot in.  18 months. I'm the Reinhardt that shouts "WITNESS ME" and charges it off the cliff. *remember my sacrifice* Or you see the ! ahead of you and think "ha! there is a wall between me and it" and then find it is currently flying over that wall, and is now on you. D.VA main here. They are adapting. If anything it just clears the point for my team. I don't get kills cause the majority of folks scatter like rats. Still useful just no points. I'm usually right next to on the objective because my team are kill whores... Play More Zarya. Dva ults, and most other ults, just become your best friends for gathering charge.  That's why you play Zarya. D.Va and Junkrat ults are so easy to absorb. I love absorbing all that sweet sweet damage with a barrier. Now if my barrier is on the CD that's another story. I'm not super competitive, but after the patch that adjusted her shield and Ult, I think she is much improved. Yes she's a very competitive pick at high ranks. In pro play she's still somewhat niche but the tank roster is overall very balanced from a competitive standpoint. Pretty good off/secondary tank. I usually stick to zarya though.  She isn't a good solo tank, because reinhardt is better at blocking, not a hard flanker because Winston is more mobile, and doesn't deal nearly as much damage as Roadhog or a good Zarya, but she is a GREAT off-tank. 

Her defense matrix can easily fill in for a downed Reinhardt shield in a pinch and can shut down ults like mcrees or pharahs. Her boosters can catch fleeing enemies, allow her to retreat or attempt to flank snipers. Her ult is good area denial too. With a second tank there to help catch flak she is great. I have the most luck with D.Va and Zarya when to comes to being a balanced offense/defensive tank. Reinhardt is best for me for defensive She disrupts teams that can actually work together. Try charging in with her and pray your team does something with it. The charge knocks enemies around and damages them. Then just keep drawing fire with your shield while your teammates finish them off. You're going to lose the mech this way but hey your teammates should have picked off 1-2 of them right? RIGHT? She's become a great tank after her recent buff, yeah. Funniest part is he got banned from MTG I think as a result. Yeah, it always cracks me up too. [Rap album cover version](http://i.imgur.com/77Pk1cz.jpg) Sam Tarly x Jon Snow Dinner is coming. Fat Jon Snow is a legend. The King of Cracks!! Really? Reddit shows me as number 4.

http://imgur.com/a/XB4GG Post #1 and #2 are not from default subreddits (and have thousands of upvotes more as well), check /r/all for the complete top posts list. I suspect given his weight that he's plumbed a few people in his time too. [deleted] He was unbanned? Never felt like an "LOL they're fat" thing just that they lacked the ability to not show their collective ass cracks to the world. More like public shaming for being gross than bullying to me. Yeah, never was about being fat. It was about improper hygiene and care towards  one's personal self. I do struggle to understand how people find this funny.

What's so humorous about a guy taking pictures of people's ass-cracks? Seeing as how this is the top post on r/all right now which refers to me I'd say that that was a pretty safe bet. Whenever the original dude is making the prayer hands, I think those are the funniest. Also he's got this like, sweetness to his eyes that pushes the comedy over the top.  Ever consider wearing suspenders? That's why you gotta learn the chub and tuck. I'm skinny and I struggle with it. I don't have hips or an ass to hold my pants up! A belt only does so much! "Can confirm, am fat." Fucking hilarious. Don't you realize that your ass is hanging out n pull it up? Look up extra length t-shirts. Yeah I'm a skinny tall guy with a big round butt. The problem is that most modern cut/slim fitting jeans are actually made to sit low, below the waist, in the first place; so if they are sitting properly in the front they aren't even close to making it around my J Lo sized butt. Long shirts are a must, but again being tall and skinny makes it tough to find properly fitting shirts as I need a medium for a modern fit, and they usually aren't long enough. Luckily, they make extra long undershirts so at worst I'm exposing some backside undershirt and never crack. 

Though in OPs photo this is not the case, that is just a fat guy in a little shirt.  If you notice most aren't wearing belts. I'm a fat guy myself but sometimes even with a belt it happens. > Richard Lundgren

I just imagined Richard Lundgren on the phone saying: "Dolph! Dolph, it's Richard. Your cousin, Richard Lundgren. You know that new cosplay you're looking for? Well, look at this!"

I'm sorry, it sounded hilarious in my head. she is a pro gamer, so she probably did play some mobas

and as we all know, mobas have the most unbiased and welcoming communities on earth

man, dunkey was right about league then why not look at the camera like the original post did?  probably more since it decays. You are correct, it is. Saw it in the Otakon group earlier today. > 18 moth

Your comment could apply to any of the 3 million blizzard white knight fanboys in reddit I'd personally have Overwatch's dick in my mouth 24/7. This is one of those advertisement posts they were talking about.  Heroes of the storm begs to differ. Growing up, the 'Blizzard' title was the only one i would look out for.

And that was in the 90s. Well yeah. It's Pokemon!  No, it's still beating League.

On the back of all of the news with various top esports teams picking up top Overwatch players, and the Overwatch World Cup being announced, comes news that Overwatch now has over 15 million players globally.

Industry analyst Daniel Ahmad reports the following about Overwatch's success:

This makes it the fastest selling PC game of all time, surpassing the previous record holder, Blizzard's own Diablo III. 

And about those numbers in Korean PC bangs? They're still beating League of Legends by a sizable margin (and growing). " As is tradition. It's u/IBleeedorange, of course that's what he did.  Or did he..... creepy pastad It is known. Looking at his profile. Oh god, he might embody everything wrong with reddit... -_-' It's a shit title anyway. I have a typo in my RES tag for him. He is known as shitposer and I'm not changing it. idk, /u/ibleeedorange posts a ton of content, a lot of it is amusing, and I'm pretty sure I've heard them say they try to avoid reposts. I like 'em.

Hook, Line, Sinker. Yeah people like that are assholes.

Honestly the way to get magic is to have friends that play magic. I can't imagine trying to get into it without playing at the kitchen table first - probably MTGO would be the best way there. But it's also expensive :( [deleted] Eh they were just some assholes, there's tons of local stores that would be willing to help you start out.  My game store is always nice and willing to help new people out.  If you were still interested, probably the easiest way to get back in is to pick up a couple of duel decks (blessed vs. cursed is really fun) and play against a friend I've played Magic (very) casually over the years. I think you'll find people like that in any sort of hobby. The elitists that think they're just amazing at the game and that they don't have time to deal with new or inexperienced players. I personally haven't met anyone like that with Magic but I'm sure they're out there. I never attended any organized events or anything.

But honestly most of the people that I've met, which was mostly through high school and college, were friendly and glad to help. I've sat down with complete strangers and asked if I could play with them and I've never been turned down. I've had deck building help from guys I just met.

You also have to remember most people that play Magic aren't exactly socially skilled.  Comic and gaming shops are the fucking worst. I've been to a bunch of them, and not once have I ever been to one where the owners/employees weren't a bunch of sweaty pretentious assholes.

Edit: Nan's in Houston is OK, but the whole store smells like BO. I always assumed it would be difficult to fuck up a comic book store's business but I guess that's the way you do it > I know not everyone in the hobby is like that

not everybody, just most of them.  Magic is an awful community.   It's a hobby where you spend hundreds of hours reading up on meta and the cards, then thousands of dollars buying cards that all match that meta, so you can win, just like all the other assholes who end up "staying" in the hobby.

They were laughing because dragon cards are generally pretty shitty.  In Magic, you win by spawning infinite squirrels in some stupid combo.  They though of you as an inferior being for not knowing that trivial knowledge of a dumb hobby. 

IMO, the only way to enjoy magic as a "normie" is to play preconstructed decks vs other preconstructed decks.  Eh reminds me of video game veterans too.  I've been playing the same MMO since it came out in 2001 and some of the people are such elitists and jackasses to new players.  They don't realize they're riding an old ship that's destined to sink and they're making sure no one new climbs on board. Just *imagine* the self-loathing those Magic guys deal with every day, and appreciate that they drove you away from the hobby. Something worth noting about these "business owners": half the time they don't actually care about the business, they just started a card shop so they could play.  I'm not talking shit about every card shop, there are plenty of really great shops out there.  But there are also a ton of terrible shops that don't give a damn about anything other than competitive play. Never seen that kind of behavior from a store owner. A few players but not even that many. Honestly that's pretty idiotic.

Yeah we have some idiots. They were probably just really good blue players (blue's strategy is to annoy your opponents until they lose all desire to play, or something like that) Damn. Wish you were in my area. When I was getting into magic I went ahead and bought 100+ cards, cus why not, and I then went the shop. I told them I wanted to start playing and I already purchased cards, and they were so nice saying that is a good way to start, but can cause confusion for a new player, and such. They were amazing people. I am sorry for your experience. I live in Snellville, GA, and the place is ~~Tabletop Games~~ Pwnd Gaming, if anyone is wondering. Idk why they're laughing, edh commanders has a decent dragon deck. I'm sorry that happened to you! I enjoy Magic and still am pretty involved, but it does attract a certain group of people. Regardless the game can be really fun! I'm sorry some asshats ruined it for you. That's a really shitty attitude  I'm sorry you had to go through that. When I was playing mtg on a daily basis (1998-2003 I'd say) we "veterans" always tried to be helpful with newbies, pointing out strategies, giving away cheap cards for them to get started etc. We even went as far as pointing out when someone was trying to scam them into a very unfavorable card trade (got a couple death threats out of that). We had our fair shares of assholes in the community, but in general it was quite pleasant. I'm sorry to hear it has gotten worse over the years.  Those people are assholes, but I'm going to try to explain what I think they were probably laughing about.

Most dragons in Magic are high mana cost creatures and while they're powerful, a deck based around them is usually not going to be very good (outside of EDH where higher mana costs don't matter as much) so they were laughing at the strategy I guess.

And with Green decks, you're right. They play big creatures, buff them, attack, and often have the Trample ability. That being said, a monogreen deck generally won't have as many tricks that other colors have available, and is an easier deck to pilot for a beginner. 

So, it seems like they were laughing at you because you were new, which is crazy considering you would have been a paying customer at their business.

If you're still interested, check out /r/magictcg and maybe find another game store in your area. You can also get Duels of the Planeswalkers for on Steam. The newest one is free as well. They can help you to learn the basics of the game, but don't have the same level of complication as playing on MTGO or with paper. Kitchen table Magic is best magic. Get friends and enforce Pauper rules (no rares or above, or was it strictly commons?) so that no one gets any bright ideas and goes out to buy their way to victory. My man! Welcome back to the fold. :D

Relevant story: Some smug jackanapes dismissively called me an Effing Casual while asking *everyone else* in the room if they'd go to an upcoming Pro Tour Qualifier a hundred miles away at the weekend. Everyone said 'no', but i said "Yeah man i'll see you there".

Dude couldn't make it (nobody wanted to waste a car seat for him) but i went along with some other marginally serious players.

Went 5-0 before my first defeat, with a borrowed deck, then it all went down hill. Still, worth it to see that guy not say anything to me when word got around.

[\#EffingCasualForLife](http://thinkingmomsrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/fist-in-air-male.jpg) Got into paper magic this year, superfriendly people at my store i actually made three good friends from the store. But i have seen my fair share of dicks in IQs and PPTQs. Ymmv i guess..  relevant username? is r/magictcg the subreddit that avidly defending the literal convicted rapist magic player over his crazy aggressive rape?  and continued to do so even when numerous women in the community came out and said he acted massively inappropriately around them?   Best feeling as Reinhardt until you realize your shield would just block most of it Im the roadhog who would accidentally hook the meka as a reflexive action and get half the team killed. You stay, I go. I prefer CATCH PHRASE! I'm the roadhog who hooks it into the entire team. I'm the Mei who blocks the explosion with a wall. One time I tried to do this but accidentally just brought it to my team in a ranked game. People were not happy.  "You will ride eternal, shiny and chrome." You are credit to team. I managed to grab someone once while doing that. Once I grabbed someone, I was like "YES!"... and then off the cliff Just drive it to a corner and shield the blast. Zarya main here, pair up with one of us and you'll wipe whole teams when we combine our ultimates :D TBH, I thought this was a post about a Democrat from Virginia.   To the point where she's dominating quickplay if there is more than one of her. Comp, yeah she's fine. There's the single hero limit.

Quickplay.. oh boy.. Multiple D.Va's are a pure nightmare. I expect there might be some balance changes in the future.  Plus she's cute. Yeah, Zarya is the most offensive tank with a weapon that kills other tanks and a shield that makes said weapon stronger. She has 8-second vulnerabilities, though. So her strength is largely in the trigger discipline of her enemies and the cooperation of good teammates.  Lately I've been ruining the game for Soldiers/Mccrees/Pharahs/Roadhogs by stealing their ults with my defense matrix. It feels so good, but I could only imagine being on the other end. You don't play her as a tank. You use her for her mobility and 2 lives to annoy the hell out of people. one or two years ago the ban was lift thou That's fucking hilarious. 18 month MTG ban for taking pictures of peoples' asscracks. What's the fine for cameltoe pics? Funniest part was that a post on /r/funny was actually funny. The MTG community is becoming *super* sensitive.  Owen Turtenwald, probably the best player in the world, is disliked by many simply because he is frequently curt.  

That's it.  He speaks plainly and honestly and doesn't pander to people with silly puns and over-the-top niceties like other MTG pros, so they dislike him.

These people are becoming/already are the majority, so Wizards of the Coast bend over backwards to appease them. I laugh my ass off every time. Ok. The love child we deserve skylarmt linked the top of his subscriptions (or the subscriptions of whoever clicks the link), you're correct that it's #4 of all posts. i never realized just how many upvotes that bill wurtz video actually got until now. #5 overall, that's wacky TIL that going to top>all time still limits to subs you're... subbed too. [/r/all/top](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/)

EDIT: and #2 is my favorite "top post" We didn't, reddit oh, 18 months go by faster than I think... The ban was never permanent. It was only an 18 month suspension. Yeah, your ass hanging out is an easily solved problem. Loose fitting cargo shorts and a tshirt that's too small for your chunky body. At least wear underwear. Thankyou for your service.  God's gift to the fat guy.  But you can't wear them in most casual situations.  *cries tears over pizza* Thats a belts only purpose.  Dunkey was part of the problem.  He was banned for being part of the problem.  He quit because he's a manchild who couldn't handle that he was punished for being a shithead and actively making the game a worse place for other players on a regular basis. He was part of that problem too. Because some people apparently thought he was praying and completely missed the joke of his contemplative gaze into our souls I mean if he's into that sort of thing why not.   Yes, [but the best he could hope for is 2nd place](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/2016/08/12/michael-phelps-goes-for-gold-rio-olympics-100m-butterfly-live/) is her butthole dangerous or something?  When you nerf this but /r/SheStillSucking...

(NSFW) That's disgusting. I'd hate to have my finger touch something that so many other peoples' dirty fingers have touched. That's the spirit  He will pull his pants up? I think it's starting second lap already. You mean esophagus well its an amalgamation of all the IPs thrown into a genre that other games do better, so nothing really unique about it to remember Fuck Heroes of the Storm, and Fuck Overwatch for being the primary reason for why I say fuck Heroes of the storm. 

The game was fun until blizzard fucked the game up with dumb Overwatch heroes that completely destroyed the game for a lot of people. 

 Well, it's not doing terribly. It just hasn't taken off like hotcakes. Read the entire article and still don't beat lol, lol had around 32 million player base in 2014 before the servers of Brasil/LAS/LAN/Africa/South Africa/Japan.

http://majorleagueoflegends.s3.amazonaws.com/lol_infographic.png

Net cafes means less than 5% of the player base... As is tradition. Amen copying pasting crappy potised Mmmmm. Creepy pasta.  tbf so is rooonaldooo99 You can't deny it now. Some say it is written /shillmodeengaged

ibleedorange is actually really good at being involved in most of the communities he's engaged in (I mostly see it in the Blizzard game subs, of which he's a mod of at least two). Of the shitposters, he's one of the few good ones. [deleted] >I've heard them say they try to avoid reposts.

Correct, I run everything through karmadecay.com and/or through a reverse image search of reddit from google.

 u/pitchforkemporium This guy fucks.  He fucked up twice. GET THE MOB! Please begin. But it makes the title unique and artsy... Fun facts: The dad is dead and the chick is now a dude. MTGO is the absolute worst way to get into Magic, friend. Forget expensive, MTGO is awful software. Lots of nice digital card games out there at this point.  I've only recently started getting into MTG and hope this isn't true everywhere. I've only been to one draft but the owner and the other guys at the LGS seemed pretty cool and were pretty helpful. They did talk about other stores having a lot of elitism, so maybe I just got lucky where I went. I draft every Friday and I've never really had a problem except for a random kid who had some sort of developmental issue, and he wasn't really an asshole, just very easily distracted. Really depends on the store though. 

Compare that to LoL or any FPS where you'll eventually run into raging assholes no matter what you do. Something about saying shit to people's faces. > but the whole store smells like BO.

You didn't need to add this. That is just how I imagine most game stores. At a local primarily mini-war gaming (40,000K mostly) store it got so bad this summer they put a poster on the door telling people to fuck off if they haven't showered. Some people just don't understand that casual!=bad player just like how some people don't understand that there are people who will buy a box of boosters rather than buying singles even if it's more expensive for potentially less value because they enjoy opening packs.

Good job going 5-0 btw. How many people were there? I've never gone to a Pro-Tour qualifier. Yeah but that requires your teammates to know to stand behind the shield; easier to get it out of the way so the headless chickens can continue to run around. As a D Va player the last thing you should do as a Roadhog is hook me in. Sometimes I save the ult just for it. No following. Whereas I am the Mei who sits next to it in an icecube... To quote Tom Fawkes, "HELPING!" Zarya could combine her ultimate with quite a few other ultimates. Pharrah, for one I love dropping a Zarya ult into a Mei ult, then watching any other damage dealing team member getting those phat mops (cleaning up)  Ouch.  I play shittons of Zarya these days (damn you Mercy nerf!) and the amount of D.Vas that absolutely refuse to communicate when they're about to ult... it makes me sad. Usually the voice chat goes like this:

"Zarya ult is ready, if someone wants to combo, tell me so we can set it up!"

*silence*

"Okay D.Va, I see you have ult, wanna tell me when you use it so we can combo?"

*silence*

...and then D.Va just uses her ult whenever she wants and gets no kills. Fine, I'll just try to see the future and see if I can Graviton Surge where you seem to be aiming your ult ಠ~ಠ  Hah, when I can get my 6 stack together we always run full D.Va.

Chaining ults on the point to keep it clear will never not be funny. What, roadhog isnt? Tbh all those guys are so easy to waste ults. Winston, Reinhardt, DVA, Roadhog, Widowmaker, Mcree, Mei, Ana, and Hanzo call all either block, stun, or OHKO, soldier/mcree/pharah and mcree, roadhog, Ana can shut down roadhog. Its crazy. it was never lifted, it was an 18 month ban from all tournaments and he served the full length of that ban and it finished a few months ago >What's the fine for cameltoe pics?

It's a MTG convention... 

 18 months. We actually know this because someone was taking pictures of cosplayers and making fun of them on Twitter at a large tournament. Banned. > What's the fine for cameltoe pics?

I believe it´s more like a reward. Finding a Black Lotus on the tournament floor would be easier than taking a cameltoe pic at a MTG tournament [deleted] Buttholes What blows my mind is that of all 25 on the top page, only 2 are older than 1 year! I'm here for 3 years now, I've seen 23 of those 25 post happen life. Not to mention events like the fattening that I also witnessed and aren't shown there.

I basically lived through most of Reddits interesting stuff.  Heroes never die Not with that attitude. Just be a hipster and wear plaid shirts. Suspenders always go with that. Get American flag suspenders and DARE anyone to tell you that wearing them is wrong. What about if wear them under your shirt? Like over an undershirt, maybe. Can you not do that? Every day is business day... [removed] Lol I agree. He is funny, but his lack of self awareness when got banned was a bit much. Unless he wasn't being serious and he was just trying to make a quitting video for the views, then the joke's on me.  i agree with you that he did act like a dickhead, but he's literally doing what everyone else is doing. If riot was actually dedicated to stopping toxicity in their community, they would put an actual system that rewards players for being nice rather than allowing players a limited number of recommendations to give out to friendly people and an unlimited number of chances to report them too.

They've been "making examples" out of popular celebrities by banning a few of them personally because of their behavior, to make it looks like they're actively fixing the problem. The problem with this is, you're basically saying "It doesn't matter who does this type of behavior, we'll ban anyone that does something like this." It's very noble and a good idea, but you have to actually follow through with what you've said. It's like when China banned lady gaga from entering their country ever again because they visited the dalai lama. There are probably a shit ton of people in that country that have done the same, but china only cares about looking tough.

And another thing, dunkey has been through that rodeo of being treated like shit multiple times before. He's been partnered with machinima, who screwed his channel up good, polaris, who straight up lied to his face about paying his machinima contract fees, youtube screwed him over multiple times, and so on. He just had enough and quit.

And besides all that, his next video had a joke of him making fun of himself on how he quit league. so, spaghetti and meatballs.

TLDR; NOT EVEN CLOSE BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY I loved his vids but it is really hard to get even a chat ban in that game IMO r/nocontext You mean stomach What do you mean by the last part? Didn't they only add tracer and a widowmaker skin? We're not talking about overall players, we're talking about people actively playing. Concurrent users.  Are you fuc.

Easily over 25m karma between these people  Also in his defense, I've never had an issue with him in /r/CFB. He's genuinely active and engaged there. I tend to dislike when accounts go for the pandering title but, typo aside, this one is pretty accurate.  [deleted] I think people just have an instinctual negative reaction to seeing the same name under a lot of front page content, but to me, that shows you must be doing something right, so keep on keeping on! I don't mind your post because usually they are very good, but I need to ask why? What is your motivation to be so active? Can I get torches there too? I'll take three, one for each cheek in the photo and one for op You know, I've actually been known to fuck myself The haters. [...Huh.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/how-the-internet-failed-jessi-slaughter?utm_term=.sleJ6y0pz#.ohRPzaERe) It is very hit or miss. I loved my buddy's LGS, but man competitive Magic players (especially the bad ones) are just the absolute worst.

Playing Magic casually is the best way to play. Unfortunately I can't do anything casually - I go hard and then I get bored. You got lucky.  Store magic is mostly very unfriendly to beginners.  The exception is when there is either a very large beginner population where they can learn together or there is enough of a laid back atmosphere that it can still be fun.

Tournament magic is a completely different beast than FNM or an offbeat draft.  You have so many people there working towards a singular goal that it kind of loses it's social atmosphere and becomes more of a workplace.  I personally didn't like it but I do see the appeal.

If you can find a place you like to play and/or people you like to play with, enjoy it!  It's a really fun game, don't let the toxic atmosphere elsewhere detract from your fun. I hate that this is literally the experiences I've had. I haven't gone to my LGS in quite a bit because the last few weeks it's been pretty rank in there and I'm sick of leaving with headaches. Well, while our experiences differ, I will provide my own anecdotal counter argument. I have,  in all of my life, never seen, been to, or even heard about a store that smelled unless it was from other people on the internet. Nor have I run into asshole LGS Owners or even players really. Sure, a few people got a little upset unnecessarily, but I haven't seen anyone be straight up rude or dickish.


Every LGS I have been to has been helpful to new people, they are prospective customers after all, and are fairly consumer friendly.

If anyone knows any horrendous places in the San Antonio area, I would gladly have you prove me wrong. That's why you just get the whole team to play as Reinhardt. You just push up and get riiiight on top of that mech. Like brushing the front of your shield on its face. You can block almost 180 degrees of the explosion and the bar is set real low for what counts as being "behind your shield". Why?  1/3 of the time you are always missing the ult by 20% like everyone else Funniest ult chain is junkrats wheel. Ever seen 6 of them coming for you? It's fucking terrifying I was able to get a round with 3 other bastions and 2 healers the other day on rio as defense. They weren't able to get out on the truck and move it since we just bullet hosed them as they stepped out the doors. Roadhog is sexy af Yeah they're called moose knuckles there. With men we call it a moose knuckle.

 Also the fullest beard you can grow. 

And brush up on your Unix tips.  But it is wrong. It breaks the US flag code. Before you downvote, this is what Dunkey typed to get banned I dont think people got the joke with that one.  >his lack of self awareness when got banned was a bit much. Unless he wasn't being serious

When mirrodin first came out I went to the pre release at a local hotel, 3 days of tournaments and you got to keep/win a lot of cards. I was about 15, this super fucking hot chick came in and I just about broke my neck. The guys I was sitting with started laughing and asked if I wanted to meet her. Of course I said yes, well she comes over and had a voice so deep I thought it was James earl jones. Come to find out she was actually a transvestite, I never went to mtg related events ever again.

No thank you. That image will... haunt me. Where the fuck is that dude's penis? We pulling an r/thanksobama? Dye your hair white. Start writing a series of books.

Perfect, I love this place.  Thanks. Ok I've got my pitchfork... wait, why is everyone talking about... 

ugh I'm too late. It was fun to have that happen, but it would get old fast even as defense. We got our karma on the next round though when they were defending the same map and they had us pinned just about as well with a bunch of firepower focused on the spawn doors. IIRC it was a bunch of attack and deffense characters staying in motion so you couldn't just pop out a couple times to kill them like you could with a Bastion. Those were some fun rounds and good teams. Well did you hit? I bet you're one of those guys who would turn down a million dollars rather than suck a dick.

Thank Mr. Skeltal 🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺 🎺🎺📯 Noot Tee Shitpost, /u/bausse, shitpost! It would be great to make a fedora in a rpg, with the description telling that it increases your charisma stats while it actually lower them. Nintendo knows, I guarantee it M'Trainer  Reddit: Be yourself! Be what you want to be! Don't let anyone tell you what you can't do!

Also reddit: don't you dare put on that fedora you fat neckbeard virgin fuckface Carefully placed in trash can so it can be retrieved again. Gingerly places 3ds in garbage for picture after laying out clean paper towels over garbage. [More fedora tipping](http://imgur.com/a/91ysv) Well I don't see the 3DS doing you any favors, even as much as fedoras get shit on.

source: am 28 y.o. and also own a black N3DS Damn, I was just on my way to pick up my brand new 3DS XL and copy of Pokémon Sun. I recommend a Fez, Fezzes are cool! M'ature Literally unplayable.  trilby's are not fedora's. 

[This is a fedora](http://www.thegreenhead.com/imgs/genuine-indiana-jones-fedora-hat-5.jpg) ...But they look so cool when you pull them down and they cast a shadow over just your eyes. Weird, this was literally my memory on Facebook for today... From 3 years ago.

https://sli.mg/CdHxEg It killed me that trilbies were the only hat choice on Melemele in Sun and Moon.  [The trillbys in SuMo aren't too bad](http://i.imgur.com/LhpEzT8.png), but I'm sure not going to buy it lol. Absolutely unacceptable! ...


...the word she was looking for was *euphoric*  M'udkip [SWAG IS FOR BOYS, CLASS IS FOR MEN](https://youtu.be/JUVOgPzXm7g) I suggest the fedora.... it makes them panties drop... /s This highlights an annoying conundrum I'm encountering lately. I looked up recommendation for stylish hats to go with a dessy-casual outfit, and a Trilby supposedly would look really good with my facial structure....

How do I wear one without looking like a douchebag neckbeard though? *takes picture*

Haha not really...

*takes ds out of the trash*

I need that Fedoras are still worn commonly in Japan as a fashion statement. Old af meme  Fanservice that's called LOL JUST KIDDING 
*COUGH,COUGH*
Shits expensive  Not to sound like a garbage picker or anything but if you're throwing it out, I'll take it.... I just started playing, but they actually call a trilby a trilby, so this lady isn't talking about the neck beard hat. I'm just imagining you setting up this picture, gently placing your 3DS in the trash, making sure it doesn't sink. You can tell he put the DS gently in the trash lmao I bet it took a while to find the pen when you took the DS back out I like to picture how carefully they put that in the trash. O.    M.    G.  I did not understand that joke, first time ever (online), i will regard this day as the one i realized i  getting old :'( You can can fedoras trash all you want but have you seen Patrick Stump IN YOUR LIFE?!?! He is HOT and wears a fedora regularly. [picks the 3DS out of the trash and dusts it off]  "Well now, let's not get ahead of ourselves..."  I find it funny that someone took this picture and most likely went to pick it back up from the trash can I believe the only person still allowed to wear a fedora is Notch.  Whoever thinks wearing a trilby or fedora is a good idea is just setting themselves up to look incredibly stupid, especially if you aren't actually wearing a suit of any kind.  I will never understand fedora hate ...m'lady ^But ^I ^like ^fedoras...  http://i.imgur.com/AvFwydp.jpg

 I created an account because of this post, just so I could unsub from this kind of trash. I like fedoras damn it! Why the hell do all of you have such a problem with it!?! whats the deal with fedora hate?
are meaning to say that by wearing a hat i am instantly a terrible person? It can if you wear it with the the appropriate attire. Man, this fedora thing is way overblown here. I didn't even know there was a stereotype about fedora-wearing neckbeards before I used Reddit. Maybe they are excited that Fedora 25 was released this week! M'lady. My girlfriend would appreciate this post more than you could ever know. Lmao this is too much for me Well, they do know their target audience  Tips fe-Oh... Unplayable  How is it that the fedora became the Nickelback of clothes? Literally unplayable. Matt Bomer pulled it off. Also makes you 10% more gentlemanly [This has probably already been posted in this thread but...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlxfDvSyPKA) Fedora is a Linux OS too. M'trainer I'm sure this was true once r/justneckbeardthings  So fucking old. Old meme *Tips fedora*
M'lady Bonus points for it still being the same room in Pokemon while in the trash. Fedoras have always been wack. The only things that go good with a trench coat is a suit and nice shoes that make a *clack* sound when you walk on concrete and a trilby. Other than a suit trench coats and trilby don't go with anything else. M'fedora. /r/justneckbeardthings  the perspective on that bin is freaking me out, is it just weirdly shaped? My neckbeard is triggered. Knew I wouldn't have to scroll down too far to see comments mad that he clearly didn't actually throw his handheld away, and it was just a photo set up to help the joke. DED. Hey hey hey. Keep the game. I just want the 3ds. There's so many people who have 2 or 3 and I can't afford one.  no where is safe They're right, though. Trilbies on the other hand are neckbeard cancer in hat form M'moon I wonder if that's Jensen or Matty Booms laptop? #killmewithafedora Wow, two year old repost M'lady LMFAO 1 fedora per group you know the rules M'Lady M'ature Didnt know pokemon masters were into Linux Damn, this is old.  pafect This is the main reason why Gen 6 is the worst /s You could say that's one canned response. Burn the house down. I would like to come collect your trash please!  Its okay guys. It said fedora not trillby. The world is safe. Reminds me of action films and the way the hero always manages to plunge off a building and land in the skip filled with shredded paper and unaccountably clean cardboard boxes instead of the one with food waste and dead raccoons. I don't understand a joke. You should really not just throw out electronics. Please recycle them responsibly! I don't get it, explain please ? Is it me or does it look just like a glowing cube in a bin? M'choke Guys we have to bring back the Fedora. [Indiana Jones](http://www.indygear.com/images/gear/fedora/bts/ToD-fed.jpg), [Leonard Cohen](http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/ffximage/2008/11/21/leonardcohen_narrowweb__300x487,0.jpg), [Dick Tracy](https://rodapedohorizonte.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/warren_beatty_as_dick_tracy.jpg) even [Secret Squirrel](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/hanna-barbera/images/2/23/Secret_Squirrel.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090511025604) wore one, and they looked great. Nowadays people confuse the [trilby](http://www.hatsandcaps.co.uk/images/products/large/138899.jpg) with the [fedora](http://unisci24.com/data_images/wlls/18/232756-fedora.jpg). It makes me sad. And into the tissue-soaked semen bucket Maybe they were suggesting an actual fedora and not a damn trilby. Nope, there's only trash here. As a proud fedora tippin' neckbeard, I am offended. 

But creddit where creddit is due, good meme.  They do look rather fashionable, when paired with a suit anyway. If I knew how to mod, I'd do this for Fallout 3/4/NV Once, in a d&d game, my party went into a clothes shop to get winter clothing. I asked the DM if there was a fedora in the shop, and he led me right to one. I got my character to put one on, and the DM made me take psychic damage as a result of the shame. Maybe also have it increase the aggro you draw from intelligent enemies. or just make it the most powerful item in the game so people has to wear it. Im going to put this in my rpg, thanks Why can't I think of clever shit that makes me chuckle like other people  on the internet can? It's not fair... or wait maybe it's totally fair, and I'm just worthless. Oh yeah, I'm just worthless, sorry. Negates your base defenses as well.  I played an RPG where you could get the hipster scarf. It made it so enemies attacked the hero wearing the hipster scarf first. Golden. Ubisoft/Massive  can handle that trick for you.  Watch Dogs 2 has some fedoras with pretty funny names that poke fun at the wearers. I'm just conflicted because I don't wear them but the protagonist is in the 1% of people who can actually pull one off hahaha M'nintendo. My grandpa wears one and looks like a fuckin boss. Not sure why Reddit is so butthurt towards em. Weird.  The closest I can think of is [Nethack's fedora](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Fedora), which does nothing. "This Fedora makes you feel stylish, but everyone secretly mocks you behind your back. +10 to defense because your enemies will be laughing too hard to fight properly." Adding to my game now Clearly a cursed item. There was a transgender chick in this game. They definitely know. The localization team isn't that subtle about it.  M'achamp To train them is m'cause. M'aiq the liar Ironically M' is the way to say My ______ in Irish, provided the noun starts with a vowel.

*Eg. My dad = M'athair* M'Ledian M'udkip [M' Charizard](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/%27M_(FF%29) Well to be fair, I think the reddit point of view is, you're free to put it on, but it makes you look like a neckbeard. Which is true. Still, be yourself,and reddit will remind you what you look like.  Neck beards actually wear Trilbys, not fedoras. But I want to look all smart and distinguished.  My wife bought me a fedora, and likes it on me. I'm going to continue to wear it, because I like her more than internet randoms.  But yeah, I find the hatred for a hat very strange, and now I end up worrying that I'm being judged any time I go out wearing a gift from my wife.  Fedoras aren't even that bad, most of it is Reddit confusing fedora and the people who normally wear them. I personally don't like them but I don't think it makes you look like a loser. It's the fucking Gi with a naruto headband that does that I wonder how Reddit feels about Bowler hats. Also also reddit: Dear god man, get yourself to MFA It's almost like this is a multi million user platform with different people who have different views on things. The Fedora/Trilby hate stems from the misuse of the hats by wearing them with clothing that does not fit the styles. People who can pull off wearing these hats possess the following traits:

1. They wear suits or sport jackets with the hats.
1. They wear dress shirts, not t-shirts, shirts with graphics, or polo shirts.
1. They wear slacks, not jeans. Yes, a dress belt is required.
1. They wear dress shoes, not sneakers, sandals, hiking boots, or crocs.
1. Even when hatless, they resemble mature distinguished gentlemen. Sorry, kids, angsty teens, and baby faced college students can't pull it off. [deleted] We are just trying to help But it's already too late for 50% of Reddit :( A simpler rule is do not wear a hat for style until you are at least 30 It's almost like Reddit isn't one person I think it just points to how clueless guys are about fashion, and what women find stylish or sexy about style or their bodies.  >  Be yourself! Be what you want to be! Don't let anyone tell you what you can't do!

This only applies if what you want to be is what we want you to be. What if you wear it with a suit? If not, then how about a bowler hat? |  fat neckbeard virgin fuckface

Oh my Just because you're yourself doesn't mean we have to like you.  Trilby* are you normally offended by fashion are you normally offended by fashion Just don't wear a fucking fedora. It's not that hard. Be whatever your heart desires, but we will judge the shit out of you for it. [^(HEY NOW... i'm not fat. the neckbeard fuckface part however...)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMW5ZAwgGxD/) *puts on fedora*

Yea you like that you fuckin retard? Can't have our expensive 3DS touching our week-old cum tissues. I have the NES special edition one. No shame. 
 That's Pokémon X and Y. Sun just has sex jokes in it And a bow tie!  Nah, I'm over fezzes. Now Stetsons, Stetsons are cool. There are lots of different styles the come from different eras, too. Indy's is a 1930's style fedora. The hats from the 40's and 50's were different and kind of cool in their own way. 

And of course, it's less about the hat and more about [the man wearing it](https://imgur.com/a/amwSB). Apostrophe's are not for plural's.  Suits and matching clothing, not ripped jeans and My Little Pony t-shirts.  Wow thank you for that.  For years my hate has been directed towards fedora's for no good reason.  Fucking trilby's.  Common 2016 can't you at least take that too? Here's the thing. You said a "trilby is a fedora." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is an atheist who studies euphoria, I am telling you, specifically, in atheism, no one calls trilbys fedoras. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you should too. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "fedora family" you're referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like myself. So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people "say that only neckbeards wear fedoras?" Let's get Mountain Dew and Doritos in there, then, too. While we're being pedantic, the plural forms are trilbies and fedoras.  You'll be pleased to know that in Pokémon Sun and Moon they are indeed called Trilbies. It helps when you're a kawaii anime girl. In this moment, something something Everyone knows Arceus is a lie! He sounds like a Rick and Morty character "I'll slit your throatneck"

Percy means business, tbh fam. There's no such thing as a hat that doesn't make you look like an asshole.  I have only ever really seen them on old people.

Looks great with someone wearing a full suit.

So many cool hats in Japan I just son't think I could pull off. Didn't see a single one in my 3 weeks in Japan this month. Two games ago  Wouldn't it be weirder if they actually threw away a $200 console over a hat instead of selling it? > Most likely went to pick it back up

How.. How stupid do you think we are..? I think Matt Bomer gets a pass.  Cubans can wear them though. I don't know why It's because they are worn by acne-ridden, know-it-all virgins with no social skills and penchant for My little pony. It's because there are quite a few people who wear a fedora with fucking blue jeans and a t-shirt while thinking they are the pinnacle of fashion.   They just fucking suck and dont make any outfit look more mature or classier.  Hey hey

you wanna

you wanna know a secret?

*leeeeeeeans in*

^nobody ^cares Neckbeards.  You either have trilby and fedora confused or you're just wrong. Eirher of them are bad options You should make a really good mod then sneak it in  "(puts on Fedora) 
...

*Piper hated that*." Well, you see, the difference is that the hats in that game are paired with an appropriate outfit, rather then cargo shorts and a too small xxxl t-shirt From the very little i know about modding fallout nv, this would be an extremely easy mod to make. Like, literally less than 10 mins of work total.  Good I now want to try purchasing a fedora and placing it on someone else to see how my DM reacts. That's a good DM. new character build, Hat Flinger, you fling fedoras onto people's head to make them die of shame! God, get beasties  I would have locked it to your character and removed 20 speech/charm/intimidation and disadvantage on all speech checks. 

I haven't played D&D yet   Permanent disadvantage on all charisma checks and saving throws. All NPCs avoid speaking to you if at all possible.  Intelligent? Pfft those are chads... Make the whole neckbeard's outfit the most powerful armor pieces: fedora, trench coat , etc.   And you have to have all pieces before you can enter The Friendzone.  It grants weapon mastery:katana.  Don't worry buddy, I'm sure if you were sold into slavery you'd be worth a couple thousand. 👌 Happy cake day! Wait, what? In the new one there are not-so-subtle innuendos how the Prof. bangs or wants to bang your mom and much, much more. Chrono Trigger did it first! Wait is there? If its a spoiler past the aether paradise invasion just say yes.  M'reep M'champ* M'agearna [deleted] [deleted] > but it makes you look like a neckbeard.

Probably because they're trying to wear with the jeans and a t-shirt. I think if you are cool enough you can pull off a fedora. It's pretty hipster. I think only on reddit it has taken on this new connotation. That being said I would never wear one. Unless your the swaggy old cuban man on my block, it's hard to imagine him WITHOUT the fedora. This. Neck beards know the difference Here's the thing. You said a "trilby is a fedora." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is an atheist who studies euphoria, I am telling you, specifically, in atheism, no one calls trilbys fedoras. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you should too. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "fedora family" you're referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like myself. So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people "say that only neckbeards wear fedoras?" Let's get Mountain Dew and Doritos in there, then, too Underestimated comment of the day. Something legit I learned from a costume designer I used to work for, glasses do exactly what you described.  She wore fake ones purely because it made people assume she was smarter, and I'll be damned if it didn't work.  Just as long as they're stylish and not BCGs, you're golden.

Hell, Jeb Bush does it, so there's probably something to it.  Edit: Or he *did* it anyway... Have you tried trench coats and newsboy hat? They achieve a similar cringe while offering a wider surface area of coverage.  [deleted] She's making sure no other women ever find you attractive again.  It definitely depends on how you wear it. If you're well groomed, clean, not morbidly obese, and dont have an obvious obsession with my little pony porn, you should be good. The neckbeard/brony stereotype definitely ruined a perfectly fine hat.  Also it's not that the hat itself is bad but the large number of "Intellectuals" who wear them seem to fit into a nice convenient stereotype that's propagates itself with their attitude that they have somehow transcended others in all things. M'Gentlesir. Yeah I mean you probably are being judged by someone... but to be fair, people are judgy and would pick something else even without the fedora. just gotta SHAKE IT OFF!! SHAKE IT OFF!!  I think it's safe to say that anyone is definitely a loser if they wear a naruto headband. I've known two people in my life who wore Fedoras. Both of them were completely insufferable. Even before I knew about Reddit I couldn't take anyone with a Fedora seriously.  Talk shit post fit Tldr: buy boat shoes you mean im not schizophrenic!? This is one of the most obnoxious, clichéd comments on all of Reddit.

Of course Reddit is made up of lots of different people with lots of different opinions, but it's still weird when two completely opposite views are seemingly held in equally high regard by one population.  Thought it was just the two of us and I just thought we could make it if we try just the two of us you know you and I You forgot must have well groomed facial hair What is dress shirts? What makes them different from other types? Not a native speaker. [I disagree with rule 5.](http://i.imgur.com/B4hqkXc.jpg) I think the real hate towards the neckbeard type people was to combat the stereotype of reddit basically being anti-tumblr. Hence the sudden rampant support for the SJW mindset, and the abrupt shift in religious discourse on the site. Now you can't even mention that you're an atheist without immediately getting downvoted and declared a fedora tipping shmuck. And child abuse. And dealing with grief after a fatal car crash. And probably more.  And extremely dark Pokedex entries. HGSS had a couple with a very... Sexual team. An Onix and a Cloytser. Bow ties are cool.  >And of course, it's less about the hat and more about the man wearing it.

And also the accompanying clothes. Wearing a dress fedora or a trilby with blue jeans and a t-shirt just doesn't look good. You can kinda make it work with a dress shirt and vest, but whether that'll come down to your own attractiveness. But as part of a good suit, they're great. That's not a man wearing it, that's a legend. m'g-nazi How about uncommon or rare 2016? I mean, to be quite honest your hate is still kind of misdirected. It's just a hat. lol doesnt matter really what they put in it, unless they were intending to make fun of neckbeards. 

Was mainly just responding that most people seem to think a fedora is a trilby, thus any type of fedora is automatically associated with neckbeards.  I put hella effort in to make sure I match my Arcanine. That's not true. Wear a sombrero. You'd look like more of an idiot than an asshole. It's a seasonal thing.

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/233k7o/eli5_whats_the_hate_with_fedoras_over_in_the/ You sound like you write Urban Dictionary definitions. Hmm, none of those things fit... Anyone... I know that wears a fedora.  This, while being a very simple-minded view, is the most realistic opinion I can see for this. That's a very dumb and wildly aggressive opinion. Huh? Oops I was thinking of a porkpie lol Sounds like a job for /u/spez I'm currently developing a long quest mod similar to Milkman and Bounties for New Vegas, I think I might secretly put such an item into the game... I coughed up my soul laughing at that one. That's basically Fallout 4. Ballistic weave modifications are the best armor, but is limited to items like the fedora and minuteman outfit (a duster) if I recall correctly. No make each piece terrible the the set bonus reverses the terribleness into the best in game. Tfw a properly fitted, high quality trench coat can be one of the nicest coats you can buy 
Tfw anything else is top tier neckbeard shit *teleports behind you*

"No hard feelings kid." retinas and kidneys at least Had to look that up myself. [Here you go.](http://legendsoflocalization.com/qa-is-this-character-in-pokemon-xy-transgender/) She was in either in the Battle Chateau or in the Battle Mansion. Not really. He's got a hot scientist wife. What? I definitely didn't see anything like that. Especially not after he introduced you to his wife. not to mention Meowth bangs your mom too... I'm talking about X/Y. M'ew Oh your m'best friend M'aiq is tired now, go bother someone else. But he's the best way to train Destruction and Conjuration! the fedora has been soiled to the point where it ruins any outfit  Jean shorts or get the fuck off my scooter. Until very recently, the only person I'd ever seen wearing a fedora was a man in his 80's who also wore a matching suit. I'd guess that his fedora was older than I was and he looked damned good in it. 

But then I made the mistake of going shopping in a nearby major city and saw young teens wearing them with MLP t-shirts and such. Yeah it's all about what you wear below it Lol people who down vote this have no fashion sense of their own. There are plenty of people who can pull it off casually. Some celebrities off the top of my head  are Jason Mraz and Bruno Mars You can use this [handy chart](https://i.imgur.com/nR9c1Gc.jpg) in future. I feel that the noun salad doesn't flow well in this version. It feels disjointed. Still an upvote for you though. It's an old pasta, sir, but it checks out.  All of this has been said 7+ years ago when making fun of fedoras was still a thing. I live in Asia where this is remarkably common. Fake glasses absolutely don't work for everyone.

If you are going to wear fake glasses, don't go overboard. Subtlety is key. You joke about BCGs but they just issued me some frames that are made by a designer company, I believe it's called Randolph.  Anyways, they're really fucking nice, I switched out my ray bans for them. You're thinking of Rick Perry, not Jeb Bush
 Ah. I'm new to the basement dweller scene. Glad to have advice from someone as experienced as yourself. ; ) i may be fat as a sea cow, but i do love my trench coat. keeps the winter winds from m'balls. Make it a duster and we got a deal. Since when were trench coats out? Even when I'm wearing my work/dress clothes and it's raining?  The fuck is wrong with newsboy hats? They're more comfortable than a baseball cap. There is this cook at the pub down the street that wears one. He seems alright.  Genius Not necessary. My face does the heavy lifting on that one.  It's like a chastity cage that you can wear on your head. Definitely has more to do with the rest of the ensemble than whether somebody is a sexual deviant. Just motherfuckers who don't know how to dress themselves. The fedora thing was a thing before the current MLP show even existed.  I'll have you know that just because I'm into my little pony, it doesn't stop my fedora from making me look [distinguished](http://i.imgur.com/xWgUrwt.jpg).  > not morbidly obese

You can definitely be fat and look good in a fedora. You just have to wear it properly... like [Al Capone](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NDAwMzk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA0MjMzMQ@@._V1_.jpg). Yeah, I wear it with a suit and tie.   Unless they're currently wearing a full Naruto costume. Who are you?!  Who am I?!  Am I you?! No, you're schizophrenic and this is also a multi million user platform with different people with different views on things. It's also impressive how both the Republican Party and the Democrat party are held in equally high regard in the American population!

Just because it's one population does not mean two totally different opinions can be held. Large populations are almost always highly varied. You can very rarely get an accurate generalisation.  A shirt you would typically wear with a suit  Buttons, collar, cuffs, and frequently worn with a tie. No graphics, text, or lettering. They have solid colors or pinstripes. They are the shirts you wear with a sport jacket, suit or tuxedo. Just witness the car crash scene last night. Still a little messed up from that Like how Araquanid traps small Pokémon in its water bubble helmet and drowns them Very true. A fedora works best with a matching coat of any kind (think heavy overcoats and sport jackets with wide lapels). One of the reasons that Sinatra looks so great in that picture is because the hat matches the jacket so well. I don't think it's the same material, but it's in the same realm of color, so it looks like it belongs. Aside from that, the short brim and the tall band frame his face really well, the angle of the picture is good, and he's wearing the best clothing of all: a confident smile :) I like Fedora's, but doubt I could pull off a Trilby. I put one on once and looked like a bad jazz musician. I've seen people wear hats with good suits (mostly in hipster NY)

Every single one looked like a douche
 2016 better be mythic rare. I don't want to see another year like this for a few decades.  That's because they stay inside unless buying a new katana from the local weeaboo store in the mall Why are you dragging r/the_donald mods into this? TOPICAL Man, fuck /u/Trumpshaker. Fuck u/spez 

EDIT: fuck everyone except u/spez  /u/spez is so cool. wew Heh Fuck /u/Cupcakes_n_Hacksaws Oh FFS do you know what shoehorning is? Because this is a textbook example  Label it a fedora, actually a trilby. Make sure you ask Al to play it If you don't mind me asking what's it about? How dpes modding even look.. Its so cool seeing them in games but im sure it looks not so cool while making them.. Are there any vids? There is also the greaser jacket and postman outfit.  Who'd want to enslave a kidney?  I hear bone marrow can fetch some change too.  I feel like that's lost in translation. It'd be a little ironic if she was transgender since she comes from X/Y lol [deleted] Of course, he's your dad. Yeah. I figured out from another comment. M'ew two you too. M'issingNo M'ee too thanks. M'agikarp M'ewoth M'arshtomp In a world we m'ust defend M'aiq is done talking. Unless you're 70+ years old and wearing a trenchcoat with a suit under it What all of them have in common though, is they don't look 15.

A good rule of thumb is, only wear it if you look mature and are dressed well.  What a finely aged meme 👌👌👌 And your momma jokes are literally several millenia old, but they still work.  Buddy of mine wears fake glasses all the time and they work on him, but I still give him shit for it constantly because he actually *is* blind as a bat and just too lazy to make an appointment with an optometrist.        >If you are going to wear fake glasses, don't go overboard

Alright, so only one pair at a time. Got it. Those glasses they're issuing to kids nowadays are NOT BCGs Also ensures nothing else will touch them either  Maybe you should start wearing pants, buddy. Neckbeards are ruining those as well. I know, I'm heartbroken too. So it's a 200 lb fedora?

I'm here all week folks. Exactly. Dressed business formal? A fedora can work. Wearing a tee and jeans? You're gonna look like a fucking idiot.  Being attractive also helps.  Al Capone was 5'11" and 255 lbs when he got to Alcatraz. Fat, but not morbidly obese by current standards. Nah, there's a difference between fat and morbidly obese. Al Capone was just big >step one: be adult in the 1930s

>step two: wear fedora

>step three: don't wear fedora outside of decades called the 30s

>step four: acquire currency Where did he come from, where did he go? /r/solipsism I'm a dude, he's a dude, she's a dude, cause we're all dudes!  I like Gumshoos': "It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner,  but as it's diurnal, it never encounters them." like what the fuck man this thing wants to eat my beloved Rattata? Jesus. He's also less than 250 pounds and attractive  I agree, and a "trilby" as I've learned now matches very will with the garbage can or incinerator. 1RUW

Legendary Creature - American

When God King Trump enters the battlefield exile all non-token permanents your opponents control with Spanish text on them. You may then search your library for a number of creature cards with Defender up to the number of permanents exiled this way and put them onto the battlefield tapped. If you do, shuffle your library.  Yeah, still not fitting the bill for most people I know that wear them. Most are either club owner playboys, business owners, etc. Where will the memes stop Isn't Spez the CEO of Reddit? This is the sort of low information voters I expect nowadays. I don't get it... I've heard they are really good at weaseling out of trouble. Because ~~fuck /u/spez~~ /u/spez is fine and nothing is wrong. You mean the soon to be X CEO of reddit, Fuck /u/AutoModerator Nice try Spez Bro do you even Reddit? Commenters reference topical subjects on the daily, it's been this way for years. I thought it was funny This is actually pretty clever tho. No way a reference on reddit that is hot? Wow im so shocked. They actually have separate trilbies from fedoras. Really covered their bases.  Yep, that drives me nuts.  People keep yammering about a Fedora when the hat in a certain particular picture is a Trilby.  A different hat style entirely.  The way how I feel about it is this.  If people must use a tired worn out to death meme at least be accurate about it.  It makes them look like idiots.
 Considering he's practically run out of Vegas quest mods I'd hope he would It's essentially your generic Pacino- like gangster movie, where your character destroys the competition for his organization and brings them to the top, but the plot isn't just more bounty hunting.

As the courier, you are looking to start a film production crew, but first must eliminate any competition, meaning other film studios. I have a few planned, but I'm working out multiple endings for each (diplomatic and violent solutions). After doing these for a while you realize there's more to the Vegas film industry than you initially thought, as you are suddenly attempting to take out one major crime family from Reno attempting to expand to Vegas. 

Two possible endings are planned, as well as an upgradeable film studio (player home), custom weapons from [Bay K,](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61810/?) and lots of Fallout 2 references :)

I'm fairly early into development, I've created and completed locations for nearly 3/4 of the entire mod (no nav meshes or the proper NPCs in location yet) and have written dialogue and created all of the NPC's (not voiced yet however). Right now my biggest struggle is the scripting as I'm still getting used to the GECK's scripting language. Once you get a hang of the basic controls it's actually pretty fun, although definitely requires a fair bit of patience. [Seddon4494](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE528CEE228C0DBB7) has an amazing set of tutorials for the GECK (Fallout 3/ New Vegas mod tools) that are worth checking out, and are great references when actually developing, and the official [Bethesda GECK tutorial](http://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php?title=Bethsoft_Tutorial_GECK_Setup) (the make your own vault one) is a good first- time tutorial that really goes in- depth with the very basics of the tools available. 

It all comes down to patience and being able to remember hotkeys and basic naming conventions (for example, the 'v' means 'vault' and 'r' means 'ruined' in 'VHallSm1WayR01")to get the most basic quest or new location mods going. Of course, scripting is a whole new challenge.  I played through half the game before I even realized you can wear things *under* your armor. I sat through so many cutscenes going "Does Bethesda really expect us to play through the game totally naked with skimpy combat armor?" and maxons coat
 diabetics worldwide probably bro not to mention the litres of blood donated and the further hope in life for all the amputees. see you arent worthless! Japanese source. I don't know if you understand but.. http://touch.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=39361775 M'ew two, thanks M'ssingNo* r/m'eirl That's right! Shut yo meowth. "M'aiq knows much, and tells some. M'aiq knows many things others do not." What if you're 2 children or 3 babies in a trench coat, then can you wear a fedora? what if it's a duster There's a bench at our local mall that always has on it atleast 2 elderly gentlemen in colored fedoras. One we see a lot is a very classy deep purple and grey stripe with a purple feather on it. Absolutely smashing! Fuck that. My grandfather wore one, every time I wear one I think of him. I've seen a straw fedora work well with casual attire. Let's be real. Being attractive us the most important part. But the well-groomed and well-dressed part does help there. He was certainly obese, though. And while I know they said morbidly obese, I was just talking about being fat in general. Where did you come from cotton eye Joe? Something something something cotton eye joe I feel like I'm the only one who ever goes to that sub I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude! You have to write on the back of the card to get to his activated ability. 


When God King Trump enters the battlefield, players and onlookers vote whether to allow God King Trump to enter the battlefield or exile God King Trump and replace with a 1/1 assassin token with deathtouch and haste. If God King Trump is exiled, return him to the battlefield. 

 Where do you think you are? There are no brak**e**s on this train. After 300 meters It's a joke where spez replaced references to his own name with references to the T_D mods He wont be for long.. Like the people who vote based on unchangeable social issues. [Context](https://archive.is/A6EGv) *Amen* Found the fedora enthusiast Thanks for the reply! looking forward to it now! Thanks buddy. Im gonna check this out and see what happens. Maybe ill stumble upon a new obsession Nah, he still is. But his corpse won't be! I call dibs on his ankles and iris holes!  Human blood is actually not that valuable. Printer ink is about two times as expensive by volume. You should screenshot this for karma. They will upvote anything  Only with a combined age of 70+. So,  no. And work in the job factory, doing a business? And really good at listening Do you have spurs on your boots?



^jingle^jangle You do you. They're just strangers on the internet. I've even seen a cloth one work, but it took very specific and planned out attire. 

Doesn't work with random TMNT tshirts, I'm afraid.  *drunk girl makes high pitched bird noise from bar* lol your comment is sly, love it That+mindslaver ... Seems like a one way ticket to infinite assassin tokens Judging by your username, I can see that you are an unfortunate fan of deathcore. [:(](https://youtu.be/e__1KU7lg-4?t=41s) My house. r/emboldenthee ? without any indications and silently, might I add Or believe there are people who will solve their problems, as if they have no control in their own lives which unchangeable social issues?

 INDIANA FUCKIN' JOOOOONES. That has to be a troll.  Sure, just keep an eye out on Nexus! I'm sure even the worst of quest mods could make it to the front page now that the Vegas modding scene is close to dead. well then die with a collection of printers I guess?
 Please, no. I'm sick of those kinds of posts. I'll take one for the team.  Its 2 babies and a 68 year old. Well you'd have to control them during your turn. but otherwise yeah, you could have arbitrarily large, but not infinite assassin tokens. If you never made them vote for Trump the game would be an unending stalemate.  Username checks out. DETH FUCKING CORE BABY OH YA BRING ON THE DEEEEEEEEEEEEETHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 Is that the song they originally used? I swear I remembered a different song for that scene... I admit nothing!^^^^^yes r/AVoid5!

 You shall not do such a thing as highlight that disgusting glyph! Yes. What he did, itself, isnt that bad, its more how he did it/that he did it. 

I hate r/donald, but that stuff pisses me off. If people actually acted like they had control over their lives, we wouldn't need to have half the laws we have.   Marriage, abortion, and separation of school and state mostly. Two are decided by courts. One by supreme Court which is practically impossible to overturn. The first amendment prevents the last.

They are non-issues. Robots took manufacturing jobs and china is cheaper than America.

 I think your comment makes it submission worthy Well it doesn't work then, either. I don't think you're supposed to keep your hat on in church. Oh, it absolutely is the original song. Netflix has changed a few OST songs because of licensing issues, but "Winter" by Joshua Radin is the original song used for the scene. [deleted] What do you mean? Any editing of user comments is fucking awful.

It doesn't matter that it was a small joke or even that it was agreeable, it was a fucking stupid thing to do.

I mean, it's a big fucking hit for the site's credibility if certain users can (and will) put words in your mouth to make it seem like you said something you didn't.

EDIT: Not only that, but it also damages the main assurance of free speech even further in that: if they will secretly abuse this power then why wouldn't they abuse the power of manipulating votes? Marriage is safe, it's other LGBT protections that are in danger. Abortion is legal but it's not hard for Trump and his minions to kill planned parenthood and make abortions hard to get You can overturn SC cases. Happened in Brown v. Board and a couple other times.  Whoops. Sorry. 1 Trillion Dollars.

I'm not sure if this figure is accurate but I want everyone to get angry as though it was. 32.00 for basic internet package

15.00 for 120 gbs extra (145 total)

10.00 for Bell Dryline

+ tax

= $65 - $70 

Essentially up to $20 more per month, for 100gbs less than our average usage. We can't afford the $55 insurance block, but if we could, our bill would be over $100.

 My ISP has implemented UBB about 1 year ago

$41.95 Internet standard package

$3.00 Modem rental

$30.00 Extra bandwidth

+taxes

Total: 85.45

I normally transfer between 200 and 300GB a month $150 $29.99.  I'm going to severely limit my usage.  They will not make an additional penny off of me. around $400 if i dont buy insurance, if i buy insurance around $90 not including taxes... Netflix is such a killer on the bandwidth when thats all you use for television. People say there is no selection on there but you would be surprised at the good movies when you just watch something based on the user ratings. Shut up, how the hell did you get so cheap? I'm paying just under 1 googol each month, and that's on a good month! That hand spinning like: Woop-dee-doo Imagine the guy in the house freaking out about the head popping out of the wall. Man, santa was a fucking dick back then huh?  So we can have heads stuck in solid bricks, and sass-hands.

^But ^not ^a ^grenade ^down ^a ^chimney

:( I like the hand doing the royal wave at the end. Really adds to it [Still doesn't beat the Black Ops Chimney grenade whoops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AByU5hG9N4) I wonder if you timed it right if you could assassins creed style assassinate someone in this game from the roof. Provided the enemy back is turned and you're able to fall right behind them, I wonder if the melee kill animation would stop you from dying from the fall.  [That little wave at the end...] (https://media.giphy.com/media/Vg0JstydL8HCg/giphy.gif) "Move along, nothing to see here" new tactics in the search for anne frank "There are no mistakes, only happy little accidents"  ~ Bob Ross Those ain't no nuke town chimneys I dont know what disappointed me more. The fact that you dies like that or the fact that you thought this game had that much detail to throw the grenade like that. Lmao that fucking wave at the end!  At first it was humorous. Then the hand appeared and I lost it. [Tatsumi Oga was passing by...](https://dreager1.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/beelzebub-356279.jpg) Can't believe no one said this but this looks like something out of Looney Tunes. The little hand wave and everything. It's perfect.  Oopsy Doodles  The wave killed me. Is it just me or do the throwing animations and physics for grenades in DICE games recently look cartoony as fuck?  That's using your head!

Ahahaha**hahaHAHAHAHAHA** "Oh there's a medic coming."

16-17-...

"okay then byyye, bitch. It's not like you could help me" "Helloooooo? Is anyone out there? I've seem to have lodged my cranium in the wall of this house.

Ooooo, I dare say, the decor in this room is smashing!" Him looking inside the house with his hand gesture

"Well look at Mr. Fancy with his new leather couches, ooh lala" He's tapping out!  Get him down from there!! They should use this on their adverts. 


"Only in Battlefield" Looks like you just picked a whole bouquet of oopsy-daisies I love the wave goodbye. don't you dare skip respawn!  Th-th-that's all folks! I like how he waves at the end LOL! Watchin that was like bangin my head against a brick wall  the waving hand finishes it. See, games don't need realism. It's funnier this way! I love the little wave he does towards the end. Do you want to leave people without X-Mas? Because this is how you leave people without X-Mas! What an unrealistically violent way to die. Zooooooppp, oops just another happy accident - Bob Ross "Ho ho ho, fuckers!" Cooooweee Jason! It's bill from next door  It looks like he was gonna do a little tap-dance, but then he couldn't cus he relised he was just gonna suffocate anyway :( I liked these games better when the launch bugs didn't get me killed and I could just laugh at long neck dudes. That spinning hand at the end "Hi anyone wanna help?!" *I don't know what I expected...* Did he prime that nade, or did it really go off that fast? So people can hide in fireplaces but we can't put grenades down there? 

Literally unplayable Cute wave at the end.  It's kind of eerie how he struggles and flops around before finally succumbing to the cold embrace of death. Mission failed, we'll get em next time  after seeing that you can go inside the chennmies  i was really hoping you could gas out a house like this, but me think the gas would kill me and i would choke and die  and then fall of the roof #justww1things? "Are you ok Hans?"

"So so..." That's the best death screen I have ever witnessed! Ragdoll physics glitches are the best thing to happen to games. Actual footage of Germans planning a Christmas attack come on Battlefield Call of Duty's been allowing you to throw grenades in chimneys since Call of Duty Black Ops on Nuketown Does this game have some destructible environments like other Battlefield games? That "goodbye cruel world" wave. DICE PLS Story of my life I can't help but picture this as Mr Bean. Note to self, grenades are no longer accepted as Christmas presents.  are you able to drop frags down the chimney?? That is impressive.... "Helloooo" *when his heads in the wall 'Look at the the flick of da wrist' Nothing to see here move along can't you see my hand..... move along Not sure accident insurance will cover that one. I think Medical Cheeba is gonna struggle to reach you up there I'm just disappointed they don't let you drop grenades down the chimney and into the fireplace underneath, preferably right next to a common sniping spot. Like, someone placed that chimney on the map and never thought to make this possible. THere are some really funny bugs. Last match I had one guy who looked like he was crucified, arms out to his sides and was just sliding around like that. He was shooting at me gun in one of the hands only, head was down. I was laughing too much to fire back.  Press F to pay respects for this "accident"  Necks Deployment  This is by far my favorite BF1 gif. I actually cried. Thanks for posting. POST-MORTEM JAZZ HAND So we finally got to see what happened to Anderson from the titanfall 2 campaign. The hand waving around is like- "HEY MAMA! LOOK WHAT I DID!!!" ...I'll just hang out here. Throw grenade, head stuck in wall. I guess that s the reason why the Germans had a pike on the top of their helmets. Wow season 2 of Stranger Things looks great! Wait, do they now consider some deaths "accidents"? Do they not count against your K/D? So do these people just film their entire gaming in the hopes of something happening?

Edit: oh ok cool. I had no idea you could do that on PS4. I play PC myself  These people invested in a no bomb chimney He learned the hard way that sometimes developers take short cuts on objects they dont think players will interact with often. Like having an actual chimney.  Didn't even read the title. Just saw the thumbnail and knew it would be bad.  Yeah had that happen before too...  Game isn't buggy at all guys. The 'well, that's all folks!' wave at the end took me from the standard Reddit loud nose exhale to guffawing in a toilet at work.  The 'well, that's all folks!' wave at the end took me from the standard Reddit loud nose exhale to guffawing in a toilet at work.  /r/GamePhysics  This was unsettling.  In CoD:UO the bunkers had a vent between the ground floor and basement you could throw grenades/satchel charges through.  Made clearing those bunkers *way* easier! hey, what you doing up there? ... oh ..er..just chillin' Santa Claus. Indeed. Mistakes into miracles I was an accident  So... you headbutted yourself into the wall, eh?  Hate it when that happens. So I'm guessing you cannot drop nades into the chimneys? Expect a lawsuit. Your hand grenade instructions weren't clear enough. Had head stuck in a wall the 3rd time this month. "A Warrior's Death". Fights over.. I saw the tap shut it down.  "You're...you're going to shove my head *where*?!" HO-HO mother fuck-OH SHIT! triggered Its as if they ported "Clop" into Call of Duty. lol /r/Unexpected/ material! Ass hangin all out beggin for a bayonet charge Yulia and john are sitting in their closet scared of the war outside. John hears a loud boom looks up at the dust falling from his ceiling only to see cedrick, a frontline men for the German army, his eyes rolled in the back of his head. John out of anger for the German army proceeds to put things such as pencils and finger food in cedricks nose and mouth. Yulia and john have a good laugh God, what a regret that game was... Jesus that's terrifying. I call those players "Clausers" because they be Santa Clausing down the chimneys.  The hand made me think not of "it's a living!" with the laugh track in the back.  War is Hell. No one expects the house to be a mimic    \#justwwIthings Glitched bodies in BF1 are too funny. I hope they never fix them.  I'm still waiting for realistic chimney sweap physics.  "Next gen" Dawww he's waving goodbye  Santa Clause is coming to town... oh crap my presents didn't go down all the way... raawwhh So if a nade can't fit down that chimney how does Santa give those kids their presents!?!?!? Too-da-loo mother fuckers. that hand wave  LMAO [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/AdgJ6qg.png)

I hope you like it lol that i didnt expect He's waving good bye after accidently falling Goddamn! Look at that sass hand! So are you supposed to safely jump off a 25-foot chimney? Annnnd the medic doesn't come to help Talk about a good idea coming back to bite you. Dropping a grenade into the center of the house would of been awesome  that hand wave at the end LOL I think he's trying to wave a medic down. Not like they'll come anyways war is hell.... I'd say.  r/gamephysics Game of the year The hand at the end: "This isn't the first time this shit happened to me" So I'm not the only one that's terrible at this game! Reminds me of the Wile E. Coyote shenanigans, like the finger tapping after a failed experiment or trap. Mimics can be ANYWHERE This game is so damn good A for effort, man. Cant throw the grenade down the chimney? LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE! Dat hand though I like how when you die by an explosion every physic force but the explosion disappear Me too thanks This is the funniest thing I've ever seen
 Minus 5 to Realism Score Bf1 Bloopers :D That moment he knew he fucked up "Hello! I'm a man with his head in wall." What is this hahaha pufta hey? Get Your Head Out The Gutter. PSA- For those interested, here is some incredible BF1 "lore": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFMT_BVBBsA

It's very long, but worth it. Recommended listening in the car or commute. This is not Dying Light, dude XD So Santa was a terrorist back then? Does anyone now that if you prone you don't get killed by the gernade This is now my favorite gaming GIF.  literally unplayable. **♫ LOOK AT DA FLICK OF DAT WRIST!! ♫** Typical medic, running away. Ho ho ho! Merry chri-

...

Fuck Lol He's waving to the people in inside the house. Ha....creep. lol The sassy hand waving at the end like "ui,ui,ui,ui" I like the wave at the end.  very "super genius" [Surprised that no one linked this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b5/42/24/b542240297b6ed46135a6f02f902cc53.jpg) Do people record all of their games just in case something like this happens..? Who knew that death, from a grenade, made you sassy as fuck. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Aaaaand:

#Jazzhands "Keep it moving, nothing to see here" I thought he was tapping out It's like he's waving everyone on. "Nothing to see here boys" I lost it there. For some reason my immediate thought was it was a British soldier, and he tried to put off the embarrassment of his predicament by performing a ridiculous stereotype impression of a French soldier. It is waiving good bye, game over sucker.  That hand fucking killed me.  reminds me of the queens waving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5pkDB7zEeo Don't think it's the hand. I believe it's a scarf. Reminded me of Raj on BBT when he is taking the trial medication for social awkwardness, and he is experiencing side affects.  One being his hand keeps moving after gestures. He got blown up so hard he turned into Wile E Coyote Haha more like, "Move along, nothing to see here." Did anyone else wave back? More like, go on.. Ain't nothing to see here! "I'm OK!" "You got me." 

Golf claps with only remaining hand. LOOK AT THE FLICK OF THE WRIST Reminds me of meatspin without the "You are now gay :)" He's saying "go around"  I've had one of those whoop-dee-doos after an accidental suicide, too! Ohh yeah yeah just get on with it "Annnd that's all folks!" The royal wave Seems like he is tapping out :P Some troll developer I'm sure... I thought of it more as the handkerchief shake like, "Yooo-hoooo".  >Howdy neighbour! "Hey, Ron!"

I think this was krampus doing You would be too, if somebody tried to drop a grenade on *your* head. That's what he gets for not going next door. Rigged the chimney for Dave This was Santa Klaus not Santa Claus. That was Belsnickel. OP was trying to help Robot Santa. Not since the accident. [He was a bad ass mofo](https://i.redd.it/v41vwyyq5nux.jpg) One day technology may allow realistic chimney physics.  Someone just needs to make a chimney sweeper simulation.

Chim chimeny chim chimeny chim chim charoooo... I feel like he's saying, "I'm okay everyone! Don't worry about meee!" It's the [Rimmer salute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al5bErqFrDQ)!

 holy shit, they actually made it a functional chimney? Typical COD move.. Spawn, aim up, instantly throw grenade. I don't even think they should be mad, that's amazing.  Why didn't it kill the guy in front of him, who was closer to the chimney, but killed him? Ha! (unlucky) (fail) wow the original nuketown kinda looks like crap I don't know about BF1, but that was possible in BF4.  I havnt done it from a crazy height, but at least in the beta I know I was able to hop off things and almost instantly start the knife animation.  720 no fall blade montage  *If they came to hear me beg....* You can, not sure if the melee kill animation will stop dying though.  Saw it happen the other day. Guy jumped off a building, landed on my friend and knifed him.  I got someone off the cliff in Sinai desert like this Well someone did jump off a roof and kill me with a SHOTGUN in midair so....close enough. If they came to hear me beg... [Calculated.](http://a.abcnews.com/images/GMA/gma_spec_queen_120605_wg.jpg) Cage's such a brilliant horrible actor... I didn't know Nick Cages posed for Sensible Chuckle.  Funny, but wrong war.  What a disqusting and evil comment, that tragic event is not something to make fun of. I feel like dropping a grenade down a chimney is kind of overkill  She wasn't even a sperm cell back then. Well you can [climb in the fireplace](https://gfycat.com/GrouchySandyCamel).  It honestly wouldn't surprise me if they patched it so that grenades could be thrown down. call of duty did it years ago on nuketown... Years ago, you couldn't even shoot through the spaces in picket fences. Game engines are constantly getting more advanced so, it's not entirely unreasonable to think you could throw grenades down a chimney. I think that's the only Manga I've ever read.  Babu ~

Thats thinkin wit yer dipstick 5m - 4m - 3m - 2m - 1m- skips revive y They took Christmas away from the soldiers in WWI after the first one went so well. oh yeah On Nuketown, and Nuketown 2025 it was possible to throw grenades and combat axes in thr blue chimeny I believe that a number of the apps that do this have a hotkey for "save the last X minutes" for when something cool happens. yeah you can set it up so that your recordings are deleted automatically if you don't go and save the clips within, say, an hour or something On PS4 it's constantly recording your gameplay and you can save the previous 15 minutes of footage. So yeah, if something crazy happens on PS4 you can always save it and watch again. That's on xbox, there's a feature that records the last 30 seconds of gameplay when you want it to Guess I'm dead... toodle-ooo! Poof Bomb "MM DID I DO THAAAT?" Sassy bitch in tha house!

Krampus was on the German's side during ww1 that's why he's no longer around. He only punishes children because he truly loves them! What's a Krampus? Sounds like "feminine hygiene relief" product.

PS I Googled it straight after making this joke so please no need for filling me in... *desperately trying not to make another inappropriate joke right now* *sigh*, how many Beefalo did you kill? 10/10 Would buy I'm sure that I used to have a game on PS1 with chimneys you could chuck grenades down. Really struggling to remember what it was called though.
 Im all right! Nobody worry 'bout me! Better chimneys in CoD than in BF. Cod likes to add a lot of little details like this.

Im surprised there's so much hate for it. Not since the accident. It's not weird considering that's Nuketown, one of the smallest maps. I don't know from your comment if you think it's a bad thing or if you're just stating a fact. Because that was his teammate and friendly fire was off He was a highlander. It didn't age well  But would it mitigate fall damage?  It gets more Lunatic Chuckle toward the end of the gif. War... war never changes. They were just having a headstart Why do you think there was a second world war and hasn't been a third?

Edit: you're all wrong. We found the girl. Game over [deleted] good point, adolph. not the grenade, sticking his head through the roof. Nice little spot you found there.. where is the fire? Or jumped down if you are overweight with a full white beard and are wearing a red suit with a white fur trim... I saw a guy in that very fireplace this weekend.  I chucked a tank grenade at him, took out four people.  Good times. To be fair nuketown had only two houses you could actually go next to/inside. 

 Which is weird because you couldn't even get on the roof Ugh, games are regressing It's not much fun. Nice ^^ Nice. It's always so cool to find stuff like this in games.

Guess that finally solidify's that CoD is better than BF. /s now thats a fact! no hate for the details, but there is a lot of hate for a game that keeps getting worse, while others are getting better I played MW3 recently. And they had captured India better than any other game. It wasn't just generic India, they captured that specific mountain state really well. 

They probably sent someone to tour the place and took a lot of photos. I was like "whoa, this does feel like a small town in Himachal Pradesh.  Well there is the whole Pay to Win structure in the new one. I feel for them though, they've been working on IW since when people liked BOII and it's future setting. It's not like they could've started over half way through development when BOIII was even starting to make people grow tired of the sci-fi theme. Personally, I think they need to make a shift to more humanized wars like BF1 has done. Its stupid is his point. Its one of the reasons people don't like COD. Ah, got it. Thanks! Hah, thanks, I was thinking up complex physics modeling reasons why, but the simple explanation usually does the job better. That's what the French Generals thought in WWI when the they sent their troops into battle in bright blue uniforms against Germans with machine guns. But... but sometimes it does. WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR? The UN. Nukes Ummm, because the US Presidential Election hasn't finished yet, duh.  Because of what ended the second in the pacific theatre.
 Grandpa? He almost had me there... The fire was suppressed with a gas grenade.  Actually I got that clip [from this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/5a8ldk/til_that_you_can_get_inside_chimneys/).  Available in the [Christmas Truce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce) DLC. Oh I'm not saying cod is better. Just saying don't call a guy out for trying it when other games have done it in the past :) Aren't most houses the same materials/textures? So if one had a real chimney wouldn't all of them technically have one?  This battlefield map would probably have two houses if it was designed for a 6v6 arcade shooter.  Yeah but you could kobe one in. I have a clip somewhere of a guy throwing one in and killing all six of our team off of the headquarters point in that building.  I abused it when i found out Is that Boris Johnson, perchance?  What's this from!? I've seen it before, but not for a while, and I'd love to see it again.

Never realized how great Flanders is sporting that WWI-stache How is that creepy?  oft-overlooked?! No way she's always been a babe [deleted] Turned out they liked to be spanked. So *that's* what Ludendorff was talking about when he complained of being "stabbed in the back". Possibly, I don't remember ever playing that game though.

Edit: It may even have been a James Bond game. I don't even think I saw one fish in BF1. I'm selling it. > ~~Better fish~~ AI too.

Fixed it. Whoa.. you can't really compare the 2. They both do what they do pretty well.. they don't try to be like each other. > but there is a lot of hate for a game that keeps getting worse

Thats the hate im talking about. It has very objectively not getting worse with most releases but people like to pretend the only good game they ever made was cod 4. If the general opinion was that th newer ones just werent as hot then fine, but the hatred it recieves is ridiculous. (though I do hate microtransactions in the new one) All I know is that I was basically a power ranger in black ops 3 COD has smaller maps than BF. Doesn't make it objectively better. That's like saying Skyrim is objectively better than Assassin's Creed 2 because it has a larger world. You can't compare them. Right, im that case I think it's a useless comment. I hold no particular love for Call of Duty, but the endless hate it gets for not being like other shooters is ridiculous.

They are fun games in their own regards. Nearly every iteration of COD has a perk that reduces explosive damage. If hail mary nades ever became that much of a problem, there's an easy solution. You forgot to mention they walked over open fields in Marching order... The Germans did the same against the British at the Marne. Marched straight into the machine guns, wave after wave. > That's what the French Generals thought in WWI when the they sent their troops into battle in bright blue uniforms against Germans with machine guns.

Yeah that was pretty bad: http://i.imgur.com/HtfcvGa.jpg

It was worse than you know, because they even used cavalry with breastplates: http://i.imgur.com/NtnDkd2.jpg

But it's not like the Germans weren't also doing something similar: http://i.imgur.com/dOwXi8E.jpg Good post, professor. Well it makes for some great video games! No matter who wins, we lose.  Especially since you can do this; https://fat.gfycat.com/GrouchySandyCamel.webm No worries I definitely knew what you were saying.  Depends on whether they reused it or not. If they actually wanted a bunch of identical houses then sure. Still, it's always going to be simpler to not have chimneys be hollow, since doing that means to some extent you have to model the inside. Even if you just give it a solid black texture with no detail, you can still almost double the geometry of it. Oh shit I would too, if I had the game.

So, it looks creepy because that's what the intention was when animating it. Where have you been? Compliments are creepy now.

Damn kinky Germans  Me too Literally unfishable He was being sarcastic lol Honestly I feel like the series has really only started going downhill since Ghosts. I really enjoyed the Black Ops series (3 not so much however) and found them to have the best multiplayer and side stuff (zombies) compared to the Modern Warfare series. MW3 was actually pretty decent as well.  The fact you can throw a grenade across the map is definitely a knock. I'm not arguing they aren't fun. Just saying comparitively.  Also artillery. Yes that's unfortunate. Didn't know that. I wasn't out to bash the French. Turns out the old guard sticks around too long no matter the country.  And before that they did it to the Belgians when they moved through Belgium. Belgians had huge forts with sunken turrets and the Germans marched straight at them.  lol that's pretty sweet.  Well now I am incredibly disappointed about the chimney.

(or possibly Tetsuo now I think about it, it's been a while...) ಠ_ಠಠ_____ Glenn?! The Old Gods are leaking... Is calling a stranger hot an appropriate compliment? That's totally weird.  Saying "She's hot" on Reddit after seeing a 5 second clip of her topless isn't a compliment. I don't consider anything a compliment unless you say it to her face, and women definitely don't either.  I hope his pantleg gets caught and a bloodbath ensues ...thanks Jesus. I even saw the /s. Whatever. Leaving it I love the seriousness. I think a lot of cod players agree with you. Black ops 2 was my favorite game, but I lost interest with cod after I got my hands on Ghosts. Advanced warfare was my last cod game, and I doubt they'll win me back with the way the series is going. I only play the peak of the CoD franchise - CoD: Finest Hour.

Because I have a PS2 as my console. Generally, at the beginning of WWI it was a shitty time to be part of the French Army There's a famous saying "Generals always fight the last war" which speaks to this very point. French Vieille Garde were pretty badass but that was a very different war... Most units did this in World War I.  As the marching style was the only known way to fight until the advanced weapons of the war came into play.  The first Marines did this as well.  However they quickly learned that those tactics didn't work anymore.  They quickly developed trench/new tactics on the fly to save numbers.    Still even after success of these new tactics, stubborn officers would force their men to marching orders.  Wave after wave would die. :( > ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ

You can say that about any war where they fought Germany. Or the Austro army This is pretty much true for both sides.  But, yeah, the French were woefully unprepared for what technological advancement had done to warfare. [Don't stop me now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAxpAs1Iaec)

The game is Dark Souls 3. I'm 90% sure of this too. Would love to see how this ended lol Why does the far left phantoms cloak move in time with the rotation of the camera to bring him into view?  

Is the physics of the models tied to the games camera client side or something? I smile every time i see DS on this sub.  Who do you know?  "Time to close your eyes." "Pissin' our pants, yet?"

So you're probably wondering how I got there. Characters that are shiny red are people that have invaded into another player's world and their goal is to kill the player. The ones that are gold and silver have been summoned by the player of the world and are allies to the player. I don't know the difference between the gold and silver allies though. He is red because he is an invader (you join the world of someone who has used a certain item to kill them)

They are silver/gold because they are phantoms, the same as you except specifically accepted to join the hosts world, and they work with him to get through the levels. One is gold because of a group he's joined, that rewards him for phantom work. The game is dark souls, in the game you can invade other players in an otherwise mostly single player game, we call other players phantoms. The other people you see are also phantoms except the white one, who is the original player. He looks white to other players to indicate he is the main player, which it is the red phantoms goal to kill. The other 2 phantoms next to him are friends he summoned to help in the game, fighting monsters, or in this case the invader (red phantom). Hope that helped!
 it's how the PvP aspect of the Dark Souls franchise works.

Players who are connected and meet certain in game requirements (in Dark Souls 3 it's using an item called Embers, which can be farmed or you automatically entered "embered" state when you beat a boss) can connect with players online for PvP or Co-Op play.

Being a red spirit is considered being an "invader" by game. You can become a red spirit by either using an item that will port you into another capable player's world, or using a separate item to place a summon sign that a connected player can use to summon you (for dueling or setting up a fight club). Killing a player as a red phantom gets you items that you can use to level your Covenant, and ultimately unlock weapons and armor in game.

A white spirit is a phantom. Similar to how red phantoms can place summon signs, players can also place white summon signs which act as a means for co-op play. The white spirit can't attack the summoned player, but *can* help them in combat or during boss fights. As a white phantom, defeating a boss or invading spirits can grant you items to level up your covenant of choice (minus two of them which are designed around invading and killing other players)

Same rule applies for the Yellow phantom, the only difference being that the yellow phantom is a member of the Warriors of Sunlight covenant, which changes their summon sign and phantom color from white to yellow. 

There's also blue phantoms (which are players who are "auto summoned" when a person of the same covenant gets invaded in an area you're currently playing through), blue phantoms with red hues (which are another auto-summon convenant tied to specific areas of the game, only the players who are summoned have to kill  the person they're summoned for), and Purple phantoms, which are "wild cards"  Different covenants have different colours



Invaders = red


People who aren't part of a PVE covenant and are just gaming = summoned white


People who pledge to the almighty sun bros for jolly cooperation = gold In the soulsborne series, there are several factions (covenants) for invading and summoning. Invaders are either red or blue, usually. Red invaders (phantoms) are hostiles who seek to kill the world's host. Blue phantoms are either hunting down those who do a lot of red invasions, or are summoned for help fend off invaders if you are in a certain covenant. People can leave summon signs on the ground in order to help players through an area. These phantoms are by default white, but can be gold if they are part if a certain covenant.    
( \ [T] / )     
Just to screw all this over, there are also rings that change your phantom colour.

 Hilarious stuff like this can only be dark souls, and I don't even play it.

I certainly feel like it's the most difficult of the Soulsborne games. I've played three different characters, but haven't finished the game. I have a strength character, a "quality" character, and a skill character. All three tend to feel very underpowered the later I go in the game. I never felt like this in any of the other Souls games. Nah, not enough R1 spam. And nobody's even pointing down! What part of the game do you want explained? The normal gameplay is "punishing" in that simple things can get you killed, but you learn what they are, where the enemies are and what things do as you play. Therefore, if something kills you once, you'll most likely remember it and you "get better" by not letting it occur again. Some aspects are just outright hard though...overall it's a great challenge. 

For PvP however, its basically you invade to try to kill other players who either aren't expecting it or have welcomed in competition (both to show who's better at playing the game). Then you have people who can be summoned in to help by the player who was invaded (either on purpose or automatically, depends on other players pvp decisions). It boils down to just going in to kill a player, or try to, and sometimes its a 1v1 and sometimes its 1v2 or 1v3. It's a gamble you make when you try to punish other players, sometimes you yourself are punished.

Tl;Dr Great game. Difficulty comes from learning attack patterns and enemy locations. PvP is awesome in that crazy fights can occur. This is the PVP/completely optional mode of the game. The main game is a single player, 3rd person melee game in which you have long stretches of areas with enemies and a boss somewhere hidden in them. The main idea is getting through very challenges areas, parts of the map, levels (literally whatever you want to call them) in order to unlock new checkpoints and discover/defeat very challenging bosses. It's a giant open world, but checkpoints unlock new fast travel hubs, essentially, and without finding them you won't get to fast travel. It's not for everyone but is extremely rewarding in how difficult it is/feelings of accomplishment/ sense of discovery. Personally, I prefer Bloodborne which is the PS4 exclusive from the same franchise and developers, but they're rather similar from an outside POV, if not extremely. I am not into what is in this gif which is PVP (player vs player) fights and invading. 

The main point is basically upgrading your weapons, skills, and armour as you discover new enemies and bosses and locations and it's "thing" is that it's highly punishing (not difficult always just punishing). It's not for everyone, but as a casual gamer I was able to beat several Souls games. It's a very fun challenge and unlike anything else. Though, certainly not for everyone.  Red guy is an invader, the 3 behind him are playing through the campaign together and he invaded their world with the intent of killing them They're actual players. Dark Souls has a very odd community. Sometimes people will just massacre you the moment they see you, and other times they'll try to make friends with the invader and recruit him to their cause. You never know what to expect when invading somebody else's world. It was set up as a gag, the vid maker says so elsewhere on this page Players Red/Purple/Red-tinged Blue is an invading phantom, there to kill the host of the world in PvP. White is a phantom summoned by the host to help. Gold is a phantom summoned by the host to help, who is also in a covenant known as the "Warriors of Sunlight" who get specific rewards for helping hosts. Blue phantoms can be auto summoned by the host to help kill an invader if the host is in the "Way of Blue" covenant. The host is normal colours. It's to denote they are invading a world.  Only other player-controlled characters have this color, no npcs/monsters/enemies,etc. [YOU DIED](https://imgur.com/lXaJSBX) Always happens like that in DS3, for some reason. Player objects with physics attached will always be flung by the camera when initially entering view. Looks like he just got into position at the last split second. Its that ' Oh Sh!t ' moment that makes me question every aspect of my build. Not gonna happen if he's using Brigand Twindaggers vs 3 dudes using Dragonslayer Greataxe, Profaned GS and a Butcher's Knife dark souls 3 3 on 1 group up with greatswords? He is in trouble, unless he switches to magic quickly, he is dead. So in dark souls you can summon phantoms (other players or Npcs) to your world to help you fight. The phantoms glow based on their faction (called covenants). By default, summoned helpers are white, if a warrior of sunlight is summoned they glow gold. If help is summoned you open yourself up to being invaded. Invading phantoms glow red by default. Invaders try to kill the host player, and the white and gold phantoms try to protect him. As a red, running into one white or gold is often bad enough. Three is... Well you're fucked basically.  their chief weapon is surprise after all No, no, no, it's nobody inspects the Spanish exposition!  I don't think anyone else expected the Spanish Memequisition either I are he. He are we.  I always feel like.....*somebody's watchin' me!!*

"Kids! You noticing all this plight?"  Roll up the hootie mac. Roll em up Roll em up The "hi" is a nice touch. I wish there was a way not to get invaded.  Could you describe that feeling more for me?

 I would imagine gold summons are sun bros and silver are generic plebs.  Gold and white phantoms are just way to distinguish covenants. The gold guy is apart of the sun covenant and their whole gag is they worship the sun, you've probably seen memes of it with people saying "praise the sun" while raising their hands above their head in a certain pose. The white dudes are just apart of any other covenant and if they use a white soapstone. There are more colors for phantoms, you can be blue(apart of the blue sentinels or darkmoon blade) and that means the host of the world was invaded by red/purple/red-blue/orange phantom and you're there to kill the bad phantoms. Purple phantoms are mad phantoms and they can get their reward from killing enough phantoms or just the host, orange phantoms are sunlight phantoms that are invading the host and not helping them(so they're not golden), red-blue phantoms invade if you go into either the Aldrich faithfuls territory or you go into the Watchdogs territory. Okay, so the red guy is invading, the gold and silver guys are summoned by the player. So which one is the player? Also, are the gold and silver dudes human controlled or are they AI? >Characters that are shiny red are people that have invaded into another player's world and their goal is to kill the player. The ones that are gold and silver have been summoned by the player of the world and are allies to the player. I don't know the difference between the gold and silver allies though.

The colour is based on the covenant you are a part of.

White is nocovenant, gold is warriors of sunlight, red is rosarias fingers, purple is mound makers, aldritch faithful and farron watchdogs are like a blue-red, blue sentinels and blade of the darkboon are blue. Sun bros. 

Praise the sun.  The ones in gold belong to a certain in game faction called the warriors of sunlight that exists as a co-op group There are various organizations (covenants) in the game that you can join that affect PvP play. Depending on which you're in, you can be one of a few colors.

Covenant of the Sun (sunbros) reward JOLLY COOPERATION. Helpful sunbros are gold, and invading sunbros are red with a gold tint. When an area boss is defeated with a helpful sunbro, everyone gets a reward for the covenant. Same for if invaders kill the host with an invading sunbro.

Moundmakers (mad phantoms) are purple whether they're summoned to help, duel, or invade. They want to either kill the host or some number of phantoms, and they can hit anyone and everyone. They're fun because you never know if they'll betray you. 

There are a couple of area-guarding covenants which automatically invade you in those areas to kill you, and they're red with a blue tint. There are also covenants that are automatically summoned to aid you, which are blue spirits.

White spirits are members of any covenant other than sunbros or moundmakers that are summoned to help. Red spirits are members of any covenant other than sunbros or moundmakers that actively invade or are summoned to fight.

For extra fun, there's an item that makes you appear as a white spirit no matter what you are, as well as an item that makes you appear as a host. the gold ones are members of sunlight covenant aka sunbros. the silver ones are from the other covenants - mound makers and 1 or 2. Gold are sun bros. White are just normal bros ok ty, i get the context of it now
 Actually, the white one is a phantom as well. That initial movement at the bottom of the stairs was the "host" of these phantoms.

The color of phantoms is decided by their covenant alignment. Covenants being organizations in the game that you can level up by completing specific tasks unique to the different covenants.

Red - Rosaria's Fingers - Player vs Player / Invasion of Other Players

Yellow - Warriors of Sunlight - Cooperative / Assisting of Other Players 

White - No Covenant Alignment - Either no covenant badge is equipped, or else covenant objective is unobtainable under the circumstances of summon

Purple - Mound Makers - Player vs Player / Player vs Environment / General "Wild Card" Player

Blue - Blue Sentinel / Darkmoon Blade - Player vs Player / Player vs Environment / Co-operative / Assist Against Invaders of Host

Indigo - Aldritch Faithful / Watchers of Farron - Player vs Player / Summoned as Invaders to Protect a Specific Zone of the World from Host absolutely thanks a lot
 Roundabout - Yes Now I know you may be asking "Wait, middle schools exist in the Dark Souls universe?". To that I must answer: SHUT UP! Let me tell the story... It probably seemed better to me because I just came across it as a surprise, there was no build up :( sorry The encounter was probably real. But he ruined it by dubbing over it later instead of being genuine. That's cause it is. It was me as the host running down the stairs. Patokia, Vestort and Dig Boss are the ones that are behind Jelly there.

It's pretty obvious, but it's a gag. (Heck I was wearing fallen knight outfit with **2 dark swords**) Probably only the dub, these encounters can be real. When I play with friends and get invaded, we regularly set traps like this. Buddies hide behind wall, host leads the invader in front of buddies, buddies shank the fuck out of invader. The gif is better sadly. Here you go: https://youtu.be/sfjzkQpvNp4 at 2:09 I think  They could auto-mod that too. If you don't have [gamename] at the beginning or end of the post it should just delete. I've been here the whole time and never seen one belt with this view coloration going on. Office Space. Pretty good chuckle.  And you should watch that movie asap It's a movie called Office Space I never used the rolling attack.  Run in, R1 combo, weapon art.  Usually by then, you're done. That's getting patched on the 11th, actually. So rejoice! Don't forget GFS and washing pole running r1 It is, it's just not enforced. Yet here you are scrolled all this way :l Oh, thank you. [Me reading your post](http://i.imgur.com/5oaqQPT.gif) Ahhh....  I guess I'll need to play the game. Their chief weapon was actually being able to launch 90kg projectiles over 300m.

Good lad, m.A.A.d duchy mofck "I'm off to fill Manus' man-cavern with my Estus Flask." "Take my weird-ass shield puppy Sif, it will protect you from urban violence" Uuuuh how about don't go embered or unplug your internet connection?  You can play offline and it takes out the invasion part by other players. You still have access to the NPCs that invade. I play offline since it's my first play through and I already die enough haha not playing the game I've only played part of 1, so I guess my ignorance was to be expected, but I had no idea you'd eventually be able to go kaioken. If only I could be so grossly incandescent. Tough enemy ahead. Therefore, praise the Sun!  Pretty much.

The gold are sunbro's and the silver/white are genetic friendly phantoms. 

EDIT: Not fixing typo. Praise genetically predisposed good guys. The gold ones are the glorious sunbro master race where as the dude in silver is a friendly spooky ghost that will probably fall over from a gentle breeze since he didn't join a covenant and therefore is bad Praise the Sun! \\[]/ Sounds like purple phantom is the way to be. 

Some men just want to watch the world burn. The player doesn't have a color, only summoned or invading players do (the person recording is invading). You can see him run by the bottom of the stairs for a second in the gif.

The gold/silver guys in this case are other players, but there are AIs you can summon that look similar. The gold and silver dudes are other players, but it is possible to summon AIs as well. The game allows for multiplayer in this sense of being able to summon other players to your world to help out. The main player (the player who's world everyone else is in) looks normal. From the gif, the player is the guy you see at the bottom of the stairs running away before the red guy turns around to see the gold and silver guys. The host player will not be brightly lit up unless they are wearing a specific ring (it's rare to see it used though), and yes all 3 of those phantoms would be players- AI phantoms (they do exist) are extremely aggressive to the point of stupidity. All general invaders are red though. A sunbro can invade and still be red though a more golden red. >blue-red

Sooo... purple? [deleted] Actually, the white one is a phantom as well. That initial movement at the bottom of the stairs was the "host" of these phantoms, since hosts are the only "uncolored" during Online interactions! Thank you! I'm going to go learn (read:fail) this on the bass School is convoluted in Lordran. Absolutely no reason to be sorry. You still provided the source.   This guy could have been good if he got his comedic timing right.

His "wait hold on" before spinning around ruined it because he should not have known anything at that point.

Spinning the camera - seeing them (even slowing the video to prolong the moment facing them in silence) then cutting the music with the "fuck fuck fuck" wouldn't have ruined the comedy of it. Also known as dunky-ing it. I so desperately want to try this. Best I had so far was running human in the depths trying to rest a bonfire that was seemingly bugged, when I was suddenly invaded. Legged it out the front door, saw a sunbro sign on the floor, immediately brought him in and watched the two duke it out :D A rare case on reddit 2:17 kind of like r/sex I know what each of these words means individually, but I don't understand them in this configuration. The woes of being a default sub - lack of mods. Actually it's not. The only rule regarding how the title should be formatted is rule 5

It needs to be a rule, but like someone else pointed out, it wouldn't be enforced anyway due to lack of active mods.  Yeah Dark Souls is confusing as fuck Wouldn't, unless you like getting frustrated a lot.

But seriously, if you wanna play with friends you'll be invaded for sure. Though it's much easier to fuck the invaders up when you're also voice chatting with your friends. Beating one of those mini bosses gets you auto embered.  First time I played the game, I had no idea what is the online element of the game is. I got invaded by a red spirit, and I thought the name and the AI felt very human like. I got killed like the noob I was, was very pissed because I got invaded as I was trying to escape the swamp area in Dark Souls 1.

I grew to appreciate the online aspect of a DS game as I played it more. In 3, you're never going to be invaded if you're not doing co-op anyway. Which, if you're offline, you're not doing regardless. So really there is little reason to do offline, unless you really want the additional predictability for speedrunning and the like. Of course, feel free to enjoy the games however you want, just saying. You can also play in offline mode but that means you dont get messages or helpful spirits too The only way to really win.  ***OH, BUT YOU CAN GET CLOSE! HAVE FAITH, FELLOW SUN BRO!*** Not as friendly as those nice purple folk.  genetic phantoms? The goldbros don't want none unless you got sun hun Mfw I'm a finger and get tongue. 

Mfw I'm a mound maker and people summon me expecting I don't backstab them right before the boss fog wall.

Mfw I'm grossly incandescent and I've gotten 99 embers before Irithyll from getting summoned.  Or, you know, he's in any covenant bar the Sunbros or the Grapists T_T Ahem \\[T]/ Not really. Purple prioritizes you invading worlds with lots of phantoms in it. So that can mean you're invading a world where it will be you vs 3 other players, and lots of time other invading phantoms will kill purple phantoms cause they don't trust them. The whole point of purple phantoms was that it was supposed to be a wildcard and that you could actually summon a purple phantom and they could help you through the level but they could also kill you. The problem is that purple phantoms only get rewards for killing the host or other phantoms(if the world has 3 phantoms, it's 2 that he needs to kill, it's always one less or just one phantom if only one phantom is there), so there is no real reason to let a purple live. PvP is pretty bad in DS3 in my opinion, lots of oversights.  Are there invading AIs? And can you opt out when starting a game? I'm wondering why you couldn't grief someone by playing a super powerful character and invading a player who is just starting out. [Nope, blue-red is a pretty accurate description](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ur6rUiVFiVA/maxresdefault.jpg)  No. It's blue with red highlights. Unless one of the phantoms/invaders is wearing the ring that removes your color, or the ring that makes you appear as a phantom. Dark Souls is a confusing game sometimes. you're right, sorry Dunky is actually good at it, though. Has anyone ever gone so far as even to need more to do look more like? https://youtu.be/xq0XNILIYTw Isn't /r/askscience default? You can setup auto moderator to do this, don't need mods.

Edit: Words I am the walrus SNOOPINGAS USUAL I SEE? I've got the master plan! Can you blame them? They've got the best deals anywhere. That's kind of the entire point though. Playing with friends reduces the game difficulty so they bring a new challenge with invasions. Invasions are essentially a trade-off for coop.  Unless you've got Kim Jong Un playing with his modem that uses a telegraph to communicate with the outside world's internet, and you get backstabbed through your face from across the map :(. This made me so happy Lol that video is great. They even  had the crow dancing. And I like how the asylum demon looked upset because he wasn't part of the fun, like a kid looking longingly out a window The invasion calculation HEAVILY favors people with summons. Like, you won't be invaded by a red unless you have summons. Trust me, I had to invade for Aldrich Faithful +2 at sl250. torture. I grew to dislike the online aspect of dark souls as I played more, mostly because the netcode is something from 1997 and it's like "wow, he's not even hitting me and I'm getting hit". This is the exact thing that happened to me and I thought it was general gameplay until I read online that these were other online players. Now I play DS1 offline because I'm terrible enough without getting invaded.  Oh! Well, I'm only on Dark Souls 1 but I'll definitely keep that in mind for when I get to 3! Thanks! >helpful

you're hilarious ##TITANMASTERRACE They're so kind hearted, it's mad! >purple folk

Please! Aubergine American is the preferred nomenclature.  HEY RED! YA SCARED!? I'MMA PRACTICIN' MY STABBIN'! Players joining your world, whether benign or malevolent, are called phantoms. Seems to be a typo and it should've said generic.  He meant generic. I know it's a typo, but that sounds like something that would be *totally rad*. There are a handful of invading AIs, but they're not very common. They mostly exist to simulate invasions for offline players, but they also sort of contribute to the story (sometimes).

You can only be invaded if you are not hollow (DS1&2) or kindled (DS3). Explaining this is a bit more complicated, but basically it means you can only be invaded if you are doing pretty well and have a certain status that you can get by using items or beating bosses. The games use different methods to make it so players you invade or are invaded by should be roughly the same level as you, though there are sometimes ways around this. For example, in DS1 you could outfit a low level character with high level items (if the player is good enough to get them without leveling up), which makes it easy to grief lower level characters, but it still isn't a huge deal. Also, you can't choose who you invade, you just use an item and the game chooses someone for you (unless you make a mark which allows someone to specifically summon you as an invader).

It's all kind of complex if you haven't played the games before, but part of the fun is figuring out how it all works. There is a formula based on your level and weapon upgrades that prevent really high level players from invading low level characters. That being said, there are ways for people to move equipment from one of their characters to another, so you still see it to some degree. Also, yes, there are NPC invasions. You can also "opt out" of invasions by either not using an ember or simply by playing offline. There is invading AI. Yes, you can opt-out of invasions by playing offline (only if you're casul). You can't just invade a new player as a fully-geared PvP character because of level restrictions. The invader can only invade the world of host's within 10~ levels of them. The higher level you are, the greater that range increases. Twinking still does happen from time to time, though. Some players are good enough to clear the game at a low level and acquire all the end-game gear. Yes, there are invading AI players. However, you only get invaded when  you're "embered", which raises your health slightly and also allows you to summon friendlies (it's basically how they balance out the advantage of having 2 or more people with you to fight the enemies). Also, it takes into account how powerful you are when matching with both friendlies and invaders, so unless you pull off some cheese strats you cant grief low level players with a god char. Alternatively, you could just play offline mode, which means you won't be able to summon phantoms, but the only invaders will be the NPC ones, and they're not too difficult to kill plus they never return when defeated. There is a level range you have to be within in order to be able to invade somebody. Lots of people do deliberately not level up characters and just go through the game at low level to get super OP weapons, armor, and spells so they can gank new characters in the starting areas though, it's pretty bullshit. DS2 had a system to try and prevent this but it brought a bunch of other problems along with it so they removed it for 3 and now twinks are back.  If you opt out of invasions you aren't playing Dark Souls. no shit. i play dark souls and i still dont understand THERE'S A RING THAT DOES THAT?! I've always wondered how sometimes I'd summon someone, and they'd be coloured... Or I get summoned, and I see two "Host of Embers" running around. Sorry about that I talk like dunky alot without even knowing it because I can just binge watch his shit for hours. You've got to be kidding me. I've been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that?

I know, but it still pissed us off sometimes. Fun to set traps for them though. But most invaders don't stand a chance vs 3 competent players. Or he spams the shortsword stance thrust that has the hitbox of a fucking truck but you can't see where it is. Though when you're Aldrich Faithful, you rarely go invading alone. Usually when I got summoned to protect, there was already an invader there. 

Also, you definitely get invaded without summons. Sometimes when I was in a shitty situation and out of Estus, I'd use an ember as a last resort boost, then get invaded like a minute later and get fucking slaughtered. Try jumping Are you saying that sunbros aren't helpful? I dunno about you, but they helped me kill the nameless king. I loved playing as them. I almost always tried my best to get the guy I invaded through the area safely. The awkward tension as you approach the end and they always hesitate to lose sight of you was awesome. I like to call them Grapists.  Mate, not every purple is aubergine-American. That bonfire really tied the room together. Did. It. Not.  yeah but it's *generic*, not genetic.  In DS2, you dont need to be human to get invaded. Yeah, it's called the Untrue Dark Ring. There's also a version of the ring that makes you appear as a white phantom called the Untrue White Ring (I think). Look guys, I found the Canadians!

But wait, put a down payment of 10 mana and get a 7/7 AND your mana back guaranteed! I realize the playerbase at sl250 is significantly smaller, but I am always embered when playing through the game.

^^^^ha horse but hole try tongue I gave up on that covenant, because every time I tried to be helpful, the host just wouldn't trust me and always turned on me. What is the purple one?

A doctor of physic did once explain  
That all the earth is province elemental,  
Sure and steady as the stone-wall foursome  
A-holding up the Knave’s roof, tied together  
By power that we spake on, our traffic  
Unmarred by thy rough and idle chatter.  
And the complexion of the element  
In favour’s like the rug that ties the room.  

O, a muse of fire the first element,  
Airy breath the second; though this wind  
May well be yours for all you flap your tongue,  
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!  
Thou hast no wings, and, liable to plunge,  
You fit not fowl; yet foul your interruption,  
Fish’d for facts, yet fish you cannot be;  
So water, elemental third, you’re not,  
How much salt water thrown away in waste.  
Of earth, no woman left on earth will have thee,  
No man of middle earth will tend thy land,  
So walk the plains like to a lonely dragon; I care not.  
 No I'm Batman! I'm dealing with crippling depression! damnit Actually, it's goo goo g'joob.  Can hardly blame 'em, really. The Mound Makers attract a capricious sort. Mound-makers.  While most cooperators cannot hurt the host, and most invaders cannot hurt the PvE enemies, the Purple summons can do both.  This means that you are not really sure if they are there to help you or kill you.  Even if they start out helping you, they could just be waiting for the right time to strike.  It is pretty tense, sometimes. The mound-makers. They were considered the mad covenant. I... I was disappointed this wasn't a thing.  r/DestinyTheGame Only if you wanna go to HELL  Gooch ***Actually*** it's goo goo g' joob. (Note the space after the g') Wow, that's awesome I learn something new everyday about DS. I never really could get into the souls games though, I own all including Bloodborne, I know so much about the lore, the gameplay and characters but I can't get into it. I really loved playing as Mound Makers. I'd normally just clear enemies for the host. But if they were invaded, I'd just sit and watch the match They are playing BF1 and you are playing Dishonored.  Jesus the stabbing in this game is brutal. Okay so this makes Assassin's Creed and Shadow of Mordor much more believable where you can stab a guy right behind his friend while they are in the middle of a conversation and the guy in front won't notice. Damn this knife action in games is getting too real... The world's most prone team ever  Woodhouse? These are the kids that I was being stuck with in almost every lobby I got into yesterday...

Either not paying attention enough to see the enemy right next to them, or camping in a single area of the map (like 40 people), not capturing or really even defending...

There are some morons that play this game, way more than in COD... To be fair, my friends and I would be those causalities. 

http://imgur.com/35JHv1M is it bad that when i see stuff like this i really hope to see a friends name so i can make fun of them What's with all these obvious player gifs?  REGGGGGGIIIIIEEE! [Rampageeee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSaHusGOtpc) Man this was me in Bad Company with the Tag snatching. 

The last BF I was *good* at. You get a knife, you get a knife, and you get a knife. A genuine question from someone who is not really into BF at all:

How realistic do the kill animations need to get before you start to become disturbed by them? I remember when it was just swinging a knife and some red mist would come off the person, and then they'd just fall down. [This is all I could think of watching this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY4N5NOAsH0) I'm the guy that would spawn right in front of the guy as he was knifing my teammate, conveniently blocking the knife with my sternum Situational awareness is such a big thing in Battlefield. I havent played the current Battlefield but from playing 3 and 4, this is likely a result of people too focused on trying to get some kills rather than playing the objective. That isn't to say that killing people doesn't help but you get tunnel vision when you post up at a spot. 

If you can find a good squad that understand the value of having a variety of kits and how to find the flanking routes while PTFOing, you can run nearly every game on BF. It's that people don't think that way which ends up in easy kills for the better players.  Makes the supressor guy look like a chump Reminds me of that Halo 1 level where you butcher all the sleeping grunts  Colonel 100? Is that you? jesus christ this game is brutal Woodhouse is that you? Uhhh I made this...https://m.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/58qqyi/the_bridge_of_stabs/

 Dang! That was nuts. What game is this? It think its due to the low fov on consoles.  Man, speechstabbed Should've shouted just beforehand, 

"IM COMING FOR YOU REGGIE" You've obviously never see the Cleveland Browns play if you think that's the most oblivious team ever.  Imagine finding that scene in real life.

"Jesus, they've all been stabbed in the exact same way"  "RRRREEEEEEGGGGGGGGGGIIIIEEEEEE"

-Woodhouse It bothers me that you have a gun with a bayonet but you still pull out a knife to stab people. Obviously a soldier would use the bayonet and stay ready to fire.

Still a fun game so far though, in spite of a few glitches. That's called going Woodhouse  [Is that the colonel playing?]( http://i.imgur.com/u54bENQ.png ) They need to check themselves. Oddly satisfying.  It's amazing how much people rely on the radar lol.    This is why using a microphone is key in games like Battlefield. Just tonight I was playing with my buddies and I spawned in on my squad and got shanked immediately.  If I didn't tell them over the mic, they would all have been wiped.  GOD-LIKE u/rxtro-krxxn Why are these people never on the other team when I play? lol

(hint: it's probably because I suck) I've done this before in another game.  I got banned a minute later after being accused of cheating. this disturbs me world's* Username checks out. I get heaps excited when flanking works, it's like Christmas and Birthday rolled into one. Oh God, it's like killing children, That ... that ... that is so very violent game! Uh oh here I go killing again! I would have panicked, started shooting, kill no one AND get killed in the process Dude went Thomas Fookin Shelby on them When do you unlock the bi-pod for your knife? The bayonet charges to the back feel terrible and fucked up haha it's amazing!  Shit. Saving Private Ryan flashbacks I would say the team is cancer but at least cancer kills.  He's Winston from archer. Meanwhile, I spam the melee button and my guy strokes out and gets shot. So thats where my teamates went.  "No, I am not enemy.  I am here to give hugs.  Hold my knife." Every time I try that, an enemy in the woods sees what is going on and oneshots me from the other side of the map. you get a knife, YOU get a knife, EVERYBODY GETS KNIFED! Holy mother of repost Rrrrrrrr4rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrepostesd shit go fuck yourself Some say he's still stabbing. [Hey I had a moment like this pubbing a few years back in 1.6!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpk000-hPQ) :D Wow I'm high as fuck and this weirded me out lol. He needs to get that perk that turns corpses to ash.  High Chaos playthrough. The trench rats are gonna be a real pain in the ass  No no no, he is playing BF1 and they are being dishonored.  Lol, yes.  Perfectly describes this situation, well done. I am so fkn wet for dishonored 2, can't wait. *UH!* Knife kills. *Claps*
 It is. Part of the reason it is so good is its attention to details like this You ever kill a man with a knife in the heat a combat? Can you imagine it being anything other than brutal? It seems even more brutal when you're the one being stabbed too, scares the shit out me sometimes.  it's so good I now have a desire to stab kill someone irl 




..........if I ever decide to murder someone

again. Let's play a war game!...oh, wait, this is a little too brutal... The knife looks like it gets stuck and you have to really pull to get it out. The melee is so much fun.  A lot of people bitch about it, and its not perfect, but its awesome.   Have you not seen the sawing in Gears of War? http://musclemecca.com/imported-images/2008/11/20518250220-1.gif **ITS THE GRAVEWALKER** To be fair in real life you'd hear the guy screaming.  Butcher Pete. He's hackin' whackin and smackin That's Saving Private Ryan style shit. Brutal as fuck. yeah this is the first time where I thought "holy shit has gaming always been *that* violent?" I've been playing for 20 years, but that killing animation just looks too brutal and real.  wait until you get VR-Elbow from stabbing tens of thousands of people in your living room, and sprained ankles from VR whore stomping I thought this too. It's like the scene in _Saving Private Ryan_ where Fish is knifed to death. You squirm right along with him and also say, "no, just wait a minute, you don't have to do this." The most horrifying thing I've ever seen on the big screen. It's somehow not unlike sex in its intimacy and immediacy. Rick and Morty explored this a little bit with the beanstalk episode. The big bean tells Morty, "this is happening," while he starts to try to rape him. Not that sex must be rape, but there's that essential moment of can't-go-back-from about all three. Interesting that all three involve penetration. Is that what gives the intimacy?

Edit: Heavens, this comment has fans. But there is some fundamental relationship between sexual intercourse and other conditions from which you can't retreat. Once it's done, it can't be undone. The stabbing scene in _Saving Private Ryan_ illustrates that very well, as does the rape scene in that Rick and Morty episode. I think it speaks to the fundamentally violent nature of sexual relations, which, nonetheless, we all have to participate in. In the end, somebody is getting violated. Somebody in the relationship is getting shafted, however much we try to minimize the inequalities. For real.. half he time I skip the animations on accident cause the jump scare makes me press A lol. It's awesome. Makes knife kills feel worth it.  Prone to getting stabbed in the back That's really the only way to get C on that map. It's on a wide open bridge with some crates and barrels that are promptly destroyed. In true WW I fashion you just have to run out there lay down and hope you don't die. REGGIE! That's a lot of scalps!  ***I'll fetch a rug sir!*** I think it's more punishing being a clueless moron in COD.  You would'nt get any enjoyment so therefore it filters them out. You can still somewhat enjoy BF without having a clue how to play properly. 
Either that or the stupidity stands out more in BF, since it's more cerebral than COD. Can't wait until matchmaking and Ops are fixed. Sitting at lvl 50 in a team full of people with a couple hours of play time is pretty frustrating. Last night I was first place in a game of 32 v 32 and my K/D was 0/2 as a medic. Second place guy on my team was 18/16. 

I feel like Ops is pretty much broken right now because Defense gets team stacked immediately and everyone on Attack bails after the first battalion is lost. I've played over 40 Ops as attack and have won once.  This. Like one or two people actually trying to capture the sector, the rest running aimlessly from apples to butter or scout campers. At least this was my experience lately.  I'm so glad that I don't play games without a decent matchmaking. You get to leave those people behind within the hour of getting ranked. Damn this sounds like the game for me Let me guess. Over half your team were scouts?  I haven't experienced this stuff everyone claims yet on ps4 conquest. Sure, ive gotten my ass kicked, but the teams i get put in do actually try.  It's kinda strange that as games get more real they need higher levels of understanding of actual warfare tactics for players stay competitive. "Susie" who is six and "Alfred" who is eight, might have better tactical understanding than drunken "Bob" from accounting who is 28 and just wants to spend his friday night having some fun in a game. Hey, I'm not a moron, I know perfectly well who to shoot. I just can't hit the fuckers. So far I haven't really encountered many terrible teammates, but what I did in BF4 was switch squads until you find one that's playing the way you want. 1 or 2 good squads can really turn the tide of the whole battle, especially balanced ones It's because right now theres a lot of noobs who just bought the game. In a year, it will just be us old timers. During the closed release there was a lot more experienced players and it felt like attackers where always winning operations  I also think the general fanbase of COD takes the game more seriously. Back when I used to play COD I would try my heart out every game. But in BF I'm that one asshole sitting on a rooftop laughing my ass off with three friends in a discord call. I try not to take any game other than CSGO serious.  10-15 year olds have superior twitch-reflexes and fine motor muscle control (not to mention more free time) and so excel at the shooting mechanics of games like COD, but older, more experienced gamers generally have better understanding of tactics and strategy and can get into positions like this [deleted] Like the bunker, CP'B' in the Italian mountains. Just camp inside and it's impossible to capture. That also describes Insurgency pretty well.

Campers all over the map while the objective gets taken (or not taken, depending on team). Then we lose. It's realistic, everyone in WW1 was about 15 years old  Does nobody look at the mini map?! let the hardcore servers sort em out I know a guy that only plays snipers and goes like 2 and 7 every game. When I look at his xbox recordings he makes, they're of him seeing and ignoring guys flanking the rest of our squad, and trying to hit a guy laying in a tower a mile away. Needless to say he gets yelled at a lot. I've raged quit this game a couple times because no one seems to understand how to win or even progress the game mode. BF1 has more clueless players than other battlefields I've played. Probably because of the hype, which caused people who never played bf before to get this one  I would be in a different causality where I was a casualty ;) This is the top comment on so many /r/gaming threads Where's this gif from? you are the young generation old one complains about  I would think it's pretty obvious.  I could use some of these people playing Titanfall 2. People's spacial awareness is un-fucking-real between running on walls and headshotting me from across the map before they destroy my Titan.  Because the game is complete chaos. with 32 teammates and 32 enemies running around a single point it can be hard to tell who's who unless you PRESS Q AND MARK THE ENEMIES! Hate to be that guy, but... it's "oblivious" not obvious Wasn't me... You dropped this "L". Tbh I think this ones a fake If /r/gaming is anything to go by, most of the time spent playing a battlefield game on a console looks like this. I was hoping someone posted this. Since I can't afford gold, here's some silver Underrated comment Remember the Gol? Or heavy metal?

That game was fantastic.  God, Bad Company 2 was such a good game. I got BF1 based off of my love for it and it's great. Shame I have no way to flaunt all my knife kills. The weapon medals were probably my favorite part of BC2. The knife animation was broken shit and worked half the time, but I cherished my platinum knife. Yes dude, used to have a squad I'd play with regularly on there and never fucking lost. Battlefield is great if you play it right Everybody gets a knife! Battlefield actually doesn't have nearly as much violence as it could. If there was dismemberment or gore in the game, holy crap it would be a bloodbath.

As is the sound design is more disturbing than the visuals, imo. Each of these knife kills comes with sucking sounds as the knife goes in and out, along with the screams. Club kills you can hear bone breaking. It's quite gruesome, but nothing gaming hasn't done many times before. [deleted] Thanks to my 27 months in Iraq I suffer from PTSD. BF gives me absolutely zero issues. At the same time I pretty much can't watch any war movies. The human mind is a fickle bitch.  It might get you the first few times but since the animation is the same each time it's easy to become detached from the level of violence after a while. Then you go do a school shooting or something. Honestly I consider myself not good around that type stuff, for good reasons. But I've seen 10x, if not worse, than anything bf does and it doesn't bother me at all in a game.

It's a game, if it was real life then yeah, nope. Unless it was to protect someone else i'm noping out of that. Once we pass over the Uncanny Valley,  where it borders on photo realism (we're not quite there yet in the gaming world) this will actually become a problem. To answer your question more simply, once we reach the point of where CG in games is completely indistinguishable from reality, then PTSD may become a problem... However at that point, I think that the gaming industry will resort to "hollywood" violence and gore, since most people can distinguish that from reality.  As long as I can tell they are video game characters it won't be disturbing, but if you start pulling out some black mirror shit, I'm done. Try doing a knife kill in onward. Need a Vive first. It can be a little disturbing. Not even red mist. In BF2 the hits made dust come out of people. Really annoying when you hit a guy, dust flies out yet it doesn't register as a hit. Still happens 10 years later... I feel bad every time I melee or bayonet someone, but it's kill or be killed.

And getting revenge on a guy with an embarrassing knife kill is oh so sweet. The weird thing is it's not the blood and core that really get me. It's the look of fear in his eyes when he gets stabbed. Like in that instant I can see a flag in my head of him kissing his wife and kid goodbye at the train station or something...

Jesus I need a drink now... That's not the kind of stabbing Roy Brown was singing about ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) They were on the objective, but that point is just a narrow bridge. They're literally playing the objective, the prone players are all capping C and this guy probably ran up from behind them from the direction on their own spawn. There was even that one sleeping standing up. There was even that one sleeping standing up. Or first Mw mission on an actual mission where you shoot or stab all them while sleeping  He'd kill them all with one swing of a sabre REGGIEEEEEEEEE! Battlefield One Or all the locked fucking squads.  You can change the fov in the options. I thought the gif was zoomed in. Fov is adjustable on console. "You scoundrel! Is that brandy?"

"No, sir. Water."

"Never touched the stuff. Fish fuck in it."  REGGIE!!!! before they wreck themselves In my experience, the radar is the most neglected tool at the soldiers' disposal and most people don't look at it nearly as often as they should. SAVAGE! As someone who was taught to play 1.6 from pirated flash drive copies on high school computers by a semi-pro German foreign exchange student I'm having terrified flashbacks right now. He'd go 1v10 and destroy us without batting an eye  Oh man, that strafe jumping, classic And then you were kicked for "hacking."

 Right? I cant get passed how they really fucking show these guys dying after being stabbed, watch it at a slower speed, their faces are brutal
 Or just get blink. Real players don't use the perks.
Jk That's coming in the WWII DLC "Shadow Kill" I think?

EDIT: Yup Watch out for those Trench Weepers man. I preordered it. Please don't be another No Man's Sky So good I have PTSD.  Well with ISIS and all I'd imagine we all have a crash-course in disembowelment.   Games gotta' live up to the crowd. And people still buy Call of Duty.  Dice really marketed the stabbing and meleeing for BF1. Idk if i'd call it paying attention to detail that saving private ryan scene, gets me everytime. No, and yes. I killed a man with a knife in the heat of combat -AMA!

^^^^^Not-IRL-YMMV No man it should be more like CoD where you just fling your hand and the baddie falls down Dude getting bayonet charged from behinds makes me jump 99% of the time. 

I sit so close to my TV so the screen covers my field of vision, it scares the absolute fuck out of me Kind of like the way I stab your mom with my dick when you're asleep. Needs sequel... You can't scream with your throat ripped out. From stab wounds like the video?

No, especially not at those angles. You'd be so shocked it's like having the wind sucked out of you. Can't scream when this is happening.

Christopher Lee knows how it is when people get stabbed. Actually in Basic we were taught to kidney punch and then do what ever, as that would pretty much keep em quiet. That's what the director of the Lord of Rings movies thought until Christopher Lee explained [that's not what people getting stabbed sound like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TQARRckm6U) 

Context: Christopher Lee was British Special Ops around WW2, and was probably around/behind a few stabbed people Choppin' that meat!  I think that song is about sex Grandma plays the numbers  HACKS, WHACKS, CHOPPIN' THAT MEAT. And jacking The Whackin in question:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY4N5NOAsH0 CHOPPIN THAT MEAT *Wackin' and smackin'* You rang?  Fucking Upham. You should watch the battlefield 4 video that shows you killing them and taking their dog tags in slow motion. Their eyes actually show a lot of emotion and it's super sad  Well I'm pretty sure BF1 is supposed to be super brutal in an accurate sort of way. WW1 was a pretty fucked up war. The first time someone did the shovel killing animation in BF1 to me I freaked the fuck out that shit was gross as dicks. I mean graphics were bound to get good enough someday. Check out Spec Ops: The Line sometime.  Those finishing moves get pretty brutal toward the end of the game. Really? Looked pretty standard to me. A couple of the assassins creed games - the animations get insanely violent far more than in battlefield. Like the pike slashes through their entire head, or you cut their jugular and blood spills out of their mouth. Battlefield was the first war game where I really noticed npcs basically having ptsd or crying in the fetal position during the campaign too afraid to fight  I used to be a tea-bagger like you, until I took a coffeetable to the knee. those slow stabs as they look into the eyes of the person about to kill them desperately pleading them to stop always gives me a strange feeling in my gut Solid copypasta material wtf > Somebody in the relationship is getting shafted, however much we try to minimize the inequalities.

... he said aloud while typing the words.

cuttysark9712 leaned back in his chair and chortled softly to his own masochistic thoughts, inspired by the pleas for mercy squealed from within the throne's strut. With a thoughtful stroke of his neckbeard he reviewed the post meticulously before submitting his words.

cuttysark9712 leaned forward again. Slowly this time... producing a long creak of agony which, coupled with his post, filled him with a rampant glee. The excited squeal burst from within. "Surely, my insight knows no bounds!" In this moment he was the bright and shining center of the universe. The savior of Earth and its people.

Then some jerkass redditor has to go and ruin it with shitpost replies. Your comment reminds me of [this image](http://i.imgur.com/Ya7N9MK.jpg) Sex doesn't need to involve penetration while still being just as intimate. So no, it's not the penetration. There's a scene in the film "Irreversible" that's more brutal. Single shot for way, way longer than is comfortable. I won't spoil / ruin it but it's by far the most intense I've ever seen. The can't-go-back moment exists because penetration is inherently binary. You are either stabbed, or you are not. 

Also, it's not the stabbing that makes things intimate in that circumstance, it's death. Virginity, Death, Rape, all binary states. You either are or you aren't. huh? what does pressing a do * ba dum tss * This reads like a knock knock joke Did you two set this up? You smoke it, then proceed to get 3 gas grenades and 2 frag grenades thrown at you. Yeah but one of those guys could turn around and at least alert them to Stabby McStabFace back here. _In a whorehouse_

REGGIE! I shout this whenever I kill more than one person with melee.  One of the only time Archer actually seems scared.  I think all of your points are valid, and I would add that there is just MORE people in a normal Battlefield game; anywhere from two to almost ten times as many.

I don't know, maybe it just FELT like my friends and I were the only ones doing ANYTHING... oh, right, we came in 1-2-3 on the team by thousands of points.

Anyway, the game is incredible and I'm glad I cancelled the IW pre-order 2 days before the game came out. Actually it's far more fun to be a clueless moron in COD, because at least you get to wallrun to capture point and get sniped instead of just walking.  Everyone keeps saying defence is easier but I have found it's pretty balanced! I only play 40 player Ops, 64 is a clusterfuck! Maybe that makes a difference.

edit: spelling Can you explain why 0/2 is better than 18/16? EXACTLY what I've been experiencing. The worst thing I've found in ops is on the Italy/Austria Hungary scenario with the mountain valley map in the 3rd sector with the bunkers. Team caps the bunker point and 80% of them lemming off to the next point ignoring that there are 20+ enemies in the bunker below the point. So they leave and the enemy caps the point back. Just fucking stay and break through the bunker before you move on, you lemming shitcans. Ugh. Easy karma Every single time. Parks and rec my brain hurts the more times I read this you accidentally a word I wouldn't. I could use some on Battlefront PC also.  Yea, I don't know what it is but it's kinda harder to keep track of enemies in battlefield. I don't get why either because it seems about the same kind of experience when you play call of duty hardcore, where there's no enemy markers over the opposing team. One thing about that really bothers me is making an extra menu for the quick actions like saying thanks or requesting ammo. In Bf4 it was really quick, now I've died like 10 times while trying to request an order or ammo. It's really not that difficult unless people are playing with their sound muted. I would've heard someone being stabbed nearby and turned around, as would most people on PC I imagine. Obliviously we all knew what he meant M95 Red-dot for life! >'member the Gol? 'Member heavy metal??

Oh I 'member!! Why did you like heavy metal? It's so open and it's one of the most punishing maps if the teams are unbalanced. I just got done with a match in BF1 I'm so ashamed of everyone. 

No spotting, joined every squad before I created my own to set targets. 

The first dreadnought got to 54 percent health from one boat sitting there shooting at it because nobody picked it off.

The second dreadnought was empty except for me the entire time it was up.

I don't care how unpopular of an opinion it is, this game needs a MANDATORY tutorial. 2 minutes with each class, and a minute on spotting an enemy and setting an objective.

Don't even teach tactics or tips. Nobody knows how to effing play and it's a freaking wreck. holy shit, I'm just imagining with the rag dolls like half the body flying one way while the other half in the other direction. I wish Battlefield had limbs and shit flying off like World at War, but then a medic wouldn't be able to revive me >  actually doesn't have nearly as much violence as it could

heh heh, Soldier of Fortune II - Thanks Raven Software. And it would be badass.  I use the axe/hatchet as melee weapon and the sound it makes when you hack it into the chest or back of your enemy is just cruel.

Also men that scream like little girls while beeing on fire and burning to death is pretty disturbing. The sound in this game is on another level! Virtual war has conditioned you brotha.  I wonder why? Do you think it is because of a difference in setting/time period, or just because it isn't real people/actors? Mom?  Aaaand your on the watchlist. . I dont think it will ever be ptsd levels. In the end you are still sitting in your chair playing a game. Yes it is brutal and gruesome but if its too much you just stop playing. In war you cant just nope out of the battle. The life and death factor is key. Desensitization? yes. Trauma? no Uncanny valley is when it's very real looking but something about it is "off" making it creepy. If it's REALLY real looking then it wouldn't be a problem. Oh got it. Thanks! I noticed that too.  Why the fuck are people doing that. It's like, great, every single fucking squad has 2 people in them and are all locked. Guess I'm going solo. It pisses me off a bit. Domino* Flesh and Steel is the only way to go. Dammit.. time to restart I do not need another reason to play that game AGAIN.  But now I have to.  And just in time for 2 Now I want to watch a playthrough completely without perks to see if it's possible.  Real players are undetected no kills Legit did a stealth run with only blink. Never killed ANYONE. Lol, got a good laugh when I could sense the fear of being downvoted with the "jk". Upvote purely for that. Hahaha truuuf, but I think the risk of that is low, we already have a proven formula for dishonored, and there's nothing outlandish about it. Just a fun ass game. >  Please don't be another No Man's Sky

Yeah, there's not a snowballs chance of that happening, worst case it's your usual sequel disappointment.  I've got shellshock and trenchfoot :( That's what I expect from VR when it gets good enough.  Well, it is attention to detail. WW1 was a brutal fucking war, and the close quarters aspect was very real. It's easier to justify shooting at enemies because they're far enough away that you can remove yourself. Hell they're shooting too. You don't have to look them in the eye when they're dying. It may not even have been you who hit them! As an aside here, this does not mean that any psychological issues that arise from these events are any less serious. I don't mean to portray it that way if it comes across that way. 

But in a trench? Yeah you're gonna see a few people's faces as they die. You'd see how really, you and that person were not really that different. You'd have a human moment with someone you killed. 

That is a huge detail of that war, because there was no real "honor". European nations had been at war for a long time before this, but they had been a gentleman's affair. Very proper, with lots of rules and regulations because you had to be ever so proper. You didn't have many snipers, if any. Artillery wasn't unseen death from above. There wasn't a mass charge into guns that mowed men down by the hundreds. It was as clean as war could be. They were people you were fighting. Not your people, but people (not how non Europeans were treated btw). Then you have WW1 where everyone has a nickname. The first war where we really see us doing the most we could to disconnect the enemy from us. Making them monsters instead of merely the enemy, and all because it makes it easier to kill someone whose "a damn dirty hun" than it is to kill someone whose the same age as you are , fighting for the same reason, and feels just the same as you. As a note, soldiers did do this before WW1, but generally the government didn't nail it into every soldier before shipping them out, much less the population who the soldiers would be drawn from.

These brutal, face to face encounters, break that illusion. No longer is this a damn dirty hun, it's a scared kid who now has to face the fact that he's going to die, and the person who did it is faced with the fact that "holy shit, this could've been me". 

Or DICE could have just thought brutal looked better. It still does show how brutal the war was, and WW1 is usually just glossed over in terms of how truly awful it was. So either way, I love it, even if it makes me feel a bit bad.  "Shhhhhhh." What this scene? https://youtu.be/KBSQEnvz6zo

I'm sorry. Ah, yes. Trench warfare.  /slow clap I didn't know I was playing on Xbox Live! If you were cold blooded you would hold eye contact with him as you slowly penetrated her.

In her asshole.  Kind of like the way I stab my mom with your dick when you're asleep. Wait... I hope it goes in the direction that Assassin's Creed went, where the first one was really good but shallow and repetitive and the sequel really became great.  At least an extended dlc. I'd pay 20-30 no question.  Okay, you'd hear him gurgling blood. butcher Pete has a long sharp knife, he starts choppin and don't know when to stop.  all you fellas gotta watch your wives . Cause Pete don't care whose meat he chops What kind of sex do you have?  It is. It's a song about sex disguised as a "butcher cutting meat" metaphor which is then disguised as a murder metaphor...until you hear part two and realize it can't be about murder. Yeah I dunno. It sounds like both sex and a metaphor for cutting women up.  There's definitely a lot about penetration  Double entendre "Hey, Grandma, did you get your numbers yet?"

"WELL, SUCK A DICK, SON!" *Finale to Swan Lake plays* Link? Not brual enough, though. People bailing out of aircraft instead of going out guns blazing is EXACTLY why Command didn't like issuing parachutes early in the war. Stop this right now before it begins.  Right. Your comment made me look at it from the stabber's point of view.Yikes! But, in time of war... This really makes me wish for an afterlife, for the peace of mind of the stabbers. You... You've lost me. Do you think I said something that is copypasta? Or do you think I've said something that is fodder for copypasta? I'm not even 100% sure what copypasta is. My brain absolutely read this as "da bum tits". 0.o Someone else who uses smoke! There are dozens of us! I've struggled with this across several different games tonight. FPS and otherwise. 

*Get on the point. I know you want to protect your k/d. But you need to play the objective or we lose get on the point right the fuck now.* 

It got so bad I had to go have some alone time and play metro last light.  Tell me about it, i'll consistently be 18-20k every match with the nearest teammate being 12k in points because they all sit at the middle of the map, where the entire enemy team is also sitting, just spamming shots down a street and throwing gas grenades instead of flanking. And that's the key, you had a squad that played correctly. Try having to try to sneak around a capture flags alone. Doesn't usually work, so sometimes you just have to join in on the losing strategy so you don't rake in a nice 2-10 KD I think you might be right in that 40 player Ops might be better for balance.  I originally thought defending is easier, but ive found that really only pertains to monte gruppa. i dont really play the sinai op, but i know the ottomans usually win it i forget if they defend or attack... anyways. ive played about 16 hours now and on the first two ops its def pretty damn balanced on 64 mode. defense in iron walls monte grappa is OP af, bunker after bunker after bunker He's saying his score was the highest on his team even without a single kill. He played his role and the objective most likely and did his part.  As someone else noted, this is just the kill/death ratio; however, placement is determined by a score value, which kills factor into. That being said, kills are not the only method of gaining score; since he played medic, he would receive points whenever he healed or revived a teammate. The other classes in the game (assault, support, and scout) have similar methods of gaining points without directly getting kills. Support class gets points for resupplying allies, scout gets additional points by using various tools to spot enemies (marks them on mini-map and puts a little red mark above their head), and assault has anti-vehicle tools that give points when damaging enemy vehicles or stationary weapons. Points can also be obtained by capturing or defending objectives, or by performing certain special bonuses (things like assists, squad wipes, avenging ally deaths, melee kills, multikills, savior kills, killing elite enemy units-i.e. flame troopers, sentry gunners, anti armor specialists). Battlefield is very good about rewarding points for many different actions that contribute towards team success, which allows for many different play styles, and BF1 in particular has a very robust point system. Kills give a base of 20 points plus however much damage you did to the enemy, so if you kill an enemy without assistance, you get 120 points, whereas if you strike the final blow, the points will be lower. Objectives generally reward more points; I primarily have experience in conquest mode (think domination style, where there are multiple objective flags/points that can be captured, held, or lost and reward score to the team that currently controls them) and capturing objectives is worth something around 500 points. Things like spotting, resupplies, revives, or heals reward various amounts of points depending on how much they are performed (healing someone from near death back to full health will be worth more than fixing minor damage), but they generally fall below 100 points (they occur more frequently though). Hopefully I did a good job of explaining it all. It's either that, or why can't the ____ on my team do that, they always just _____ off >redditor for 6 years    
  
this guy checks out Your username is more relevant than mine shall ever be.

I envy you. .. People playing? BF is much much more difficult to master than COD in terms of movement and tactics. Gun play is very important but less so than positioning and cover. It's also important to know when to concede ground and go somewhere else and to recognize weak areas and move on in. Sometimes you DONT shoot at people just because you can see them. You need to get to a flag and start capping rather than attract attention to yourself and your squad or other teammates.  they don't stand out like in CoD. sometimes your silhouette on the horizon gives you away but you can blend in if your in the right terrain You should try Arma. Half the time you are just looking for muzzle flashes half a click away. It is usually better to search for a teammate (in case of trying to get ammo) with the assault class and hit the Spot-button while aiming at him. This will automatically request ammo.

But to be honest. Most of the time you will be ignored anyway even if you have 2 HP left and spamming the medic with heal requests... I've seen a lot of complaints about this. I snap off requests in less than a second. Sometimes I mess up but it's rlly not as bad as everyone is saying it is. It's just different.  The best cancer I ever experienced  >Gol 

There's why :b Sign me up. I wish battlefield had gibbing like WAW. You should check out Killing Floor 2, highly recommend the microwave gun for maximum gore. You have clearly never played red orchestra 2. Nothing more brutal then having artillery bomb your team and pieces raining everywhere. How cool would it be if there was a hardcore mode where the characters just got annihilated? Honestly I would be content with cod Waw level gore. It would just add more to the immersion.   So this is what it's like to be a real soldier, when real war they're okay with but video games give them PTSD Yes, Kevin?  you're  His what's on the watchlist? Watch WestWorld! Isn't that like s3e2?  That's the whole point of the Uncanny Valley though, once we pass over it, we won't be able to help but identify what we see as real. People have been psychologically damaged from watching beheading videos, which is what watching accurate post Uncanny Valley violence would feel like. Drone pilots get PTSD from what they have to see, and they're sitting in a chair watching what's going on from the safety of a TV screen. I kinda wish Flesh and Steel was COMPLETELY flesh and steel. IIRC there were certain parts of the game that you had to use Blink for. This dude is brutal...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35eVOUv4uEk I wrote *A Farewell to Noobs* I've got no bananas :( You're supposed to put your socks in the wash! And I'm pretty sure mom told you to stop wearing those funky smelling boots you bought at the surplus store while you game, it cuts off your circulation. Well said. While BF1 isn't perfect, it absolutely nails certain immersive aspects. 

One of the very best moments I've ever had as a gamer is when my brother and I tried Operations for the first time the other week, and we took that first sector on Ballroom Blitz and then heard that incredible sound design of the American attackers yelling and charging into the next area. My brother and I both started yelling into our mics and sprinting madly, and it's just this huge fucking wave of our troops rushing up over the hill, men are getting picked off left and right by snipers, explosions everywhere, we make it to one of the foxholes/craters and dive in and we're both just pinned down with chaos all around... I'll never forget how incredible that was. 

We're all hunting for those legendary moments in games where you're simply in awe of what you're experiencing, where you totally escape into another world. That was definitely one of them for me and it was cool to share it with my bro. 

 You're taking his comment way in the wrong direction. He is just saying the ubiquitousness of melee  in game is an arcadey element meant to promote the as brutal feeling as opposed to being realistic. Actual stabbing a guy instead of shooting him would be very uncommon.

Similarly the devs make mgs more accurate the longer the trigger is held, to make it feel like a suppressive weapon, even though irl they are more accurate and generally more effective in short bursts.  Fucking Upham Shit's like the Marianas Trench. Trenchwars is just one of the arenas. The game you're thinking of is Continuum (formerly SubSpace). /slowly contracts clap And then the series gradually gets run into the ground overtime until everyone is sick of it, just like AC. I'm deaf so probably not if that was the only thing to hear. But on the battlefield, there are sounds of gunshots and people shouting and screaming which is more than drowning out the sound of someone whose throat is ripped out. No you will not hear him gurgling blood.  He's hackin' whackin' and smackin'

He's hackin' whackin' and smackin'

^^He's ^^hackin' ^^whackin' ^^and ^^smackin' The kind where only one of the bodies is warm  Personally, I'm a sixty minute man. 

Actually, no. Both myself and my girlfriend would get bored and uncomfortable twenty minutes in.  COMPLETELY NORMAL SEX No, it's a metaphor for having sex with women...and men, too. If you listen to the lyrics, Pete basically goes around having sex with every woman he meets, and then after he goes to jail, he has sex with his cell mate.

If you've heard part 2 of the song, the women whose meat Pete "chopped" all paid his bail and were waiting for him to get out so he could "chop their meat" again, they want to execute him because he's fucking everyone's wives, but when they try to put him in the electric chair, he fucks the chair to pieces.

It's not about murder, it's about sex. Between the two, murder was actually *less* controversial to make a song about back then. 3, 6, 9

Well whaddaya know? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9UHOXrlRc https://youtu.be/Wh54Ec7u4yA
This isn't a bf4 but it'll do the job I don't see any good ones for Battlefield 4, but here's a [Battlefield 3](https://youtu.be/wRmzHwJqxAo) one. Stop right there criminal scum! It's weird how war can make two humans who have had no knowledge of each other be In a situation like this. I mean religious war almost makes more sense. If they both dropped the knife then they would be just two guys hangin out in a room. Yeah those poor stabbers.... What if they just don't exist anymore?  I think that's Internet for "quotable." Don't get me wrong, it's a solid comment. But it also has everything going for it to be a dank copypasta- completely unironic in its delivery, totally bizarre out of context, unexpected Rick and Morty reference (the bean king rapist nonetheless)- this is gold fam. I would... but I find setting people on fire to be more effective :) dozens! ive posted this a few times in here that if you care about k/d dont play ops or conquest cause that mentality really fucks the team. and if you insist on playing objective based modes then play the objective and reconcile your k/d on tdm I don't understand people who camp like bitches to protect their K/D.

I just fucking charge in like rambo, get 5 kills, then die. The rest of the team breaks through and I get revived.

If you camp like a nob, someone will eventually kill you. Then when you go to respawn, the other team has overrun the bloody map because you aren't helping, and you'll die 8 times before getting a single kill because you're being surrounded and gangbanged with bullets. Metro last light is one of my all time fav games, gold choice  A is almost taken by enemy, close to cap but your squadmates are there. Spawn on squad, turns out they were 50m from the cap zone. Run into A, A gets capped and you get shot to death. In your death cam you see your squadmate get 1 kill before dying. It'd be much better IMHO if the primary stat measured was wins-lossess instead of kills-deaths. Yes, your W/L would be much more dependent on the quality of your teammates and it WOULD go down a lot of the time because of their unforgivable idiocy but it would encourage more objective/team play instead of half a team of snipers with six kills and no deaths at the end of a match This is so bad in Overwatch right now. I always get a higher K/D when I play the objective anyways. I don't understand the campers who never drop meds or ammo and end up with 10 kills and 2000 points in a full length conquest match. It can't be that fun playing like that.  I've always thought W/L ratio shows who the better players are compared to K/D. People who play the objective tend to win more. It does suck when your team doesn't help out, but games can be won by one squad when the other team is playing like yours. 

I don't understand being obsessed with K/D if you're going to play objective game modes. My brother and I play a lot of conquest. My K/D is usually better, but he still scores as much as me every game because we both play the objective. He's just more impatient. Haha. There are people every game who go like 20-5, and they are in the bottom 50% of the leaderboard every time. 

Playing domination on COD, you can get away with sniping the whole game to protect a flag because it's only 6 v 6. I've seen people go 40-0 without capping a flag, and they have the highest score in the game. It's so broken.  Tell that to my retard friend that goes to the edge of the map in conquest and never moves so he can go 4 and 0. What a coincidence that games with him seem to end much sooner. BF is infinitely more fun when played with other people.

Even one other person means you'll have a MUCH better chance of playing objectives and staying alive, two is heaven, and if you have a full squad of friends this game becomes one of the most fun I've ever played (so far).

Just gotta get more people on the BF train... too many COD holdouts. To You should probably post more often in r/DnD Yeah, that too. :) But, the ones who still are playing are far from derpy.  Engagement distance is the single most central gameplay mechanic in BF1.

It reminds me of boxing. I haven't played BF or CoD (lately, at least) but from the videos I see, CoD's background vs enemies contrast is much higher than in BF. Sounds thrilling  Sniping with Neostead slug rounds. Quake II is right this way! I'd feel terrible reviving the incendiary grenade victims.  

I'd still *do* it, just feel a little bad.

Gotta get them points.  S3e2 is soooooort of comparable, buy not overly. Something like that will most likely be the future though. but in the end you would still know there is no consequence to your actions. nobody you see die was actually harmed in real life. I would posit that the knowledge of it being a game has a major effect on damage as apposed to a real event witnessed.  I think there's still a huge difference. I see real violence recorded and it absolutely is disturbing, watching someone get attacked and you know it's real.

Watching something that looks real that you know isn't, I'm always detached from it. I know someone isn't suffering. I honestly see no problem with BF1 and hearing screams and shit. I know I'm in a game. There's no adrenaline from thinking I'm going to die or anything like that.

But if I watch a video of a guy getting punched in a real video, it's hard for me to watch. I don't like seeing people get hurt if it's real. That is disturbing to me.

I think I would be mostly fine if games got super realistic and it was just some ridiculously realistic war game. It might be really strange to see people get killed realistically, but most of me knows it's bullshit. We grew up our whole lives seeing people get killed on TV. I think people have developed somewhat of immunity to fake death.  Yea but that's because their actions are killing real life people. In video games it's violent, but you're not actually killing anyone in real life.  Your agreement really isn't valid since there are still people actually dying. They actually ended a real living thing. Not saying what you're saying isn't possible  but they are actually killing real people and are somewhat forced into doing so. They have to follow to order to bomb the person or face consequences. In a game you are not required to do anything and it is not real.  Perhaps reaching the Uncanny Valley requires some sort of artificial nervous system stimulation that helps them forget that what they did wasn't real. Can't wait to see what he does with Dishonored 2.  The stabbing is so brutal, this gif alone has me on the phone with my editor about my new book, *All's Quiet and Where's My Team*.

It's honestly comments like this that make me absolutely love going through random posts and reading comments and replies because this shit had me dying laughing haha  Her name is Susan!

"What do we even do now?"

"Just keep grinding I guess." You just need to learn how to ride the Rocket 69. Holy shit, 40s and 50s music is perverted.  IMO this is nothing more than the [Kuleshov effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuleshov_effect)

> Kuleshov edited a short film in which a shot of the expressionless face of Tsarist matinee idol Ivan Mosjoukine was alternated with various other shots (a plate of soup, a girl in a coffin, a woman on a divan). The film was shown to an audience who believed that the expression on Mosjoukine's face was different each time he appeared, depending on whether he was "looking at" the plate of soup, the girl in the coffin, or the woman on the divan, showing an expression of hunger, grief or desire, respectively. The footage of Mosjoukine was actually the same shot each time. Vsevolod Pudovkin (who later claimed to have been the co-creator of the experiment) described in 1929 how **the audience "raved about the acting... the heavy pensiveness of his mood over the forgotten soup, were touched and moved by the deep sorrow with which he looked on the dead child, and noted the lust with which he observed the woman. But we knew that in all three cases the face was exactly the same**."[1] He just did a BF1 one too, and damn the animations are even more gut wrenching in BF1.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W4uljv4ijc Wow that was really well done  Holy cow what weirdly good production quality Why does BF4 look that good? It doesn't ingame.  What's the song?

I love it! At 3:40 this guy got a fucking bipod for his knife like why the fuck lol thought that the BF friends video was playing around guess it's legit That's a perfectly natural way to look at it. But look at it from the stabber's point of view. He's just killed someone whom he is no better than. Why should he have died and not me, such a stabber will _always_ wonder. No reason, will be the conclusion he will rightly come to. It's just luck. And my luck will run out one day, he will also reason, if he is reasonable. The horror of war is fully derived from Plato's and Socrates' conception of justice, which was the main thing they were worried about. And so you get the "moral injury" U.S. drone pilots are on about. I feel fully lost. Yes, I was being unironic; I want to understand these things. Don't you? /u/cuttysark9712 +non-ironic mention of penetration  Last night I got the flame trooper kit and went on a sadistic rampage. Is it really that effective? I haven't used anything else than grenades, and I'm level 30 lol Impact grenade really does fuck guys up I was even having problems on tdm tonight because no one would get the fuck out of the spawn. Meaning they'd get spawn-raped causing us to hemorrhage tickets, and then I'd get hammered because I didn't have anyone else sharing the pain far forward. 

I was consistently top of our teams board tonight- which is a bad sign. Because I *kinda suck*. So if I'm the best on the team we're gonna fuckin' lose. I had to bail to a single player because it got so painful. The kids who go to objective games to boost their KD aren't good enough to do well in tdm. They can only get kills by completely disregarding the objective and killing people from stupid, strategically useless spots.  ok what i dont get is why most ppl in the BF subs bitch abt objectives, and the others bitch abt them not killing anyone.

when i play im gettin a ton of kills anyways plus points from the objectives so idk if im alone or what the issue is cause im puttin in equal work on both places See, that logic works the opposite way for those who care about K/D. They specifically play objective based modes because it's easier to keep their ratio up since many of their targets will be worried about the objective instead of only worrying about kills.


It's lame, but that's how it is for some of these kids. Or just learn how to go positive and play the objective. I like how Titanfall 2 doesnt even show your deaths in some game types. Makes more sense in objective based modes. Ah, the pains of being a support. Fuck your k/d, my job is keeping your dumb asses alive. Yeah, when you play aggressive, even if your KD is a little lower you get way higher volume kills, far more points, and have more fun. Oh, and help your team win the game. 

That's not to say camping scouts don't have a place, they do, but you shouldn't do it with a KD mentality. It should be a support your teams movements/firefights mentality.  Yeah man sometimes you just have to throw bodies at the point if you want to have a prayer of winning. Because sometimes 2 or 3 survive and turn the tide. See Carl Gustav on Infantry. Make Gibbing Great Again Oh man, what if reviving them just left them a screaming black pile of agony? The wonders of morphine I guess. For what it's worth, PTSD comes from all things, not just killing people. I can tell you from experience, it can be triggered just by witnessing violence, even without participating in it. I've never felt traumatised by a video game, but watching the GIF above, it doesn't seem like a leap. (Not trying to call you out, just thought the perspective might be worth contributing.) "All's Quiet, PTFO" turns out they're talking about *sex* The other side is in fallout 4 too. Who said anything about her being Jewish? Our music does away with innuendo and instead goes for full frontal assault.  Van Damme effect is basically the same but the audience does not see the different emotions at all. What's with the weird warpy effects? Is that coming from the game or did he edit that in? PC I was actually looking for exactly that as I saw your comment. If you find it let me know. If I do I'll link for you.  You delivered a great comment but if taken fully out of context it will make a great unexpected comment.  You won on both fronts.  >  Because I kinda suck. So if I'm the best on the team we're gonna fuckin' lose.

This is how I view myself when playing, too.  "Oh, I'm the top player on this team.  We're totally not going to win this if *that* keeps up." Did you at least enjoy the SP? lol apparently the scouts' place is along the edge of every map to annihilate me if I ever stop moving to cap.  Carl Gustav on a darted infantry. To be fair, they were all ON the objective... that bridge is the C flag. >PTFO

Post traumatic fuck out? "Single women, married women, old maids and all"

I think around when they started talking about "butchering" my grandma I figured it out. Oh wow was that literally the other side of the record? If that's true then that's amazing that he actually sings it! Holy hell that was a good bad joke. https://i.imgur.com/VbZBRRs.jpg r/jesuschristreddit  That comment was 🔥🔥🔥 [removed] Why are y'all talking about my ashtray? 👍 Who said anything about the Jew being a her? Well she has been in the shower a long time. It doesn't look that good maxed out on my PC.  Ether -silent partner Well... thanks Fuck yeah bud. I bailed to Metro last light redux and it always gives me the warm and fuzzies, when I'm not rage quitting because *how the fuck can I possibly be expected to survive this* I don't get how people play games like this. Just sitting, scoped on one area, taking one shot and then waiting another 5 minutes for some sucker like me to move across the map Darting a camping friendly sniper in the face Push The Fucking Objective! "but when they came to pay his bail, they found him choppin' on his cell mate" Yeah Pete gets out of jail and keeps hackin', whackin', and smackin' until he gets the chair, but then he hacks, whacks, and smacks the electric chair. Joke? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Internet_Defense_Force That genuinely made me laugh, and as a Jewish person myself, I bless this joke as being kosher  because you put it in my cumbox.

Her argument is something along the lines of "Everything you do in your life is something you can't go back from, barring time travel, so that first bit is nonsense. And as to penetration. If you go to a surgeon, have you been violated? Probably not in the sense you mean it here."


Which is also sort of compelling to me,  so I'm on the fence.

This is actually pretty poor design, that should be a square checkbox and not a circular multiple choice option if they wanted to conform to the standard most GUIs have used for ages. That's because that's godawful design.  Too late for any explanations, I've already begun my transition to Hardcore! Go ahead, I DARE you to assume my gender!!! Finally, Worshippers of Slannesh have an option they can select.  Wouldn't surprise me if it was a new gender in todays world.  There are way more genders than Male Female and Hardcore, how offensive! wouldn't be surprised if it was a third gender option. Glad to see that my gender is finally being represented Oh sweet.  Another grim Dawn player.  The game is Grim Dawn. /r/crappydesign Software/UI dev here. Spacing form elements is kind of important. ;) That button is reserved for super mutants. Sounds better than attack helicopter /r/crappdesign Hardcore: Ten dicks and ten pussies [Popular Russian interpretation](http://cs8.pikabu.ru/post_img/2016/03/28/9/1459178638197634373.png) If we were to genuinely have a third gender, that could be a fun one. /r/shittyui I'll have you know I identify as HARDCORE! My pronouns are dude/bro/broseph.  What is the name of the game? Female is easy mode Did you just assume my DIFFICULTY!?! Did you just assume my difficulty level? Hardcore should be a gender. I am very intrigued to know what a "Hardcore" gender would look like. To be fair. That's a shitty place to put that.  Finally people who identify as hardcore have been able to overcome this last hurdle of oppression by having an option to select it in a video game. "Excuse me, sir..."

"Did you just assume my gender?"

"Sorry... Excuse me, hardcore?"

Edit: I'll take the downvotes. I made me laugh. PENIS AND VAGINA!   No Tumblr, Hardcore is not a gender. Okay...male or female?

SURE WHY NOT I'm a non binary hardcore. I had a survey the other day that asked for gender. Male, female, transgender or other....WTF is other....pony? Still laughing Did you just assume my difficulty?  Male

Female

Attack Helicopter As an Apache helicopter I find that oppressive  r/asktransgender might appreciate this. "Are you male or female ?"

"I'm hardcore"

"But what's in your pants?"

"Difficulty" Well that's fine, there are only two genders after all... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-mPnmfrm6I What game is this from? I'm guessing it would be having a dick and a vagina? Yeah, that's a bad UI design.  Hardcore should be a checkbox. "I mean, what's in your pants?"

"Difficulty."

So basically the 3rd option is Brock Lesnar? Game is Grim Dawn if anyone is interested. It's pretty decent.  It's supposed to be insanely difficult. I'm still playing it through on Male.

Only 80s kids will get it. That makes for downs. bristling with breasts and penises both! Broforce needs that option.  Yeah more chromosomes is always a good thing. Its illegal to ask those questions in Canada  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Not OP but am pretty sure it's Grim Dawn.  A rather excellent ARPG similar to Diablo. I don't visit this sub often but when I do this is always a comment. Why aren't people required to but the names in brackets or something? Can confirm, Grim Dawn. If only there was a way we could avoid having to ask this on every post... https://gfycat.com/PeriodicGoldenAfricangoldencat That's not a radio, that's a computer.

I feel like that acronym is missing about 37 letters from when I saw it last H? What is H? Sorry, I'm not caught up on my gender pronouns for 2016.

edit: While yes, I am making a joke, I am also being serious. Don't know what H means. Maybe the radio button was preventing a game crash that nobody knew why and it is literally impossible to fix it without delaying the game months! 

 "Gold drops are reduced by 23%"

Strong myth peddling
 You forgot that male enemies can't attack you as a female. Someone must've mixed up my gender settings... 🙁 >Gold drops are reduced by 23%.

Excellent Although, like most games, it's easier today than it was 20 years ago.    "Being gay is a choice!"

Paging /u/BorkTalk  It's Brock Samson  No, it's Brock Sampson. How is it compared to the newly updated Titan Quest? I know GD is supposed to be the spiritual successor, but the update was pretty substantial from what I've heard. Unfortunately, it's just decent. Supported it since early access, and while I wouldn't say I'm disappointed with it, it's not all that impressive either. It's probably better this way. There are rumors that on "Female" you get a 20% decreased drop rate. If you play it through on female, all the dialogue options are passive-aggressive and the best response is always the one that looks least likely to work. The major conflict points revolve around the antagonist refusing to talk about his feelings. Oh Oglaf, you wonderful amalgamation of sex, humor, and sex. Love that comic. I want to work someplace that this stuff is ok. That's enough Reddit for me for today. :/

For some reason I assumed the warning was a joke.... It wasn't. It was entirely too accurate.

Welp, you know what they say about assumptions, they make an ass out of you and me. :/ If worked at a place that was ok with that I would be a happy man. Or a fluffer.  /r/suddenlygay r/vikingsgonewild So.. PornHub? Same in the US. Age? Really? Yup. It's a spiritual successor to Titan Quest, and they're planning an expansion pack some time later.

I've been having a blast with it, clocked in a lot of hours with it. I wanted to give Grim Dawn a try, but I don't like the thought of paying for *another* ARPG.

The dual class system seems interesting, but it also seems like classes are fairly superficial in the same way that Path of Exile's systems are, and I didn't like Path of Exile because of that.

I also barely hear anyone talking about it, which doesn't do much to inspire my confidence.

At the same time, I really want another ARPG and I'm waiting on the edge of my seat for Lost Ark.

Plus on the Steam page "over 35 quests!" as if that's a lot doesn't exactly make me feel like there is a lot of content justifying the price. Has it gotten better? I played it during really early access, and even then I liked it. IIRC, there was the rule at some point, but the mods didn't really want to remove 95% of all content as noone is capable of reading so the rule is gone now again. Yep, very recognizable UI Back in my day we didn't have no fancy radio, we used smoke signals  There is a little bit. I'd say it needs a lot. is there a r/retiredgifs but for pictures? Or sandpaper toilet tissue Or a bidet with an industrial-grade pressure washer.
 LGBTQOMGWTFBBQ there was a time when i would see LGBT+ and i thought that worked well enough.  The full term nowadays is LGBTQIA+. The community finally decided to stick a plus sign on the end to stop the nonsensical growing of it, I guess. 

I think it goes:

Lesbian

Gay

Bisexual

Transsexual

Queer

Intergender(? I think) 

Asexual/Ally, it depends on who you ask. 
 Hardcore. Don't know either.  I'm used to it being LGBTQA. Hermaphodite, maybe? Though I really think most people born like that pick one gender or the other to stick with.

Either that or Hardcore to fit with the joke of this thread. Nah  Yeah, I'd buy that for a quarter. But humorous nonetheless Ok, how about "The game encourages you to take quests and fight monsters that on average reduce the gold you earned by 23%" I'll say Dog it's a fuckin joke. You know how SJWs get offended way to easily? You're them, just on the opposite side of the spectrum.  Happens a lot lately. agh, i wish i thought of that! so good! Funny joke but I feel the need to point out that it is not necessarily true, believe it or not. I remember I once read the results of a studies of transgender people from the 90s' and it found that the majority of them disapproved of media highlighting transgender people because it made it easier for people who aren't transgender to spot those who aren't and many live their lives in [stealth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(gender)#Stealth) Those surveyed thought it would make life harder for them. They weren't wrong either since when people know more about transgender people and many things revolving the lives of transgender people it is easier to spot them. After all, simply having knowledge about transgender people doesn't guarantee that you will use that information earnestly and positively. That increase in media attention we've seen over the past two decades mixed in with the fact that the internet makes it extraordinarily more difficult to live in stealth or [just not be Daily Mail'd to death by flagrant bigots](http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/trans_woman_commits_suicide_after_being_bullied_by_the_daily_mail) and that hate crime against transgender people is actually rising, which is being facilitated by new legislation that conservatives are carting out since they can't cart out as much anti-gay legislation, legislation like the bathroom bills that force transgender people into a situation where they either break the law or out themselves (and expose themselves to danger), and its not hard to think that things are getting worse. With the Obergefel v. Hodges ruling a lot of the transgender community thought that things were going to get worse for transgender people in the following years before it gets better and frankly it looks like that is the case. Guys who really like cock duh... I think people who say sexuality is a choice are actually bisexual, and they literally did make a choice.

For me, I'm straight, and I never made a choice about it. I was attracted to girls from a very young age, completely involuntarily, even before I knew what it meant. 

EDIT: I really wish people would explain their downvotes. It seems pretty straightforward to me. I'm saying that sexuality is not a choice, and the only people who claim they made a choice to be straight or gay are actually "naturally" bisexual; i.e. they didn't have a choice. 

EDIT 2: Now my edit looks silly because I'm at a positive karma. At one point, it was -2 and controversial.  Choosing trans as your gender seems like you're going against all that it means to be trans Can also confirm. Yayyy.  Woo go us :( HC club!  You use squares for checkboxes.

Just realized I made some checkboxes round for the mod I'm working on. Radio buttons (circles) are for "select 1 option from multiple options". You can only switch to other options.

Checkboxes (squares) are for "select any number of options from any number of options". Reclicking the box will remove the check. When you ask why it's a disgrace to use circles to indicate checkboxes, you are a disgrace as a user.

Furiously clicks hardcore button
   
This should be reddit's motto. Betcha you run out of energy on an even number of clicks. [Im here to ask only one question and one question only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbex7bVUHo) I first read that as Mr. Tongue #EXPLOSIONS Brock Samson; comes equipped with powerful vintage transportation, razor sharp knife, side quests pertaining to the feminine gender, and the complete works of Led Zeppelin* during adventures [*=with toggle option of In Through The Out Door; drum solo track titled "Moby Dick" cannot be erased and will increase in volume after each attempt] I don't get the reference  Grim Dawn has better feeling combat. Also the gothic atmosphere is more appealing to me than the Greek one. Grim dawn also has an added layer of character customisation with the addition of the constellation.

I'd recommend playing both repeatedly but Grim dawn is definitely my preference. > Grim Dawn

I agree with Vacbs. I think TQ's world, art style, music, atmosphere, etc is a really cool and is better. The combat is a lot better than TQ though. I love both for sure, but GD takes the cake

Fwiw it's on sale on steam right now for $15 and on humble you can sign up for one month for $12 and get GD + 4 or 5 other games at the end of the month. I think if you get it on humble you can buy the dlc at a discount too? Just a survival mode, but it's fun and cheap They're only rumors. The statistics don't account for the fact that Female players tend to avoid stronger enemies, so obviously they get worse drop rates. That's on top of the fact that the average Female player fights less enemies overall, which the statistics don't attempt to account for. And sometimes, even more sex.  I don't care so much for the sex jokes, but I really appreciate it for its artistic value. 

[Hm, such delicious drawn cock...](/spoiler) [Thank me later](http://bad-dragon.com/jobs) You can just ask if someone is of legal age afaik otherwise it could be considered discrimination.  Yes it can make an employer view you as inexperienced or too old for the job.  To this day, I still play Titan Quest. Grim Dawn has been an awkward switch, but I enjoy it  108 hours in the past month, which is a lot considering I work full time. It eats at my free time.  Grim Dawn day 1 backer here with 500 hours.

I just want to say that you are most certainly overthinking the purchase. The reason you don't hear many people talking about it is because it isn't a faux-MMOARPG like D3 and PoE. Its a small project that was kickstarted by the developers of Titan Quest as its spiritual successor, and aimed to keep the same style of multiplayer TQ and games from the early 2000s had. Theres much less focus on 'meta' or flavor of the months builds because the scope of the game is pretty well contained within itself. Sure, you can minmax and max out your character in a about 100-150 hours of play -- but the community that creates the meta that other ARPGs these days develop simply are too small to really impact the game. Granted, the devs balance the masteries with each patch but very rarely will be changinf much other than a few number values to normalize damage imbalances.

As for being afraid that dual classing is superficial, it is very much not. What you call classes are actually referred to as masteries, and your choice of the teo determines your class. Generally your choice will point you in a certain direction; for example, if you chose Nightblade and Arcanist you would be lending your characters skillset to deal cold, frostburn, and physical damage. Within that general direction you can then skill to play as a caster, melee, ranged, or hybrid... really whatever you want, there is a ton of freedom within each class, all of which have Legendary and Epic items tailored to their own playstyle.

And its funny that you say 35 quests makes you worry... the campaign itself quite a bit longer than both PoE and D3, which is meant to be played on 3 difficulties and would take you roughly 80+ hours to complete and another 50-ish (if its your first character) to do end-game farming runs and max out your character.

One last thing, Grim Dawn is the headlining game for next months Humble Monthly, which is only about $12 and you'd get the game immediately, and then the rest of the bundle on (edit) Oct 2nd.

 The quests in Grim Dawn are ancillary and are completed without much effort as you progress through the map. The real gameplay imo is the theorycrafting and figuring out how to progress through the map as fast as possible without dying. When you hit Ultimate (the hardest iteration of the game) you will be challenged on nearly every aspect - DPS, resists, HP, buffs/debuffs. I already have nearly 500 hours into the game, and I can easily see myself going back to it for a long time. >Plus on the Steam page "over 35 quests!" as if that's a lot doesn't exactly make me feel like there is a lot of content justifying the price.


you do realize its an arpg right?

diablo 2 had something like 6 quests per act, diablo 3 which is a recent game still didnt have a lot of quests per act.

titan quest has an overall main story with sidequests to complete, feels like theres more of those than most arpgs would have, but since when does that even matter?

an arpg is about killing a lot of monsters, just look at someone playing it on youtube and that should be enough to tell if its the kind of arpg you'd enjoy. I've been playing co-op with my brother and we are nearly 30 hours into it and only around 75% of the way done judging by how much of the map is left. Usually you also have 3 or 4 quests going at the same time too, there are only a few places we've come across where you've only got one, and I love that.  Yeah 35 doesn't sound much, but they're fairly fleshed out.  Around 30/40 hours gameplay I'd reckon (depends on what you do obviously).  The game is exceedingly similar to Path of Exile though, and if you disliked that then I'd probably swerve GD.  Maybe pick it up on a sale sometime.  I'm not really an ARPG fan tbh, but I enjoyed this one. > Grim Dawn

I agree with what Postwar said, but wanted to add something else on top. This isn't a AAA title, the game started out as 2 guys with a dream and a kickstarter page. There is legit 0 advertising outside of word of mouth or a review here and there. They have I think 600k ish copies sold and I've never seen an outright bad review, pretty good all things considered. I know a lot of people who just play it when they are a bit burned out on on PoE/D3 and even those guys think it's well worth the 25 bucks plus a lot of guys who ditched said games (esp d3) for it :p

When the fuck is Lost Ark even going to come out ;( Last I heard they were doing beta testing this year but it was going to be Korea only I think? NEver see any info or updates on it. Hard to say if it'll actually be good, but it sure as shit looks cool I'm really enjoying it even though it's not my usual thing.  I've only recently started it though so have no idea how it used to play.  Apparently it's on humble bundle right now with some other games for $12 or so. Which is really unfortunate. I'm pretty sure /r/tattoos requires the name and location of the artist that created the tattoo, and /r/earthporn requires a location and resolution iirc. I've never seen a post that broke those rules get any traction but the subs are still active. 

I think the mods just need to try it again, I'd even be willing to help sort through posts and reapprove things that needed a resubmission.  They could have an automoderator require name in brackets or parenthesis "What does that smoke signal say?"

"It says, 'Help. My blanket is on fire'." I say it needs a line separator. /r/retiredjpg On the ceiling That OMGWTFBBQ joke is so old that it has become a classic. Hey, don't bring me into this mess LGBTOFWGKTA I've never seen the term "intergender". As I understand it, "queer" refers to "genderqueer" and "non-binary gender", which mostly refer to socialisation/presentation, whereas "intersex" refers mostly to ambiguous physical features, ambiguous genitals in particular. I've also seen a second Q for "questioning". LGBTQIAA+  Oh doh, hardcore would make sense there. Hermaphrodite generally means something else than what you're thinking. The correct term would be intersexed. They use intersex now. Hermaphrodite refers to animals, like hermaphroditic clams and worms.  And then when you do decide to take the lucrative quests, the monsters fall all over themselves to interview you. Hah! Gay people are so gay! I think people are misinterpreting your comment as offensive (though your wording is a bit weird so I see why).

I read it as next time I hear some asshat saying being gay is a choice I'm going to retort with "oh so you are capable of being attracted to both but chose one? That makes you bisexual. Welcome to the lgbtq community." It's true in some cases. I don't hear it so much from straight people, but I've definitely met gay people who say:

"Look, obviously I'm attracted to the opposite sex. I'm only human. But I'm 100% gay."

Pro-tip - the correct reply to this is *not* "I dunno, that sounds pretty bi to me." That gets you yelled at. There is a lot of biphobia on the gay scene. Im bisexual. Not a choice. I didnt choose to be attracted to men i just am. I look at some guys and im just attracted to them. The choice comes in acting on my attractions but i dont ever remember choosing to like cock. I just do. I do masturbate my own cock but i also enjoy other dudes cocks as well.  But i also fucking love pussy.  I love eating it and fucking it. And tits.  Love hot tits. Not on men though dont like mens tits. 

Edit: i will say that some dudes have declined dates bc im bi and not gay. And some girls have declined dates as well.  They seem to think it entails me dating a man and a woman but im monogamous and ive never done a threesome i wouldnt want to. Im not in the mood for cock the same time im in the mood for pussy usually. Not entirely sure what gets me in the mood for either i just wake up one day and want cock. Or pussy. What really trips gorlfriends is if i watch gay porn.  Or if im dating a guy and they see straight porn or lesbian porn. Ultimately its about finding someone who i can date and i love being around and it doesnt matte rif its a dude or a girl. And now i have the option to marry either. But if i married a guy i wouldnt consider myself gay and if i married a woman i wouldnt consider myself straight bc im still attracted to either sex.  I too am a part of this.  Quasi-crossdresser here.  Sufficiently hardcore? I get that but why is doing it differently disgraceful? Oooookay... /r/2meirl4meirl Undertale. Not the bathroom thing though, that's not from the game. Undertale. Belowstory. Cave story He turns the people he drinks into roids or something, so he doesn't really have that much use for a dick... [Naw man that's a mouth.](https://youtu.be/GkFalxjWhyk?t=10s) It doesn't have nads, it's genital is the sucky tail thing.  Well it's not uncommon in various species to have genitalia under some sort of protective covering that it can emerge from. The human forskin could be a remnant of that and it would make sense for cell. That said, I think it was unnecessary for him and his tail thing is a replacement for genitalia. 

Consumption instead of reproduction. I prefer to think of that as the door to a compartment that opens and the monster pops out.  > Well, Cell never wears any cloths. 

Or clothes for that matter. There's a dick if you squint a bit You can never go wrong with a shakira gif Risky click of the day Is Shakira hardcore *now*? This post had too many syllables. **APOLOGIZE** I only hear Mr. Satan when he talks. ExPloSHUNNSSS? Your post made scroll up to realize it didn't say Mr. Tongue... *THAT'S MR. TORGUE TO YOU* #? The fact that Brock Sampson only listens to zeppelin makes the greatest cartoon caraxhtee of all time I told you <grunt> this would go a lot easier <GRUNT> if I had a CIGARETTE! I've heard that too. But then there are apparently also cases, where females ran the same dungeon and got overall less drops. Some claim it's because they more frequently play supporting classes that tend to get worse drop rates. So it's not really obvious what is going on there. Also, very interestingly, at lower levels it appears that females actually get higher drop rates, but those are eclipsed later in the level curve by males. Bespoke fucks Time to update (make up lies) my resume. Love these people.
Recommend them 1000 times! Isn't that the employer's right to decide. Titanquest is one of my favorite ganes of all time. I had a super high level haruspex that got deleted when my hard drive wiped :( Did you know titan quest anniversary edition came out recently? I haven't tried it myself but enjoyed the original.  Really? I thought it wouldn't be all that jarring for a Titan Quest player, since certain mechanics from TQ are in Grim Dawn, like the Mastery system.

Not to mention, I heard that the areas of Cairn are more "concise" than the ones in Titan Quest, fewer "filler" areas between key questing areas. [removed] You just sold me this game. Very well said, man. So buy the bundle now and i get grim dawn oct 2nd? It's in the Humble Monthly bundle right now for $12 plus five other games
 I enjoyed Diablo and Torchlight 2. Grim Dawn looked like an interesting game after those. And a hole in the floor. Not just to pee/poop in, more as an obstacle you have to jump or climb around. The outer ring of the hole is slippery and slopes inward. It's not classic though, it's BBQ. Lays are serious. It applies so well to the alphabet soup that people try to make with the LGBT acronym.  O RLY? Nonbinary people are intended to be included under "trans". Since trans just means not identifying with your birth assigned gender. 

Queer is a catch all term that is deliberately vague. It refers to anyone who identifies as non-hetero,  but doesnt want to use a more specific label for whatever reason.  Maybe their sexuality is more complicated than can be explained well with one word, maybe they regect western labels for cultural reasons,  maybe theyre still undecided. 

Queer is also used to describe the entire community

Genderqueer is similar, but for gender identity. It is a type of nonbinary gender. Others being agender,  genderfluid,  or cultural genders like two-spirit, fa'afafine etc Ah, forgot I actually. What's the second A for?  Dont forget bi people theyre kinda gay That's how I intended it.  It's almost like we figured out [sexuality was a spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale) over 60 years ago. I've never met a gay person who said that- let alone many. I'm kinda bi. In that men are mostly aesthetically pleasing, some of them kinda sexy, but the thought of sex or anything intimate really with a guy turns me off big time. Yeah but some bisexual people make the choice to ignore half of their sexuality. It's a sad choice, but one that is possible to make and get away with indefinitely.

It's different with closeted gay people because being in the closet means you're forced to constantly prove that you're attracted to a gender that you're not attracted to *and* pretend they're not attracted to a gender they are attracted to. 

With bisexual people they just have to pretend they're not attracted to one of the genders they're attracted to. IMO it's substantially easier to do, even if it's still not healthy. I pretend that I'm not attracted to attractive straight guys all the time and it probably isn't that great for my mental health either but it's just a fact of life. Similarly, I would have a much easier time pretending to be asexual (as is often the case for closeted gay men who want to be left alone) than pretending to be straight. > Im bisexual. Not a choice. 

That's fine, but it's the polar opposite of what I said.

I never said "people who are bisexual made a choice." I said "people who think sexuality a choice are bisexual." Those are two very different statements. 
 > Edit: i will say that some dudes have declined dates bc im bi and not gay.

What's the rationale behind this? Is it just a feel that you won't be viable for a serious relationship because you aren't "really" gay? Lol you and I are exactly the same. Lucky for me I didn't get a date cancelled because my gf is also bi. We *could* have a threesome, but it's weird having another dude fuck my gf so I decided not to. And another thing. I agree with all of the above statements. I honestly don't know if I made a choice or not. Originally I knew I was straight, and have always been straight. Recently I've liked some guys too so I don't know. I kind made the choice and only told a few of my good friends and they are cool with it. Thanks for sharing your story though!  Yipiee... Playing Life on hardcore mode sucks. Damn.... I don't know how much of that is just suicide humor and how much is a cry for help.  /r/2meirl4meirl 2: Electric Bugaloo You never found the secret bathrooms?

Dude you missed a massive part of the game, you need to play it again. yeah the fills you with determination thing Na, it's just that his tail does more than absorb people... [Full episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMfTDFIdRQw), for those interested. Haha. Abridged?  Which was fucking TERRIFYING to watch as a kid.  Except Cell is not a member of a species, he was made in a lab out of the DNA or Cells of the best fighters in the world. That's what I told my last date. :( http://i.imgur.com/zOrK6uW.gif I was disappointed. I believe she is "*furiously clicks*". TESTOSTERONE!!! Easily one of the most entertaining characters in the series.  YEAAA AHHHH!!! BUNCH OF AMATEURS USIN MAGIC TRICKS!!  Oh shit, I totally didn't realize that! It was many years between when I last watched the DBZ dub to when I played Borderlands 2. 

Also, thank you for using the character's real name. http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Torgue

He's the CEO of a gun manufacturer in the Borderlands games. All their guns shoot explosive bullets. He's an NPC in game and he's always yelling about explosions. I love how he crushed a mans hand and them threw him across the goddamn room...



...with his *butthole*.  Well of course not everyone who runs the same dungeon at the same time gets the same drops. Not all players are equally useful in the group, a level 80 DPS should totally be getting more and better drops than a level 60 DPS who's really just leeching for XP. A healer with a decade of playing healing specs is going to be better than a healer that recently switched to the healing spec and isn't as experienced with it. Female difficulty players tend to stay in a specific spec for a shorter amount of time, and they generally aren't as good at mix/maxing to fit their role as well. Class plays a role too, not every weapon is a hunter weapon anymore, and healers really have no business taking sword drops when the DPS could actually be using them. 

It's extremely well documented that players on Female difficulty tend to pick dungeons that are easier to run, instead of picking dungeons with the best possible loot table for their character as Male difficultly characters tend to do. Female difficulty players run less dungeons on average, and run easier dungeons on top of that, it should be obvious why they tend to have less loot overall. Chooses female.

Dances on mailbox.

Get free epics and gold.

Just tested. Female difficulty is in fact easier. When I play male, I agro all the mobs. As female, they form a protective circle around me and buy me gear. No. Choosing someone for employment based off Age, race, sex, etc are all discrimination and illegal in American and Canada as far as I'm aware.  That's rough, man :-/ With how long the storyline takes, I know that's a big loss. Already clocked 22 hours into Anniversary Edition. Bought five extra copies to give away, but haven't gotten around to it yet. My biggest issue with is has been the ambiguity. My best friend and I both agreed on that. We were playing it for a couple hours, but we weren't entirely certain what we'd ACCOMPLISHED. Oooh boy, okay.

Titan Quest is a Diablo II-esque ARPG. It has very linear gameplay at first glance, but as you play you learn more ways to play it.

Including the expansion, Immortal Throne, there are 9 different "Masteries" to pick from at level 2. After that, you can pick a second mastery at level 8. I think that works out to 45 different combinations(?), including the option to not pick a second mastery. *But*, each mastery has a variety of skills you can use. All of which are alike enough that they synergize well, but different enough that you can actually build your character several different ways within the Mastery. So make that 90 different ways to play the game.

As of now, it takes roughly 24 hours of gameplay to finish the main story. After that, you have the Immortal Throne expansion that gives you a good 10-12 hours of content. Or more. It's hard to say.

Realistically, if you play only a third of those combinations, that's 30 different playstyles to last you 30+ hours each. 900 hours of gameplay.

And it has multiplayer, so you can play with your friends. Everything scales, so it's just as difficult with multiple players as it is solo. But you get more variety in combat, as well as slightly better luck with rare item drops.

Basically, it's a linear game that was made to be replayable. I also don't really get why they don't try to think of an actual word that people could use to include everyone. Aliasing Ally "Allies" I'm pretty sure. They're semi-gay. Quasi-gay. They're the diet coke of gay. Meet more gay people. When gay people trust you they will often admit to being capable of opposite sex attraction but just generally strongly preferring members of the same-sex. It's an unspoken thing in the gay community, for the obvious reasons that anti-LGBTQ+ people would use it as a point of invalidation and shaming.

This isn't every gay person obviously. Maybe not even most. But it's definitely a size-able population. Did I say 'many'? :/ Maybe I'm misreading your tone as confrontational when it's not. I haven't met 'many' gay people who have said that. But of the many gay people I've met, I can remember three who have said that - or two who said it explicitly and one who said words that effect. I'm not saying it's common, just that I've encountered it and that it gave me pause for thought.  I don't know you. But that sounds more like you're just secure and can appreciate the attractiveness of men. > the thought of sex or anything intimate really with a guy turns me off big time

which is commonly referred to as "not being bi" I never said you said anything. 

I disagree though i dont know anyone who thinks sexuality is a choice is bisexual.  But some people could be like that sure i just dont know any. I would love to talk to someone who is bi and thinks sexuality is a choice though bc i dont understand how.  Yes or that ill just cheat on them when i see a hot chick. And the overall rationale that im just confused and havent picked sides yet. That you can be one or the other. Of course no one on adam4adam.com cares bc its just about sex I'm bi and this is true. I don't like men as passionately as a full gay person.  Many in the gay community feel that bisexual people are going to use them to experiment with their sexuality and then eventually discard them to go live a much more normative and socially acceptable life with a member of the opposite sex.  Well the difference is that i knew i liked men since i was 14 Indeed Sure, if you let Zone-tan tell it. Abridged is my canon.  What you call terrifying, I call arousing. Exactly, hence why I suggested the tail was intended to make consumption a replacement function. Hoped I ninja edited fast enough but was wrong!

It's not impossible that he's able to reproduce sexually, presumably with one of species his dna came from. DBZ doesn't exactly seem to be particularly interested in accurately representing xenogenetics after all, but since he's never shown interest replacement seems more likely.  God dammit What the fuck He stands corrected. Ouch I recognized it right away, because I played the shit out of DBZ Budokai 3 when I was in High School/college. Also, Chris Sabat (who does the voice of Torgue/Satan, among others) has a very distinctive voice. 

Also, if you haven't started watching DBZ abridged, get to YouTube and start right this second. I was adding the "?" because the line was "I have one question for you: explosions?" with the word "Explosions" enunciated as though it were a question.  It is hard to see that I put "#?" I'm 17 and think it's ridiculous I wouldn't have to disclose that in an interview.  hello its me ur brother are you gonna do some sort of internet give away?
 I bought it on sale for 5€. It's the second time I actually bought the game (I have a physical copy without the expansion). Does the online mode works at all? soo are you still giving them away ? There actually is! I call us Gender and Sexual Minorities or GSM, though some people think we should include romantic identities (think things like asexual people who like to be in romantic relationships or polyamorous people) as well, so "Gender, Sexual, and Romantic Minorities" or GSRM. I have no idea what else we could add to that. The club at my University used QUILTBAG: Queer, Undecided, Intersex, Lesbian, Transgender, Bisexual, Asexual, Gay. there is: queer

But some older people remember when it meant you were about to get beaten up so they dont like it.  Just thinking out loud, but maybe then you need a new word for people who come afterwards who don't identify with that specific grouping. Acronyms you can just keep expanding forever and include more and more.  MOGAI is one I've seen a lot. Marginalized Orientations Genders Asexual and Intersex.  I don't really know, but I think it might be because they all have issues in the past with not fitting the one or two generalized variables, meant to include everyone. I say LGBTQ+ where + means "everyone else". Though logically that extends to literally everyone so idk I've always found allies being in the acronym a little odd.  Im bi. Now im going to go around saying im the diet coke of gay.  Thank you for that comparison. Honestly id like fresca better Just one calorie, not gay enough! I think he means closeted bi sexuals, e.g. The more classic example of someone whose upbringing demonized a ting other than being straight found themselves attracted to same sex people as well as opposite sex people and literally chose to ignore half of their sexual orientation and therefore think that is true of everyone.  Uh,  if you were gay,  then what would stop you from cheating with other men?  That doesn't make sense!  Is there some promiscuous myth or something?  I'm 14 right now. So there isn't a difference? I just realized it like 2 months ago that I liked men. Tell me more.  Yep, krillins voice in abridged makes it for me I cant stand the cannon voices now they seem off to me "Ki Ko Fuck Yourself"

"Awww, see. That's the spirit" I read that in Super Kami guru's voice My apologies

I don't mean others are bad

Torgue says funny things Oh trust me, I've been watching TeamFourStar's work for many years, now. They're just about to get to Mr. Satan's debut, and I can't wait to see where they go with his character! Good thing you have a year to wisen up before you subject the rest of us to your shortsightedness at the ballot box. The only thing you'd have to disclose is whether you are of legal age to do whatever the job entails, that's it. Check back in a couple days once I put up a giveaway thread. I usually request funny pictures of bears. Yeah, once I get around to making the thread. Yep! It's all fixed now, with official support.

To date, I believe I've bought... around 17 copies? Usually when it's on sale. Between giving it away online and buying copies for friends, it's really added up. As mentioned in several other comments, I will be once I finally put up a giveaway thread for it. And then you guys can progress to WCDMA and LTE... GSM is fine.  "Romantic identities"  is something that doesn't need a qualifier or pronoun.
 I'm sure they'll think of something GSM is fine.  "Romantic identities"  is something that doesn't need a qualifier or pronoun.
 sounds like some derogatory call, if you didn't know what it meant. 

"... And that's where the QUILTBAGs meet" "OMG don't call them that" [deleted] I dunno, that sounds like something i'd say as an insult.  Yeah, I think queer sounds kinda weird and derogatory. I think it's a great word and stops that gatekeeping that lets people go "you're not xyz enough to be considered LGBT". But I do understand how many people dislike the term. I get what you're saying, but I (and I think a lot of other people) don't care enough about these issues to keep up with an expanding abbreviation (although, honestly I think only a fringe group wants to keep expanding it) but I can learn one new word. Language needs to actually be useable. After LGBT, I just call them attack helicopters. There are a few terms that are meant to be more inclusive, like GSM (Gender/Sexual Minorities), but they haven't really taken off because the older acronym has been prominent for so long. It's also not normally a very serious problem IRL. Outside of parody and discussion of the need for a better term, it's more common for major organizations to add a + sign than to make the acronym arbitrarily long. Huh. i like it. Can we make it national? Please? It's just so much easier to say. Np. I felt kind of bad because I know people say that sort of shit without irony all too often, but I couldn't resist the opportunity for a good Austin Powers reference...  Lemme guess, you enjoy the gay, but don't want all the calories?  Then there's metrosexual. Gay Zero. The same gay taste without the sexuality. Holy shit can this be true? I love reading all of these comments because I recently found out I was bi and you guys are having some really good info. I'm really closseted, not because I'm afraid to come out (I'm sure none of my friends or family would care) but it's because I'm not even sure if I'm bi. What you said makes sence.  > promiscuous myth 

i dunno if its a myth, but it certainly is a stereotype maybe? Oh. Well I didn't know that. If you're curious about your sexuality that's pretty normal for your age. You'll find yourself and who you are in the next few years. I knew I liked men when I was 14 as I started having sex with guys when I was 14. But I don't think I put together that I was bisexual until I was a little older. I thought for a while that I was gay and something was wrong with me.  TFS Krillin and TFS Goku are my defaults when I read the manga now. So good for a youtube series. Like [this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oymAApEbIho) Okay, good. I was going to make a Mark Satan joke earlier, but was afraid you wouldn't get it. Now I feel sad because you probably would have. Why? What's wrong with that? Experience is important when it comes to working. I shouldn't be considered equal to a 30 year old, because I'm not. That's why I can't vote yet. I can't just go to a voting panel and refuse to disclose my age, so why should I be able to when finding a job? bears?

superbear got you covered fam

 cool, hope i catch it i realy want it but don't have the cash atm. Dude... 17? ಠ_ಠ See, that's where the entire problem with the 'LGBT+ alphabet soup' came from and why it's a problem at all. Where do you draw the line? Sure, romantic identities are not relevant for most non-straight people, but in the same way sexual identities are not relevant for the majority of the general population. Yeah you like that word don't you quiltbag It's perfect. Works on so many levels. Why is this getting down voted? It's true. A lot of people do still use it as a derogatory term.  That's because it is, it's a synonym for strange or odd. I don't think calling a large group of people strange is the best way to progress. 
I'd rather just talk for you and me than the people you think you might be speaking for, because I don't feel strongly about this. 
I'm just thinking about why people use the word "gay" or "lesbian" in some circumstances, and then LGBT in another. And it's because in one they are referring to a very specific group, and in another to a broader more inclusive and open ended group. "LGBT" refers to a group just as well (and poorly) as a different word would, and has already achieved some general recognition. Inventing a new word wouldn't seem to solve for your case of "can't keep up with all these new words". 

I don't think you need to "keep up" with it. Just refer to the group you mean. If you don't know about a group, don't refer to them.  nice meme!  /r/im14andthisisfunny i dont care about calories i like fresca taste You see, if I wanted to have sex with guys, I would have tell them I'm bisexual. I just don't know if I wanna come out cause as you said, I'm still learning over the next few years. What did you do to get with guys? It's just all new to me.  Muffin button is still my favorite part of the whole series Not really sure if I would have, to be honest. I've never seen the name "Mark" associated with Mr. Satan before. They can ask you how much experience you have doing something, if it's relevant, and they can ask you if you're the minimum age required, but they can't ask your specific age.  Somebody who is 40 doesn't necessarily have any more experience doing a particular job than somebody who is 20. I'm 26 and have more experience and knowledge of electronics, residential wiring, automotive work than my 60yr old dad. Should he get the job wiring your house or should I? They ask about your experience related to the job you're after. Your age is irrelevant. 

My cousin is 20 and has been working on cars since he was 13.that gives him roughly 6-7 years of experience over someone who just changes their own oil from time to time and happens to be 40.

Do you get it yet?  Fair enough. I'll try to remember to come back to you when I do. I usually ask for funny pictures of bears to pick the winners. Best of luck. I'm a very big fan of Titan Quest. Yup,  that's a good point. My idea that gender identities are the limit is arbitrary.  a lot of people also use gay as an insult and derogatory term but you see plenty of gay guys calling themselves gay without a bat of an eye.  In the literal sense, there's nothing derogatory about 'strange'. It's just the opposite of the normal which, in this case, holds true.  Well when I was 14 was a different time than now that you're 14. Gay marriage wasnt as accepted and generally things were different. That was 17 years ago for me. 

I would suggest talking to a counselor about it honestly. One that specializes or has experience talking to gay/bi teenagers. Maybe ask your school counselor for a referral? 

I went online in AOL chatrooms and started meeting guys to fuck. I wouldn't recommend doing that at all. 

If you're school has a gay/straight alliance, i would recommend going to one of those meetings and find someone you can talk to that won't out you. 

Also /r/lgbt is a good place to go.
